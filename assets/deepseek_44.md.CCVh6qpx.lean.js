(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Today The film begins with commentary by passenger Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) having suffered a car accident with his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito). He mentions that the citizens of Los Angeles have lost their \\"sense of touch.\\" Ria and the driver of the other car, Kim Lee, exchange racially charged insults. When Waters exits the car, he arrives at a police investigation crime scene concerning the discovery of \\"a dead kid.\\" Yesterday While purchasing a revolver at a gun store, Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), argue in Persian over what box of bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as \\"Osama\\". Farhad clarifies that he is an American citizen but the store owner continues exchanging racially stereotypical insults at Farhad and has the security guard escort him out of the store. Dorri demands the store owner to give her the gun or give her back the money. After the store owner gives the gun to Dorri, she asks for \\"the ones in the red box\\". The store owner asks why, but Dorri does not answer and insists on buying that particular box. In another part of town, two black men, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate), argue over racial stereotyping of African Americans after Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock), the wife of the local district attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), walks in another direction whilst fearfully staring at them. Anthony and Peter carjack the married couple as they are about to enter their Lincoln Navigator. Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael PeÃ±a) is changing their locks when Jean notices his tattoos.

This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: JUST before the Carter Administration was ushered out into political darkness, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indulged itself in one last orgy of rule-making. By Jan. 19, the agency had proposed rules requiring, among other things, that auto makers install tire pressure warning lights on dash boards, redesign seat belts to conform to the agency's ideas of comfort and convenience, put a sticker on each new car window to tell how it performed in a 35-mile-per-hour crash test and soften front bumpers to protect pedestrians. It was a fitting finale for the Carter years. For a few hours, unrestrained by the White House or by the Cabinet Secretary for whom they nominally worked, the highway administration rule makers simply ran wild. Of course, none of it mattered. Detroit suffered one last flare-up of its ulcers before the new team busily set about sweeping up what the old had left behind. In a few weeks, the episode was just another fat, dusty volume of the Federal Register. But this final regulatory binge typified the difficulties the Carter Administration had in managing and making sense of its regulatory responsibilities. It was not for lack of trying. In 1978 the White House established a regulatory council that reviewed and categorized the handiwork of its members, the regulators. Later a regulatory analysis group was set up to review the economic impact of new proposals. But in the end it was a losing battle. The regulators were all capable, industrious and committed. They controlled the flow of facts, the timing and the range of choices. In most cases their policies were backed by large Democratic constituencies that the White House was loathe to challenge. The regulators usually had the last word. The problem was more than one of failed management. At the heart of the regulatory tug-of-war there was a basic lack of agreement over priorities and assumptions. White House economists accused the regulatory agencies of fudging the facts and playing to the galleries. The regulators tended to see those who challenged their proposals as flacks for private interests. These internal disputes, of course, mirrored the mistrust and hatred between the regulators and private industry. In the background, Ralph Nader kept up a steady howl of indiscriminate outrage, calling for the heads of all who failed his inquisition. To a degree, the lack of trust was a product of the regulatory system itself. The lawyers who designed the quasi-judicial process for setting social regulations presumed that no one involved could be trusted. Industry, with its narrow economic interests, and government, which could too easily be co-opted, could not be left alone together. Eventually, this premise became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The system called for pitched battle by legal brief, followed by an administrative decision, followed by more pitched battles in court. Low-decibel discussions, negotiations and compromise were discouraged, and in some cases were illegal. In their zeal to make the process fair, the lawyers created a multi-round, bare-knuckle boxing match, whose results often served no one's interest. Occasionally there were efforts by one party or another to break out of the vicious cycle. But eventually the process dominated the best intentions and everyone had good reason to distrust everyone else. In the year I was in the Department of Transportation I watched highway administration officials suppress and misuse information to bolster their theories, and I saw a top official of a major United States auto maker baldly lie to the Secretary of Transportation as he read cost figures from a page in front of him. ONE unfortunate outcome of this system is that there is little progress toward worthwhile social goals such as safer cars. For example, more than a decade ago the Ford Motor Company was considering installing airbags in a line of luxury cars to test their effectiveness and acceptance by consumers. Shortly before a decision was to be made, Federal safety officials issued a proposed rule to require the bags in both front and back seats. Stunned, Ford abandoned its plan and enlisted its lawyers and lobbyists in the antiairbag war in Washington. Today, 12 years later, not only are airbags unavailable, but there has never even been an adequate test of this life-saving technology. The system also often blinds the participants to their common and overriding interests. In the last four years, while Detroit and Washington shouted at each other over regulations, the Japanese quietly captured a quarter of the American auto market. Government and industry officials who should have been worrying about the productivity and competitiveness of our industry were plotting strategies for the next round of the airbag war. The new Administration is poised to roll back a number of recent regulations. But what is really needed is a thorough-going reform of the process. We must have the courage and the trust to let government and industry officials sit down calmly together to reach agreement on reasonable social objectives, strategies and timetables. Much could be done. For example, despite the highway administration's historic focus on the car and the road, it is the driver who is most responsible for highway safety. Drivers who simply buckle up and cut out excessive alcohol can reduce their chances of dying on the highway by more than half. Government and the auto industry should together undertake aggressive advertising and information campaigns to convince the public to adopt these two simple rules. As for the car itself, the objective should be to create a market for safer cars rather than continuing to mandate their design. Just as higher gas prices mooted government fuel economy regulations, the publication of technically accurate and reliable crash tests could instantly place a wonderful market premium on safer vehicles. The insurance industry, which has generally fought on the side of the regulators, could be a more constructive force - if rates rewarded seat belt users and buyers of safer cars. Criticism of past regulation does not mean that government should abdicate its role as the promoter of social objectives such as cleaner air and safer cars. The market, left to its own devices, will not always realize many of the objectives we have for our society. But government intervention into the economy must break out of its rigid combative mold. Other nations seem to find more cooperative and constructive ways for industry and government to move toward social progress. Before we can do the same, we must rewrite the laws that force government and industry to be antagonists rather than allies.

In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Matt Kenseth shocks himself, Edwards' battle within, more Texas notes Matt Kenseth, who hadn't won a Sprint Cup race since 2009, led for 169 laps at Texas -- including the final 13 (passing Kurt Busch). Matt Kenseth wasn't sure he'd ever reach victory lane again. Not winning for two years will do that to the mind of even a former champion. An otherwise mundane race was somewhat spiced with desperate pit strategies -- and Carl Edwards may or may not have obliterated a bird, which he wryly noted is a bad move for a guy so associated with a duck. 1. Ford had a productive weekend. Kenseth ended a 76-race Sprint Cup winless streak (dating back to his 2009 win at Fontana, Calif., the week after he won the Daytona 500) as all three of his Roush Fenway teammates -- Edwards (third), Greg Biffle (fourth) and pole-sitter David Ragan (seventh) -- and Ford-driving Marcos Ambrose (sixth) finished in the top 10. Edwards won the Nationwide race on Friday, putting the Mustang in Victory Lane for the first time. Also, Scott Maxwell and Joe Foster claimed the first competition victory for the Boss 302R in the Grand Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge at Barber Motorsports Park (Ala.) \\"Our cars are good right now, and we are enjoying it,\\" said Edwards, the new Sprint Cup points leader. \\"We just have to keep going.\\" 2. Kurt Busch found inspiration in his desperation. The 2004 series champion was on his way to another lackluster performance after finishing 17th at Fontana, 16th at Martinsville and falling from the points lead to fourth. By Lap 140 on Saturday night, Busch was carping about how hard he had to drive the No. 22 Dodge simply to maintain pace. So crew chief Steve Addington got creative after making major changes to the car with 135 laps remaining. \\"I didn't think we would be that much off to start the race,\\" Addington said. \\"It seemed like when we adjusted on the car, we would get different results. It's a bit of a mystery. We had to use [a different] strategy and we really shouldn't have to do that. We should be up front challenging for wins. We just need to get a handle on this thing right now.\\" Busch was able to stretch his fuel to about four laps beyond the 54-lap projected window on his next-to-last stop, giving him the lead with 77 laps remaining. Forced to pit with 55 laps left, he surrendered the lead again, took it back as those on conventional strategy pitted -- waiting for an expected caution. But the last 114 laps, amazingly, were run caution-free, and Busch ceded the front spot and a nine-second lead for the final time to Kenseth with 13 laps left. \\"Just a hard-fought battle all night,\\" said Busch, who dropped another rung to fifth in points. \\"We qualified 10th, finished 10th. We led laps when we were off-sequence, but overall a hard fought battle to get the car dialed-in once again. We struggle to make adjustments as we go. We got something towards the end to make something of it.\\" At least Busch made it. Tony Stewart, on a similar tack, ran dry on the last lap and fell from third to 12th. 3. Marcos Ambrose is either getting better or just getting in the way. The Tasmanian, in his third full Sprint Cup season, finished sixth to improve to 19th in points, made more noteworthy by the amount of carping he induced from his competitors. A week after Dale Earnhardt Jr. was lauded for his decision not to turn Kevin Harvick to break his now-100-race winless streak at Martinsville, he opined loudly over his team radio about doing just that to Ambrose. They were jostling for seventh place on Lap 245 of 334 at the time. Jimmie Johnson later had a brush with the No. 9 Ford. 4. Denny Hamlin might really be in trouble ... or maybe not. The turnaround of his miserable follow-up to a 2010 runner-up campaign was supposed to occur last week at Martinsville, where he swept last year's Cup races. (Hamlin led 89 laps but finished 12th last week because of a fuel mileage issue and pit crew issues, he said.) The turnaround was sure, then, to occur this week at Texas Motor Speedway, where he had swept the Sprint Cup races in 2010. Instead, Hamlin finished an inconsequential 15th, a lap down; and now, his early-season body of work resembles that of a driver suffering through the aftereffects of a draining and unsuccessful attempt to end Jimmie Johnson's tenure as Sprint Cup champion. Hamlin has one top-10 (7th at Las Vegas) in seven races, finished 20th or worse three times and 30th or worse twice. He is 20th in points and languishing, but wasn't as cryptic as in recent weeks in assessing the race. \\"Really, we just had one bad run and that was the one that got us caught a lap down and we just couldn't get it back,\\" he said. \\"We stayed in the 'lucky dog' position for the last -- it seemed like 150 laps, but just never got the caution to capitalize on it. Just a little frustrating, but still once again we didn't have a 15th-place car. We had about a seventh or eighth-place car, somewhere in that neighborhood.\\" 5. Do not eat Carl Edwards' mom's new dishes. Rarely does a son dare criticize his mother's cuisine. Even less frequently does he do it on live national television.

Th success of \\"Oliver!\\" on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was admirably brought to the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His charming musical then became a hit in New York and throughout the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are mind boggling. The song \\"Who Will Buy?\\" required hundreds of actors and the British film director truly deserved his Oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner.

He selected two isotopes, sample A and sample B. Sample A had longer half-life, but sample B had shorter half-life. After some time he checked sample A when its one half-life had passed. He noted it as sample A1. Then he came back to see it again when two half-lives had passed. He noted it as sample A2. Hint: Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the information given and analyze step by step: 1.

After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" Question: The democrats probably believe Options: - they will have to campaign hard - they will have a good candidate - they will hove trouble making a decision as to which candidate - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The Democrats probably believe they will have to campaign hard in order to win the 2020 U.S. presidential election. There is a diverse group of potential contenders who will vie for the Democratic party's nomination, ranging from well-known politicians like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders, to a younger, less recognizable group that includes Senators Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. Democrats are also aware of the challenges they face in winning back control of Congress, as highlighted by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren during a recent conference hosted by the Center for American Progress. Warren emphasized the need to address the concerns of millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage caused by President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. As such, the Democrats recognize the importance of not ignoring these concerns and the uphill battle they face in the upcoming elections. In light of this, it is reasonable to conclude that the Democrats believe they will have to campaign hard to gain an advantage over their competitors. This will involve selecting a strong candidate who can effectively convey the party's message and appeal to a wide range of voters, while also acknowledging the potential challenges in making a decision as to which candidate would be the best fit for the party's goals. Although there may be some uncertainty and difficulty in choosing their candidate, the awareness of these potential obstacles further reinforces the Democrats' belief in the need for a strong and dedicated campaign in the 2020 U.S. presidential election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

He Seemed to Know Death Was Coming EXCLUSIVE There's evidence Prince's death was not unexpected, because we've learned the superstar started writing his memoirs just a month ago. Sources connected with Prince tell us, they were surprised he started the project ... something he had been mulling over for years but not acting upon. We're told he had finished around 50 pages at the time of his death. What's more ... last Saturday night, after Prince was admitted to a hospital for what his reps called the flu, he addressed a crowd at Paisley Park near his home and said, \\"Wait a few days before you waste any prayers.\\" Whatever was ailing Prince, it was serious enough to sideline him several weeks ago from doing 2 shows, and it clearly lingered because he had to make an emergency landing last Friday, just 48 minutes from his home. Our sources say Prince was upset the news got out that he had been hospitalized, and feared people would think he was already dead. ||||| It was only a month ago that the publisher Spiegel & Grau announced that Prince would be publishing his memoir in the fall of 2017. But the musical artist and legend died suddenly Thursday at the age of 57, and how much of his book he had completed remains unclear.

So what happens next? That's not precisely clear. Prince did have a collaborator for the book, but to what extent they'd be teaming up —and whether that partner will go forward — isn't clear either. For his memoirs, Prince had said he would be working with his brother Dan. \\"He's a good critic, and that's what I need.

His music blended everything from rock and jazz to pop and rhythm and blues, while he donned exuberant, flamboyant outfits of all colors and textures. He performed and collaborated with seemingly everyone, from the likes of Beyoncé to Madonna. \\"Prince is a towering figure in global culture and his music has been the soundtrack for untold numbers of people — including me — for more than a generation,\\" said Chris Jackson, executive editor at Spiegel & Grau, in announcing the memoir recently. \\"Millions of words have been written about Prince — books and articles, essays and criticism — but we're thrilled to be publishing Prince's powerful reflections on his own life in his own incandescently vivid, witty, and poetic voice.\\" Will the world ever learn what, precisely, Prince had to say in those reflections?

Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \\"Kensington System\\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

Article: It is said that in the United States much has been told about that anyone can become rich and successful if he works hard and has some good luck. Yes, when one becomes rich he wants people to know it. And even though he does not become very rich, he wants people to think that he is. That's what \\"Keeping up with the Joneses \\" is about The expression was first used in 1913 by a young American called Arthur Momand looked around him and noticed that many people did things to keep up with their neighbours. He called it \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\", because Jones is a very common name in the United States. \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years. People never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read \\"right\\" books, go to \\"right\\" universities and eat in \\"right\\" restaurants. Every city has an area where people want to live because others will think better of them if they do. And there are Joneses in every city of the world.

Viewers were shown a film of what seemed to be a mugging. In this simulation, a man snatched a woman's purse. He then knocked her down and ran face forward at the camera so that the viewers got a good look at him. Viewers were then shown a lineup of six men. They were asked to decide if the mugger was in the lineup and, if so, to tell which one he was. In effect, then, they had seven choices. The suspect was either one of the six or he wasn't even in the lineup. Of the 2,145 people who called up to respond, 1,843 were wrong. That means about one in seven was right.

Venezuelan prosecutors dropped the most serious charges against opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez, whom the country's government blames for inciting clashes that have left at least five people dead. Lopez, one of the leading opposition figures in Venezuela, was formally charged with arson and conspiracy, but murder and terrorism charges were dropped, said his attorney, Juan Carlos Gutierrez. If convicted, Lopez could face up to 10 years in prison. Lopez's legal team welcomed the reduced charges, though it criticized the way the judicial process was being carried out. Wednesday night's hearing, to charge Lopez and determine whether he would be released or remain behind bars, took place in an unusual spot: a bus parked outside the prison where he is being held. \\"It seems very unorthodox,\\" Gutierrez told CNN en Español. The initial court appearance was to take place in a courtroom, but because of security concerns, officials wanted to move it to the prison. Gutierrez argued that inside a prison was not a proper venue for a hearing, so the strange solution was reached: the bus-turned-courtroom parked just outside the facility. The prison, outside the capital, Caracas, is a military facility, and Lopez's defense has raised questions about why a civilian is being held there. The response was that it was a place where the government could guarantee his safety, Gutierrez said. Lopez turned himself in to authorities this week in a dramatic scene before tens of thousands of supporters he had called to the streets. Anti-government protests in recent weeks are the largest demonstrations that President Nicolas Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power. The unrest. During the demonstrations, supporters of the country's socialist government and anti-government protesters have flooded social media with reports of violence, making drastically different claims about who's behind it. Since February 13, more than 2,000 stories from Venezuela have been uploaded to iReport, CNN's user-generated platform. Many of the videos and photos depict violent scenes between demonstrators and government forces. Alejandro Camacho Beomont told iReport that students Wednesday blocked streets and burned debris in San Cristobal, from where he sent photos -- and he said he didn't blame them. \\"Even though I am always looking for peace to make a better place to live, I think people have the right to express themselves in the ways they can, and it is not easy to express yourself in this country now,\\" he said. \\"I support the protesters. There have been more than 15 years that the majority of the Venezuelan citizens are going through tough times. There are so many problems we have to face every day, and there seems to be not a sincere attitude from the high government officials to rectify (them).\\" In a nationally televised broadcast Wednesday night, Maduro described bullet wounds sustained by government forces during protests and showed videos that he said depicted opposition protesters throwing stones and setting buses ablaze. \\"You think this is a novel? This is the reality that you with your hatred have created,\\" he said. \\"If you don't like Venezuela, leave.\\" Reports of violence drew condemnation from Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition politician who lost a bid for the presidency last year. He called for the government to open a dialogue with demonstrators, rather than cracking down on dissent. \\"In this hour of turbulence, to the students, to those who are in the streets, again we call for you not to step into the trap of violence,\\" he said. Human rights concerns. Human rights groups warned about the danger of turning the protests into a persecution of political opponents. The charges against Lopez, who has organized protests demanding better security, an end to shortages and protected freedom of speech, \\"smack of a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the country,\\" Amnesty International said in a prepared statement. Human Rights Watch warned that Venezuela must avoid \\"scapegoating\\" political opponents. Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said Thursday that out of about 200 people who were detained during clashes in the past week, only 13 remain in jail for offenses that include illegal gun possession and vandalism. Rodriguez Torres ridiculed reports that the Venezuelan state is illegally detaining students in an effort to put an end to the protests. Obama decries 'false accusations' Major social and economic problems in Venezuela have fueled the protests. But as the demonstrations gained steam, officials have pointed fingers at other factors, accusing the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. Venezuela expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government. At a rally Tuesday, Maduro shouted, \\"Yankee, go home\\" from the stage, drawing cheers from the crowd. U.S. President Barack Obama fired back at a news conference in Mexico on Wednesday. \\"Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,\\" he told reporters. In a television broadcast Wednesday, Maduro accused Colombian paramilitary forces and the United States of fueling the violence, and he vowed to stand firm against any attempts to overthrow his government. \\"And what is the Venezuelan opposition going to do?\\" he said. \\"Believe that with the support of (U.S. Secretary of State) John Kerry or Obama, you are going to be able to take political power by violent means?\\" This isn't the first time that bitter protests and counterprotests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Many of Maduro's claims -- of U.S. intervention, of assassination plots -- were also lobbed by the late President Hugo Chavez. Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in 2002, but otherwise outlasted the protests and repeatedly won reelection. He ruled for 14 years, until his death last year after a long battle with cancer.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Answer: Answer:","completion":"There is no specific duration mentioned in the context for how long a mud mask or facial mask needs to be applied for sun-damaged skin. However, generally speaking, mud or facial masks usually need to be applied for approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the mask's instructions and the individual's skin type. It is crucial to follow the product's guidelines and remove the mask when recommended to avoid over-drying or irritating the skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The R-rated superhero movie, featuring Ryan Reynolds as Marvel's foul-mouthed, irreverent Deadpool, set a slew of new records: the biggest R-rated opening (beating 2003's The Matrix Reloaded, which opened with 91.8 million), the biggest February weekend and biggest President's Day four-day weekend (beating 2015's Fifty Shades of Grey,with 85.2 million for the former and 93 million for the latter). Deadpool is expected to take an overwhelming 150 million over the full four-day holiday weekend.

Deadpool was a hit on every level, scoring 84% critical approval on review aggregate site RottenTomatoes.com and an A from audiences on CinemaScore.

Second place for the weekend went to Jack Black's family-friendly animated Kung Fu Panda 3,which made 19.7 million (93.9 million total after three weeks of release). Panda 3 is projected to pass the 100 million mark at the end of the four-day weekend. How to Be Single took third with 18.8 million.

Context: Svinhufvud's Senate introduced Finland's Declaration of Independence on 4 December 1917 and Parliament adopted it on 6 December. The social democrats voted against the Senate's proposal, while presenting an alternative declaration of sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a guaranteed conclusion for the small Finnish nation. Recognition by Russia and other great powers was essential; Svinhufvud accepted that he had to negotiate with Lenin for the acknowledgement. The socialists, having been reluctant to enter talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to request that Lenin approve Finnish sovereignty. In December 1917, Lenin was under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk and the Bolsheviks' rule was in crisis, with an inexperienced administration and the demoralised army facing powerful political and military opponents. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud's delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917. By the beginning of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognised Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they waited and monitored the relations between Finland and Germany , hoping to override Lenin's regime and to get Russia back into the war against the German Empire. In turn, the Germans hastened Finland's separation from Russia so as to move the country to within their sphere of influence.

Établie en 1948 et active jusqu'en 2011, l'UEO était une organisation de coopération en matière de défense et de sécurité entre les nations européennes. Au fil des années, l'UEO a contribué à la mise en place des structures nécessaires pour garantir la sécurité et la stabilité de la région. L'organisation a soutenu des projets tels que la mise en place d'une armée européenne, la création d'une force de réaction rapide et la mise en place de mesures de coopération en matière de défense. Ces projets ont été développés en étroite collaboration avec d'autres institutions et organisations européennes, comme l'Union européenne (UE), l'Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN) et l'Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe (OSCE). En outre, l'UEO a travaillé à la création d'un espace de dialogue entre les États membres afin de promouvoir la compréhension et la coopération en matière de défense et de sécurité. Par l'intermédiaire de diverses initiatives, l'organisation a encouragé les États membres à partager leurs connaissances et leur expertise en matière de défense, et à mettre en place des mécanismes pour soutenir une politique de défense européenne. L'implication de l'UEO dans la construction d'une défense européenne au sein de l'Union a finalement conduit à la création d'une politique européenne de sécurité et de défense (PESD), qui est aujourd'hui une composante essentielle de l'Union européenne. La PESD, qui a été renommée Politique de sécurité et de défense commune (PSDC) en 2009, constitue un cadre pour la coopération entre les États membres de l'UE en matière de défense et de sécurité. Dans le cadre de la PSDC, les États membres travaillent ensemble pour élaborer et mettre en œuvre des missions et des opérations en matière de sécurité et de défense, dans le but de préserver la paix, de prévenir les conflits et de renforcer la sécurité internationale. Bien que l'UEO ait été officiellement dissoute en 2011, son héritage et son engagement envers la création d'une défense européenne au sein de l'Union restent vivants à travers la PSDC et les efforts continus des États membres de l'UE pour renforcer leur coopération en matière de défense et de sécurité."},{"prompt":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of nitrates? Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

The 39-year-old has been receiving treatment for an ankle injury he sustained during his time at Turkish club Gaziantep, from which he departed last week, but will not be remaining with the Magpies. Ankle Injury and Treatment: Ameobi suffered the injury during his tenure at his most recent club, Gaziantep. The Nigerian forward turned down several opportunities to renew his contract to focus on finding new challenges in his career and eventually landed back at St. James' Park training base in Newcastle, where he was rehabilitating. Newcastle United caretaker boss John Carver, however, made it clear that Ameobi would not be rejoining the club. Looking Towards Major League Soccer: Instead, the experienced attacker is reportedly considering a move to Major League Soccer in America, amidst increasing interest in the league. If Ameobi follows through, he would join a growing list of high-profile players who have recently moved to the U.S. competition, seeking new challenges and opportunities in the latter years of their careers. Steven Gerrard Precedent: Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard stands as one such example, having made a high-profile move to LA Galaxy in 2015. The former England international played two seasons with the Galaxy, acting as an influential figure both on and off the pitch before retiring from professional football. Ameobi could similarly use this opportunity to bring his wealth of experience and footballing expertise to the Major League Soccer scene. In summary, although Shola Ameobi has been receiving treatment at Newcastle United's training ground after leaving Gaziantep, he will not be re-signing with the Magpies. Instead, the former striker is said to be mulling over a move to Major League Soccer, amongst a growing trend of football veterans seeking new challenges across the pond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

Harvest your larvae weekly. Dispose of dead larvae.","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Raising Fish Larvae in Aquaria Introduction Raising fish larvae, also known as 'wrigglers', within home aquaria can be a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience. This article will provide a comprehensive guide, detailing everything you need to know about catching, transferring, harvesting, and maintaining the health of fish larvae in your tank. Catching the Fish Larvae: A Delicate Task The first step in raising fish larvae is, of course, catching them. Regardless of the breed of the fish, larvae are unfailingly delicate creatures. One can use an eye dropper or a small fish net for this purpose. Both options offer restorative control while being gentle enough to ensure the larvae's safety. The eye dropper technique involves creating a suction effect to carefully 'pick up' the larvae, without any direct contact. On the other hand, using a small net requires more skill, but can facilitate the collection of larger quantities of larvae at a time. Remember, the key is to handle them with extreme care to avoid any harm. Preparing the Safe Haven: Placement of Unhatched Egg Boats Introduction of the unhatched egg boats into the fish tank is an essential step to create a conducive incubatory environment for the unhatched eggs. These egg boats are artificial spawning sites designed to resemble a fish's natural habitat. They provide a protective shield for the unhatched eggs, preventing other inhabitants of the tank from preying on them. Monitor their progress daily to ensure they are safe and developing correctly. Welcome Your New Inhabitants: Transferring the Wrigglers After successful collection, it is time to introduce the larvae 'wrigglers' to the fish tank. Ensure that the tank's conditions are optimized for their survival and growth, including appropriate temperature, pH, and light exposure. Frequent Monitoring: Weekly Harvesting of Larvae Maintaining the health, growth, and safety of your newly added residents is crucial in their upbringing. Regular harvesting through gentle suction or netting allows you to monitor and assess their growth progressive accurately. A weekly schedule is recommended as it is frequent enough to detect any abnormalities promptly, yet not so invasive as to cause the larvae undue stress. Dealing with Mortality: Disposal of Dead Larvae In the lifecycle of fish larvae, facing mortality is not uncommon – in fact, it's natural. These natural losses can, however, have detrimental effects on the health of other fish and larvae in the tank if not properly managed. Dead larvae tend to deteriorate quickly, leading to unsanitary conditions that can endanger all the tank's inhabitants. Regular removal of dead larvae, therefore, helps maintain both the health of the tank and the wellbeing of its other inhabitants. Conclusion Raising fish larvae might seem like an overwhelming task at first, but with patience, care, and the right techniques, it can be a fascinating journey. The careful process of collecting, introducing, observing, and caring for these delicate creatures offers not just an opportunity to enrich your aquatic understanding but also an extraordinary joy of adding and nurturing life in your home aquaria environment. Be mindful as the margin of error is slim. But with this guide in your hands, each step will bring you one inch closer to a vibrant and thriving aquatic family!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: William James Dixon (July 1, 1915 - January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Context: Dixon signed with Chess Records as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, talent scout, session musician and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for Cobra Records, for which he produced early singles for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. He later recorded for Bluesville Records. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, Yambo Records, and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, Peace?, on Yambo and also singles by McKinley Mitchell, Lucky Peterson and others. Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues. He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, Jimmy Rogers, Sam Lay and others. In December 1964, the Rolling Stones reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\". In the same year, the group also covered \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" on their debut album, The Rolling Stones. Question: In what way did he work with them? Answer:","completion":"William James Dixon worked with various artists in multiple capacities. As a producer, talent scout, session musician, and staff songwriter for Chess Records and Checker Records, he helped shape and develop the careers of many Chicago blues musicians, including Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, and Sonny Boy Williamson. Dixon wrote numerous songs that were recorded by these artists, and he also played the upright bass and guitar during recording sessions, adding his musical skills to their tracks. Additionally, he collaborated with these artists during live performances, further cementing their partnership in creating the unique sound of the Chicago blues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Bowie's last three songs: decoding the final transmission “I’ve got a handful of songs to sing / To sting your soul, to fuck you over,” sings David Bowie on Killing a Little Time, one of three new songs on the album of his stage musical Lazarus. Now there’s a lyric to conjure with. It’s so playfully, poignantly appropriate for one of Bowie’s very last recordings that it’s hard to resist the idea that he is addressing us directly; that it’s a morbid showbusiness flourish from a dying man. But is that all there is to a Bowie song? Bowie was never one for straightforward autobiography. His lyrics, even from a song as beloved as Life on Mars?, contain confounding twists and pockets of mystery. You can have a lot of fun guessing what they mean but you can never fully explain them. Before he died in January, Blackstar seemed to be yet another of his slippery, enigmatic creations, so it felt a little disappointing to see its array of possible meanings reduced, upon his passing, to a deathbed address. Confirmation bias led listeners to literalise any line that was remotely death-related and downplay the rest. The theory that this was a calculated farewell was alluring and not without foundation but it was suspiciously neat, given what we know about his art. The Lazarus material really is the last word. Here are the final three songs recorded by a titanic artist whose death triggered a volcano of grief, so how could we not comb them for clues? But they are also components of a long-dreamt-of musical about Thomas Jerome Newton, The Man Who Fell to Earth. Of course, Bowie seemed to mindmeld with Walter Tevis’s creation at one psychologically fraught point in the mid-70s – the covers for Station to Station and Low both used stills from Nicolas Roeg’s movie; cocaine has a way of making one identify with an emotionally numb alien far from home – but still, there was, and is, a difference between the singer and the character. These songs were written for actors to sing, so interpret with caution. They are by no means offcuts. Posthumous material often resembles a scrawny cigarette, scraped together using strands of tobacco from the butts in the ashtray. But these songs are as fully realised as anything on Blackstar. Indeed, they were recorded at the same time, with the same band and producer, and give the same impression that Bowie was on one last hot streak. Each one has its own flavour. When I Met You is the kind of briskly anthemic, self-quoting rock that Bowie delivered on his 2013 comeback album The Next Day, climbing a ladder of chords to a stirring chorus, until a swarm of overlapping backing vocals knocks it sideways, giving it a stranger, more chaotic quality. Killing a Little Time has the same neurotic momentum as Sue (Or in a Season of Crime) and a touch of Outside’s 1990s industrial clamour, pitching Bowie’s sinisterly theatrical vocal into shrieking, churning jazz-rock. Mark Guiliana’s astonishing, tentacular drumming alone confirms that Bowie’s last band, led by saxophonist Donny McCaslin, was one of his best, capable of anything. Bowie sounds like a man coming apart — “I’m falling, man / I’m choking, man / I’m fading, man” — but it feels like Newton talking. Bowie is just the cracked actor. The best of the three, No Plan, is also the one most likely to inspire literal readings. It’s an exquisitely lush, star-speckled torch song, which refracts the late-in-life stocktaking of Piaf or Sinatra through the stasis and fatalism of Talking Heads’ Heaven. “All the things that are my life / All my moves, my beliefs, my designs / Me alone, nothing to regret / This is no place but here I am / This is not quite yet,” Bowie croons. Taken alone, it would be a hell of a swansong (“Am I nowhere now?”) but play it beside the feverish discontent of Killing a Little Time and it loses its soothing finality. Again, these are numbers from a musical. They might feel movingly true at times but they’re stories, from a master storyteller. For a fan, these three songs reignite that January sadness, but they also underline what Blackstar implied, which is that Bowie wasn’t winding down but racing as fast as his health allowed through a final burst of creativity that was cut short too soon. And they provide a more ambiguous finale to a consistently surprising career. If you retrospectively found closure in Blackstar, then you’ll discover a more open ending here: loose threads to unravel that suspicious neatness. Their artistic vitality will, as promised, sting your soul. It will fuck you over.

Choose from: [i] make Skylar happy with a gift; [ii] give the gift to her mom; [iii] look for a nice box for the gift; Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Jesse has already shopped for the best gift for his boyfriend Skylar. Therefore, Jesse would most likely want to take the necessary steps to ensure that the gift looks attractive, is presented well, and, ultimately, is successful in making Skylar happy. To achieve these goals, Jesse will be inclined to first choose option [iii]: look for a nice box for the gift. Putting the gift in a box will enhance its appearance and also create an element of surprise. It will show that Jesse has put thought and effort into his gift, emphasizing Skylar's importance to him. Once Jesse has found the perfect box, he will need to make sure the gift, in its new packaging, embodies his message – love, care, and the appreciation he has for Skylar. This will involve selecting a beautiful wrapping paper that complements the gift and reflects Skylar's personality or their shared memories and experiences. Additionally, Jesse might want to choose a meaningful or heartwarming card to accompany the gift. In the card, he can write a personal message expressing his feelings and describing why this particular gift was chosen especially for Skylar. Upon completing these tasks, Jesse can now move on to option [i]: make Skylar happy with the gift. At this point, Jesse will want to choose the perfect moment to present the gift to Skylar. This moment should be personal, intimate, and free from distractions, ensuring that both Jesse and Skylar can fully absorb the sentiment behind the exchange. Alternatively, Jesse might opt to surprise Skylar with the gift. He could do this by leaving the beautifully wrapped gift and card in a strategic location, where Skylar is certain to find it, such as on Skylar's bed or desk. This surprise element might further serve to heighten the excitement and happiness that Skylar experiences upon receiving the special gift. In conclusion, after shopping for the best gift for his boyfriend Skylar, Jesse would plausibly look for a nice box for the gift, wrap it elegantly, include a heartfelt message, and then present or surprise Skylar in an unforgettable manner. By taking the time and effort to make this gesture meaningful and special, Jesse will undoubtedly succeed in making Skylar happy with the gift."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nick needed a splint on their arm but not Michael because Pick your answer from: (A). Nick had a healthy arm.. (B). Michael had a healthy arm..","completion":"B. Michael had a healthy arm. Nick needed a splint on their arm but not Michael because Michael had a healthy arm. As they were in the woods with limited resources, Nick knew that they had to improvise. Step 1: Identify materials to create a splint Nick scanned the surroundings for two sturdy sticks that could be secured to the injured arm. These sticks would provide enough support for the injured area, ensuring that the arm stays properly aligned as they made their way back to civilization. Step 2: Gather additional materials for securing the splint Next, Nick searched for materials to use to secure the sticks in place on the arm. This could include strips of cloth from their clothing, flexible vines, or even shoelaces. The key was to find materials strong enough to hold the splint in place without causing discomfort or cutting off circulation. Step 3: Position the injured arm Before applying the splint, Nick needed to ensure that the injured arm was in a straight position, with the hand slightly elevated to prevent swelling. Gently, Nick guided the arm into this position while being mindful of the pain and discomfort. Step 4: Apply the splint Once the arm was properly positioned, Nick placed the two sturdy sticks on either side of the arm and began tying the materials securely around the sticks and the injured limb. Maintaining even pressure and spacing the ties every few inches along the arm, Nick ensured that the splint was firmly stabilized. Step 5: Reassess and adjust if necessary Upon completion, Nick assessed the stability of the splint, verifying that it was securing the injured arm effectively and offering enough support. If any adjustments were needed, Nick made them accordingly, ensuring that the splint provided both comfort and immobilization. Step 6: Seek medical attention Now that the arm was immobilized using the splint, their immediate priority was to seek professional medical assistance. Nick and Michael identified the direction they needed to travel to reach the nearest town and began their journey, being cautious of further injury to the splinted arm. By acting efficiently and effectively, Nick was able to create a makeshift splint that protected their injured arm while they sought medical attention. Meanwhile, Michael was there to offer emotional and physical support, as his healthy arm allowed him to take on more tasks during their trek."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the thing or person that may be immune to the venom of the Lycosa Carnivora? ? Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a .22 rifle. However Holmes manages to escape, and Lestrade and the police arrest Spedding, her gang, and the pygmy.

You are given two options and you need to select the one that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. Indicate your answer by 'Option 1' if the first option is correct, otherwise 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story.

Sentence 3: I lifted half of what my friend did, and I almost dropped the weight Sentence 4: When we moved to the leg exercises, I quit from exhaustion Sentence 5: I went into the locker room and packed up my bag for home Option 1: We started our workout on the bench press. Option 2: We started our workout on the treadmill.","completion":"This task wants you to fill in the missing second sentence in a five sentence story. Both options given to you will fit in the structure of the story, but only one will maintain consistency within the story's narrative. It's important to remember that the incorrect option will disrupt the sequence of events, making one or more of the following sentences seem out of place or not make sense. Taking a look at sentences 3 and 4, we can see they refer to specific gym exercises - lifting weights and leg exercises. This should be a hint to which option fits best. Option 1: \\"We started our workout on the bench press.\\" This option refers to a gym activity and serves as a natural way to transition to sentence 3, which speaks about lifting weight. Option 2: \\"We started our workout on the treadmill.\\" While it is a gym activity, this option shifts the focus of the story to cardio exercises, which disconnects from sentence 3 about lifting weights. Thus, 'Option 1' is the correct choice here. It connects seamlessly with the third sentence, allowing the story to flow naturally without changing any subsequent elements in the narrative. The selection of 'Option 2' would interrupt the storyline as it does not align with the reference to weight lifting in sentence 3, causing a disruption in the consistency of the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

Which language is this?","completion":"The given text is in Turkish. Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. This language family is one of the world’s major language families, and its languages are spoken by some 170 to 200 million people spread across a wide area from Northeastern Siberia in the east to the Balkan Peninsula in the west. Turkey, where Turkish is primarily spoken, has strong historical, cultural, and political ties to the Turkic peoples of Central Asia. The modern Turkish language derives from the Ottoman Turkish language which was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian. However, the Turkish Language Reform in the early 20th century purged the language of a great many Arabic and Persian loanwords, replacing them with newly coined Turkish words. The Latin alphabet is used for writing Turkish since 1928, replacing the Arabic script. The provided text can be translated roughly into English as: \\"Some analysts believe that dialogue mechanisms will overcome the existing regional bilateral disputes and facilitate the EU membership of the candidates.\\" This phrase likely refers to discussions about potential new members of the European Union, such as talks about Turkey's longstanding bid for EU membership. One of the notable features of the Turkish language is its use of vowel harmony, a type of phonological process that involves the changing of vowel sounds that are dependent upon the preceding vowel or consonant. Turkish also follows a subject-object-verb word order, rather than the subject-verb-object order that is common in English. For example, \\"I see you\\" would be \\"Ben seni görüyorum\\" in Turkish, which translates directly to \\"I you see\\". Additionally, Turkish is highly agglutinative, meaning words are often made up of multiple parts — root words and one or more affixes. For example, the word \\"çıkarılamayabileceğinizi\\" means \\"that you might not be able to be taken out,\\" showcasing the complexity of the language. While Turkish is the official and main language of Turkey, it is also spoken by Turkish communities in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, and other regions of the Balkans as well as by large immigrant communities in Western Europe and in North America."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Labour was challenged to hand back donations from the Unite union yesterday after its leader called for civil disobedience during the Olympics. General secretary ‘Red Len’ McCluskey threatened illegal strikes and direct action to oppose changes to public sector pensions. Labour leader Ed Miliband joined the Trades Union Congress in denouncing Mr McCluskey’s outburst – but only after he had tweeted a mild rebuke earlier in the day. Clash: Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, was put on the defencive by David Cameron, right, over his party's links to Unite. Mr Miliband also faced calls to break the link with the union which remains Labour’s biggest donor. In the Commons, David Cameron said:. ‘Let us remember Unite is the single biggest donor to the party. opposite, providing around a third of their money, and had more role. than anybody else in putting the Right Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Miliband) in his place.’ Mr Cameron also attacked Mr Miliband for initially failing to condemn Mr McCluskey’s views in person. On Tuesday night when news of Mr. McCluskey’s views first surfaced, the Labour leader left it to his. spokesman to respond. Then yesterday morning he issued a tweet and sent. his deputy Harriet Harman to answer questions on radio and television. Disruption: 'Red Len' McCluskey threatened a year of industrial strife and said Unite would be prepared to break the law 'to defend our basic rights' But Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s not good. enough for them just to put out a tweet, they need to condemn this. utterly and start turning back the money.’ Downing Street earlier denounced the threat of strikes to disrupt the Olympics as ‘completely unacceptable and unpatriotic’. Rebuke: Nick Clegg said the public would be 'gobsmacked' and 'appalled' by Mr McCluskey's comments. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Mr Miliband to ‘rein in’ the union boss. ‘I just think people will be. gobsmacked, appalled, that someone thinks that at a time when we are. finally hosting one of the greatest events in the world, he is calling. for civil disobedience,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘I know he is the sort of paymaster of the Labour party but I hope Ed Miliband will rein him in.’ Stung into action, the Labour leader eventually broke cover to speak out as he met French Socialist leader Francoise Hollande. Mr Miliband said: ‘It’s completely. wrong to make any threat to the Olympic Games – I do condemn it. We as. the Labour government fought for the Olympic Games to be brought to. Britain as part of a cross-party effort – it is a moment of national. celebration. ‘The focus of the world will be on. Britain and it is totally wrong to make a threat to the Games.’ Since. the general election Unite has given £5million to Labour, making it by. far the party’s biggest donor. 'Chaos': Mr McCluskey said action during the Olympics would bring his 'grievances to the attention of as many people as possible' Countdown: The Olympic rings mounted on a barge pass under Tower Bridge as London counts down to the games. Mr McCluskey said no precise plans had. been drawn up for action during the games, but added that they. ‘absolutely’ could include strikes. Pugh's take. ‘The attacks that are being launched. on public sector workers at the moment are so deep and ideological that. the idea the world should arrive in London and have these wonderful. Olympic Games as though everything is nice and rosy in the garden is. unthinkable. Our very way of life is being attacked,’ he said. Labour MPs were also furious last night with Mr McCluskey. ‘This is just posturing but it doesn’t do us any good,’ said one. ‘This sort of thing is unpopular with. the public and damages by association. Ed needs to take a stand and show. that he’s not Unite’s man.’ TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: ‘The TUC and Britain’s unions have been strong supporters of the London Olympics. Unions have engaged constructively. with the Olympic authorities throughout the whole project to ensure the. good working conditions that are helping deliver the Games on time and. on budget.’ VIDEO: Shadow Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell gives her opinion on Len McCluskey's comments.

Article: The mystery woman sitting on a Powerball ticket worth 560 million has petitioned a New Hampshire court to let her claim the jackpot before a judgment is reached on whether her name must be made public – in part, her lawyers argue, so she can start lining up private security. A hearing on her fight to collect on her winnings anonymously is scheduled for today in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua, N.H. Lawyers for \\"Jane Doe\\" filed a motion yesterday asking the court to let her claim the third largest Powerball jackpot in history through a trust, \\"pending a final resolution of this matter.\\" She is agreeing, as part of the claim process, to have a trustee provide her photo identification and Social Security number to the New Hampshire Lottery Commission on the condition that all her personal information be kept confidential. A lump-sum cash payout is worth 352 million, the lawyers note in their court filing. The woman struck gold on Jan. 6 with the Easy Pick combination of 12-29-30-33-61 and Powerball number 26. The ticket was purchased at Reeds Ferry Market in Merrimack, N.H. \\"Allowing Ms. Doe to collect payment of the Powerball prize will provide Ms. Doe with the time and resources to adequately prepare for the possibility that the Court will hold that the Commission must disclose her identity in response to a Right to Know request,\\" the attorneys tell the court. \\"With her prize winnings, Ms. Doe will be able to obtain the necessary security to ensure her and her family's safety and take other protective actions in order to mitigate acts of harassment and annoyance.\\" The woman signed the back of the Powerball ticket with her name, home address and phone number after turning to the New Hampshire Lottery Commission's website for advice on how to claim her prize — only belatedly realizing she could have set up a trust to protect her identity. The commission has seen a copy of ticket and confirmed \\"it is likely the winning ticket,\\" its lawyers acknowledge in their motion to dismiss Jane Doe's argument for remaining anonymous. The ticket will have to be submitted as signed with the winner's signature and personal information, the commission states. \\"Even if the winner elects to assign the ticket to another legal entity, such as a trust, the ticket itself will need to be submitted in its original form,\\" the commission told the court. \\"Whiting out, reconstruction, tampering or other alteration of the ticket violates Powerball Administrative Rules and could lead to a disqualification of the ticket.\\" The winning ticket, when presented to the commission, will be considered a public document, the commission's lawyers note. Under New Hampshire's Right-to-Know law, most public documents must be released upon appropriate request, and the commission would be legally obligated to release the winning ticket with, at a minimum, the winner's name and hometown, it states. ||||| The commission oversees hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues and prizes a year. “When somebody wins a public lottery of 560 million, there is a public interest in knowing who the winner was, and that it is a fair and equitable process,” John J. Conforti, an assistant attorney general representing the lottery commission, told the court. The state gave little credence to the argument that identifying Ms. Doe would jeopardize her safety, saying that any risk could be managed by engaging a security detail. Ms. Doe’s lawyers said they were already lining up bodyguards. Most states view the names of winners of significant prizes as a matter of public record, though a few permit winners to keep their identities private. Some states, including New Hampshire, allow trusts and not just individuals to claim winnings. For almost two hours Tuesday, Judge Charles Temple of the Hillsborough County Superior Court heard arguments in the case, which has made headlines around the world for the eye-popping size of the prize and for an “if only” twist in Ms. Doe’s plight. When Ms. Doe realized she had the winning ticket, she followed the instructions on the ticket and on the lottery commission’s website to “sign the ticket.” If only she had talked to a lawyer first, she might have avoided the entire issue. She could have set up a trust that would sign the ticket, claim the prize and be the public face of the winner, rather than Ms. Doe personally. But lottery officials say the chance to do that ended when she signed her name. Ms. Doe’s lawyers — Steven M. Gordon and Billy Shaheen, high-powered attorneys in the state — said the ticket and state’s website were misleading because they did not explain that by signing a ticket, winners give up their anonymity. Nowhere, they said, does the website advise the winner “that there is an option for a trust to claim a prize.” |||||Summary:","completion":"A New Hampshire woman, known as \\"Jane Doe,\\" is fighting to claim her 560 million Powerball jackpot prize without disclosing her identity, citing personal security concerns. After winning the large sum in the lottery, she signed the back of her ticket with her name, address, and phone number. The woman later discovered that she could have set up a trust to protect her identity. A hearing is scheduled for today in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua, New Hampshire, where the court will consider allowing her to claim the prize through a trust, with her personal information remaining confidential. Most states view the lottery winner's name as public record, and the New Hampshire Lottery Commission argues that disclosure is necessary to ensure the process is \\"fair and equitable.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve -14*y + 259 - 175 = 0 for y.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this step by step: 1. We have the equation -14*y + 259 - 175 = 0 2. First, we will combine the numbers 259 and -175. So, 259 - 175 = 84 Now our equation is -14*y + 84 = 0 3. Next, we want to get y by itself. So let's move the 84 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 84 from both sides: -14*y + 84 - 84 = 0 - 84 Now we have: -14*y = -84 4. Finally, we want to find out what y is. Since y is being multiplied by -14, we need to divide both sides by -14 to find y: y = -84 / -14 5. Divide -84 by -14 and we get y = 6 So the answer is y = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement.

In the post WWII era, several eastern European countries came into the orbit of the Soviet Union.","completion":"In both sentences, the term \\"orbit\\" is used to convey a similar concept, but the context slightly differs. Here is a closer examination of each sentence to understand the nuances involved. 1. \\"In the political orbit of a world power.\\" In this sentence, the term \\"orbit\\" is used metaphorically to suggest that a country or entity is under the influence and control of a world power. It implies that this entity is subjected to the political direction and decisions made by the more powerful world power, in a relationship akin to a satellite and the celestial body it orbits. 2. \\"In the post WWII era, several eastern European countries came into the orbit of the Soviet Union.\\" In this context, \\"orbit\\" still denotes influence and control but is being used in a historical context to describe the situation that unfolded following World War II. In this case, the term describes the fact that many Eastern European countries fell under the political and economic control of the Soviet Union, which acted as the dominant regional power. In both sentences, \\"orbit\\" essentially conveys the dependency of a smaller entity (e.g., a country) on a larger and more powerful entity (e.g., a world power or the Soviet Union). While the contexts are different – one being a general description of political influence, and the other being specific to the post-WWII era – the term \\"orbit\\" serves a similar purpose in conveying the metaphorical relationship between the influential power and the dependent entity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average literacy stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, functional illiteracy is significant. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level.

The change was originally published on January 6, 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta).

Many young people become discouraged when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change. Question: The purpose for the writer to write the passage is to _ . Options: A: train you to be perfect B: show you the way to be happy C: tell you how to act when you dislike a person D: teach you how to be popular among your friends The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: show you the way to be happy"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Surely, you have noticed the tall poles along the roadside. Do you know what is on top of those poles? Thats right, wires that carry electric current. These wires carry electric current to your home. But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where are the wires that carry electric current to your home?\\" is \\"Under the poles\\"?","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where are the wires that carry electric current to your home?\\" is \\"On top of the poles\\" instead of \\"Under the poles.\\" The paragraph states, \\"You have noticed the tall poles along the roadside... wires that carry electric current.

We have the equation: 0 = -5*s - 7*s + 771 - 711 First, we can combine the numbers which are not attached to 's' (those are the ones at the end, 771 and -711): 771 - 711 = 60 Now our equation looks like: 0 = -5*s - 7*s + 60 Next, let's add the parts with 's' together (it's like saying \\"I have -5 apples and -7 apples\\"): -5*s - 7*s = -12*s Now our equation looks like: 0 = -12*s + 60 To solve for 's', we want to move the 12*s to the other side of the equation. We will do that by adding 12*s to both sides: 0 + 12*s = 60 This simplifies to: 12*s = 60 Now, we just need to find out how many times 12 can fit into 60. If we divide both sides by 12, we can find the answer: s = 60 / 12 And when you do the division, you get: s = 5 So the answer is: s = 5"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 1956 Walton sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia. He built a hilltop house at Forio and called it La Mortella. Susana Walton created a magnificent garden there. Walton's other works of the 1950s include the music for a fourth Shakespeare film, Olivier's Richard III, and the Cello Concerto (1956), written for Gregor Piatigorsky, who gave the premiere in January 1957 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the conductor Charles Munch. Some critics felt that the concerto was old-fashioned; Peter Heyworth wrote that there was little in the work that would have startled an audience in the year the Titanic met its iceberg (1912). It has nevertheless entered the regular repertoire, performed by Paul Tortelier, Yo-Yo Ma, Lynn Harrell and Pierre Fournier among others. In 1966 Walton successfully underwent surgery for lung cancer. Until then he had been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, The Bear, which was premiered at Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so used to being written off by music critics that he felt \\"there must be something wrong when the worms turned on some praise.\\" Walton received the Order of Merit in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.Walton's orchestral works of the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). His song cycles from this period were composed for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin.

Positive Movie Review: Title: Interstellar (2014) Director: Christopher Nolan Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is an ambitious sci-fi epic that manages to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit. Set against the backdrop of a future Earth struggling with drought, famine, and the imminent extinction of humanity, the film follows former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) as he leads a group of scientists on a mission to find a habitable planet in a distant galaxy. One of the highlights of Interstellar is its stunning visuals. The film’s outer space settings are breathtaking, with meticulously designed shots of planets, black holes, and wormholes that are both beautiful and scientifically accurate. Equally impressive are the sets on Earth which depict a gritty, dust-choked world on the brink of collapse. Nolan's storytelling is a significant aspect of the film’s success, as it poses thought-provoking questions about our place in the universe and the nature of time. Furthermore, its non-linear storytelling structure adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, leaving the audience pondering the intricacies of the story long after the credits roll. The performances in Interstellar are equally commendable. Matthew McConaughey delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as Cooper, a father who must face the agonizing choice between saving his family and the entire human race. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain offer strong supporting performances, adding depth and emotion to their respective roles. The entire cast works well together, creating a believable dynamic between the characters that further grounds the story in reality. Hans Zimmer's haunting and emotional score perfectly complements the film's visuals and emotional core. His use of traditional orchestral elements combined with innovative electronic sounds gives Interstellar a unique and mesmerizing sonic identity that further enhances the overall experience. In conclusion, Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally rich, and thought-provoking sci-fi epic that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. Bolstered by exceptional performances and a captivating story, it's a testament to Christopher Nolan's prowess as both a director and storyteller. Interstellar is a must-watch for fans of science fiction and great cinema in general."},{"prompt":"How long ago was it…? It was a long time is all I know.

I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good. The following days we went to Austrian Castle, Ice Cave, and more buildings and such. The trip overall made this birthday the most memorable and the best thus far.

Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate of Dorje's reincarnation within a boy named Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger) in Seattle. While Jesse is fascinated with the monks and their way of life, his parents, Dean (Chris Isaak) and Lisa (Bridget Fonda), are wary, and that wariness turns into near-hostility when Norbu announces that he would like to take Jesse back with him to Bhutan to be tested. Jesse's father changes his mind however, after one of his close friends and colleagues commits suicide, seeming to realize that there could be more to life than work and money. He then decides to go to Bhutan with his son. In Nepal, two children who are also candidates are encountered, Raju (Rajuh Lal) and Gita (Greishma Makar Singh).In the story, the Lama Norbu relates Buddha's life story from a book entitled \\"Little Buddha,\\" which is also enacted as a story within the movie. In the story, a Hindu prince called Siddhartha sets on a journey to achieve his goal. Mara, a jealous demon, senses that Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves) is about to attain enlightenment and sends his daughters to distract him. Failing to do so, he attempts to shatter Siddharthas resolve and thus begins an onslaught of threats, intimidation and temptation. Mara summons a terrifying horde of monsters of every conceivable description but even something as horrific as this still leaves Siddhartha unmoved, unperturbed. Instead he transforms the weapons which these hosts throw at him into lotus petals which exude a lovely fragrance as they gently floated down to earth.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the question: Process: - A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together - The solid nest supports the eggs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more leaves are added to the nest happens, how will it affect more leaves will stick together. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of adding more leaves to the nest has an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process of nest-building. Step-by-step justification: 1. Adding more leaves to the nest directly affects the composition of the nest. In this case, the nest will have a higher proportion of leaves compared to other materials like sticks, grass, mud, and spider webs. 2. As more leaves are added, they may stick together due to their natural surface properties and the presence of mud, which acts as an adhesive. This can make the nest denser and potentially stronger, providing better support for the eggs. 3. An indirect effect of adding more leaves is that it may affect the insulation properties of the nest. Leaves can provide extra insulation, helping to keep the eggs warm and protected from temperature fluctuations. 4. More leaves in the nest may also result in a longer time spent constructing the nest, as the bird will need to collect and arrange more materials. This can indirectly affect the bird's energy expenditure and the overall time available for other activities, such as foraging and mating. 5. Another indirect effect of adding more leaves is that it may alter the visual camouflage of the nest. Depending on the tree or location where the nest is built, more leaves could either make the nest less visible to predators or make it stand out more, potentially affecting the safety of the eggs and hatchlings. Based on these factors, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation of adding more leaves to the nest does have direct and indirect effects on the nest-building process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That claim turned out not to be true, leading Rowling to delete her original tweets and apologize, Time and the Telegraph report. Rowling's original tweets (archived here) were based on an edited video of a July 24 press conference in which the young boy appeared to reach out to shake hands and Trump appeared to ignore him. But the full video—as many critics, including Piers Morgan, PolitiFact, and the boy's own mother, pointed out to Rowling—clearly shows Trump leaning down to talk to the boy and paying him quite a bit of attention. \\"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction,\\" Rowling said in a series of tweets Monday. \\"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly. These tweets will remain, but I will delete the previous ones on the subject.\\" Rowling did not address her apology to Trump himself, whom she's called worse than Voldemort. Expand this summary.","completion":"In July 2017, British author JK Rowling found herself amidst a controversy surrounding an edited video clip that allegedly showed President Trump ignoring a young boy in a wheelchair during a press conference on July 24. Rowling, who has been vocal about her opposition to Trump in the past, took to Twitter to call out the President's supposed refusal to shake the boy's hand. The series of tweets from Rowling, which have since been archived, were based on this edited video that appeared to show the child reaching out for a handshake with Trump, while the President seemingly ignored him. However, the reality of the situation was different, as the unedited version of the video, as well as testimonies from multiple sources including Piers Morgan, PolitiFact, and the boy's mother, revealed that President Trump actually leaned down to talk to the boy and paid him quite a bit of attention. Upon realizing her mistake and after facing backlash for her tweets, Rowling issued an apology. She explained in a new series of tweets, \\"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction.\\" Acknowledging her assumptions, Rowling added, \\"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly.\\" In her apology, Rowling stated that she would leave her apology tweets up but would delete the previous ones related to the incorrect claims. It should be noted that Rowling's apology did not directly address President Trump, whom she has strongly criticized in the past, even going as far as comparing him to the fictional villain, Voldemort, from her Harry Potter series. This incident and the subsequent uproar that ensued raised questions about the importance of verifying information before sharing it, especially when it concerns public figures like President Trump. Individuals with large followings, such as JK Rowling, can inadvertently spread misinformation which can lead to divisiveness and misunderstandings. The Rowling-Trump controversy ultimately highlights the essential need for fact-checking, especially in today's fast-paced world of social media and digital content sharing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state, and more soldiers for the Union Army than any other Southern state. Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century.

Is this product review positive? Title: Wanted to LOVE this toy Review: I bought two of these for my 3 year old and 6 year old girls. They look like the cutest things ever, and as a child, I loved helping my mom crack real eggs to cook, so I thought my kids would love these. They are nearly impossible to pry open, even for me. I'm not exaggerating, I'm a very strong person, but can barely get them opened once in a while. Because they are so hard to open, my kids used their mouths, trying to pry them open...the metal bent, the paint scratched off...I ended up throwing the shell part away b/c I was worried about them getting hurt with them. I love the idea, but some tweaking is definitely needed to make this a better product. I feel it was a total waste of my money. :( Answer: The answer is:","completion":"No, the product review is not positive. The reviewer starts by expressing their initial excitement and anticipation for the product, mentioning how they were attracted to the cute appearance of the toy and how they thought their children would enjoy playing with them. However, their enthusiasm quickly turns into disappointment as they describe their negative experiences with the product. The main issue the reviewer faces is the difficulty in opening the toy. They emphasize that even they, as a strong adult, struggle to pry the toy open, let alone their young children. This frustration leads the reviewer to explain how their children resorted to using their mouths to open the toy, which unfortunately led to further issues, such as potential harm from the metal bending and paint scratching off. The reviewer acknowledges that the concept behind the toy could be appealing and fun, but the poor execution and lack of usability make the product difficult to enjoy. They express their dissatisfaction with the purchase, ultimately saying that it was a waste of their money. As a result, the overall tone of the review is negative, indicating that the reviewer did not have a positive experience with the product and cannot recommend it to others.

Curved Air are a pioneering English progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk, and electronic sound. The resulting sound of the band was a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Along with High Tide and East of Eden, Curved Air were one of the first rock bands after It's a Beautiful Day and the United States of America to feature a violin. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke the UK Top 20, and had a hit single with \\"Back Street Luv\\" (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. However, Darryl Way and Sonja Kristina remained interested in working together, and so Way brought in two more \\"Car Thieves\\", guitarist Mick Jacques and drummer Stewart Copeland. Though more members of this new lineup came from Stark Naked and the Car Thieves than Curved Air (Kristina being the only member not from the former band), they decided to adopt the Curved Air name for the same reasons that the Kristina/Wedgwood-led band had. With Darryl Way at the helm, this new band often employed the same classical and folk influences as the original band (and even played some of the original band's songs at their shows), but their core sound was rooted in pop, rhythm and blues, and hard rock. Miles Copeland III, still serving as Curved Air's manager, put the group on his own label, BTM. The band kicked off with a European tour, which started poorly. Way, a notorious perfectionist, grew impatient with the struggling of his bandmates, especially novice drummer Copeland. Then, for reasons no one could pinpoint, the musicians suddenly \\"clicked\\" with each other and the band caught fire, quickly becoming a popular and acclaimed live act. Their studio efforts were another story, however. Phil Kohn left and the band, unable to replace him in time for the sessions for Midnight Wire, relied on guest musicians to play both bass (John G Perry) and keyboards (Peter Wood). Norma Tager, a friend of Kristina's, penned the lyrics to the \\"Midnight Wire\\" songs. Kohn was later replaced by Tony Reeves, formerly of Colosseum and Greenslade, but the recording sessions for both Midnight Wire and 1976's Airborne were expensive and highly stressful for everyone involved. Both albums - as well as \\"Desiree\\", a single drawn from Airborne - failed to break the charts. Citing dissatisfaction with BTM Records' inability to support Curved Air financially, Way departed. Though Alex Richman from the Butts Band stepped in on keyboards, the loss of the band's de facto leader was a blow. This line-up's last-ditch attempt at a hit single, a cover version of \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\", was another flop. After months of gradually losing steam, Curved Air broke up so quietly that, by Sonja Kristina's recollections, most of the music press wrote off the band's absence as a \\"sabbatical\\". Copeland formed The Police, Reeves returned to work as a producer and played in semi-pro band Big Chief along with Jacques, and Kristina and Way both pursued solo careers. Kristina and Copeland maintained the close personal relationship they'd formed while bandmates and were married in 1982. Entity:","completion":"Curved Air"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America.\\" Q: Because C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories means what controversial hypothesis may be dismissed?","completion":"Imagine there are two big families called C4c and X2a who lived a very, very long time ago. Both of these families have similarities in their ages and where they used to live. Scientists believe these two families came from different parts of the world but ended up in the Americas. Some people thought there was a special path across the ocean called the \\"Atlantic glacial entry route\\" that helped people get to America. But, because the families C4c and X2a have such similar stories and C4c was definitely from Asia, scientists now think that this ocean path idea is not true.

Build a movie plot around this: Why were there auditions to replace Georgia? She was pregnant. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: A Song for Georgia Genre: Drama, Comedy, Music Step 1: Introduce Georgia and her passion for music The movie opens with Georgia (early 30s), a talented singer and prominent member of a successful band called \\"Whistling Harmony.\\" She is shown thoroughly enjoying being on the stage, singing her heart out, and entertaining the crowd. The band members and Georgia have developed a sibling-like bond, and the audience loves their performances. Step 2: Present Georgia's life-changing news One day, after a concert, Georgia discovers that she is pregnant. While she and her partner are thrilled about the news, Georgia is hesitant to share it with the band members. She worries that this might affect the band's future performances and tours, as she won't be able to continue giving her best in the coming months. Step 3: Band members learn about Georgia's pregnancy A few weeks pass, and Georgia's absence from band practice becomes more frequent due to pregnancy-related health issues. Eventually, the band members notice the changes in Georgia and realize that she is pregnant. While they express their happiness for her, they also understand the potential impact on the band's performance schedule. Step 4: Decision to organize auditions After a group discussion, the band members reluctantly decide that they need to find a temporary replacement for Georgia to ensure the continuity of their performances. They announce auditions for a new singer, assuring Georgia that her spot in the band is secure, and they only need a temporary stand-in. Step 5: Introduce the main supporting character - Annie At the auditions, a young and talented singer named Annie gives an impressive performance, capturing the attention of the band members. They offer her the opportunity to replace Georgia temporarily, and she eagerly accepts the offer. As she joins the band, she develops a friendship with Georgia, who offers her support and guidance on working with the band. Step 6: Annie's strive to success Initially, fans of the band express their disappointment with Georgia's absence, but Annie's talent and determination eventually win their hearts. The band continues to perform well, and Georgia, although dealing with mixed emotions, remains supportive of Annie. Step 7: The turning point As Georgia's due date approaches, complications arise with her pregnancy, requiring her to be on bedrest for a prolonged period. Georgia misses the band and starts to feel even more isolated, experiencing a sense of loss and fear of being replaced permanently. Step 8: Annie's loyalty and reassurance Annie visits Georgia at home, comforting her and reassuring her that her place in the band is irreplaceable. She suggests that they write a song together, which they title \\"A Song for Georgia,\\" a tribute to Georgia's passion for music and her invaluable contribution to the band. Step 9: Climax - The emotional performance Finally, on the night of Georgia's return to the stage, the band performs \\"A Song for Georgia,\\" now a hit single, with Georgia and Annie singing it together. The audience gives a standing ovation, and Georgia finally rediscovers her confidence, joy, and passion for music. Step 10: Ending The movie ends with Georgia returning to the band and juggling her new responsibilities as a mother. Annie, grateful for the opportunity, pursues her solo career as a singer-songwriter, thankful for the lessons she learned along the way. The answer to the question is: There were auditions to replace Georgia because her pregnancy resulted in health complications and an inability to continue performing, thus requiring a temporary replacement for the band to continue its schedule without setbacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (騙體文, \\"parallel prose\\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct. This guwen (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with orthodox Neo-Confucianism.Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the... contains an answer for the question: What authors used a writing style that broke away from the style started during the Han dynasty?, what is it ?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's first break down the steps and analyze if a less strong negative charge could potentially affect any stage in the butterfly life cycle process. 1. The butterfly starts as an egg: At this stage, there is no indication that a less strong negative charge would have a direct impact on the egg. 2. The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar: Similarly, at this stage, it is not clear how a less strong negative charge would directly affect the hatching of an egg into a caterpillar. 3. The caterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows: Molting is primarily a biological process, and it is not evident that a less strong negative charge would influence this process. 4. The caterpillar then forms itself into a pupa, or chrysalis: Once again, this is a biological process that is not clearly affected by a less strong negative charge. 5. The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins to change, a process called metamorphosis: During this stage, it is not apparent that a less strong negative charge would have a direct influence on metamorphosis. 6. The caterpillar completes its metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly: As metamorphosis is a complex biological process, it is not evident that a less strong negative charge would directly affect this transformation. 7. The adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flies away: At this stage, it remains unclear how a less strong negative charge would affect the adult butterfly as it emerges and flies away. Based on the analysis of each step in the process, it appears that a less strong negative charge does not have a direct effect on any stage of the butterfly life cycle process. However, the perturbation hypothesis may have an indirect effect on the process. A less strong negative charge might potentially affect the environment or the butterfly's food resources, predators, or other interdependent species, which could consequently impact the butterfly population. These indirect effects would need to be further studied to determine if they have any influence on the number of butterflies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: William Charles Lunalilo was born on January 31, 1835 in a two-story house made of coral brick, an area known as Pohukaina, now part the grounds of the \`Iolani Palace in Honolulu. His mother was High Chiefess Miriam Auhea Kekauluohi (later styled as Ka\`ahumanu III) and his father was High Chief Charles Kana\`ina. He was grandnephew of Kamehameha I by blood and the monarch's stepson by marriage to his mother. His grandmother was Kalakua Kaheiheimalie, sister of Kamehameha's favorite wife, Queen Ka\`ahumanu. Context: When Lunalilo assumed the duties of the king, a huge change in the government's policy began to form. His predecessor, Kamehameha V, had spent his reign increasing the powers of his office and trying to restore the absolute monarchy of his grandfather, Kamehameha I. Lunalilo, however, spent his reign trying to make the Hawaiian government more democratic. He started by writing to the legislature, recommending that the constitution be amended. He wanted to undo some changes that his predecessor had made when he enacted the 1864 Constitution. For example, the Kingdom legislature prior to 1864 met in two houses: The House of Nobles and the House of Representatives. The members of the House of Nobles were appointed by the King and the Representatives were elected by popular vote. Lunalilo served in the House of Nobles from 1863 through 1872. Under King Kamehameha V, the two houses of legislature were combined into one. Lunalilo wished to restore the bicameral legislature. He also wanted to add a provision to the constitution that required the king to include a written explanation to accompany any veto by the king. He wanted cabinet ministers to be heard in the House of Representatives. The King also wanted to improve Hawaii's economic situation. The Kingdom was in an economic depression, with the whaling industry rapidly declining. Commerce groups asked the king to look at sugar to improve the economy and recommended that a treaty be drawn with the United States to allow Hawaiian sugar to enter the nation tax-free. To make such a treaty, many thought that the Kingdom would have to offer the Pearl Harbor area to the United States in exchange. There was much controversy over this, with both the public and in the legislature. When Lunalilo saw this opposition, he dropped the proposal. During Lunalilo's reign, a mutiny took place in the small Hawaiian army. Some members of the army revolted against the drillmaster and the adjutant general. The king interviewed the troops involved in the mutiny and he persuaded them to lay down their arms. Following this, the king disbanded the army. From that point on, the Kingdom had no armed forces until King Kalakaua restored them. Question: What else is significant about him being king? Answer:","completion":"Lunalilo was a special king because he wanted to make things fair for everyone in Hawaii. He tried to change the way the government worked to make it more democratic, which means giving people a chance to share their opinions and have a say in how things are run. He also cared about Hawaii's economy and tried to find new ways to make money for the kingdom, like focusing on sugar instead of whaling. Even though he faced challenges, like disagreements over Pearl Harbor and a rebellion in the military, he was a patient and kind leader who listened to others. This makes him an important and memorable king in Hawaiian history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve 0 = -11*r - 15 + 59 for r.","completion":"To solve the given equation, 0 = -11*r - 15 + 59, for the variable r, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. First, combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation. The equation becomes: 0 = -11*r + 44 Step 2: Isolate the variable term. In order to isolate the variable term (in this case, -11*r), add 11*r to both sides of the equation to eliminate it from the right side. This will give you: 11*r = 44 Step 3: Solve for the variable. Now, to find the value of r, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is -11 in this equation. This will give you: r = 44 / 11 Step 4: Simplify the result. Divide 44 by 11 to find the value of r: r = 4 So the solution to the equation 0 = -11*r - 15 + 59 is r = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met.

Answer a question about this article: In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". The band's vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys, but May stated they were not \\"much of an influence\\". What engineer helped with Queen's feedback heavy sound?","completion":"The engineer who helped with Queen's feedback heavy sound was Mike Stone. This is determined by drawing the connection from the text that specifies Mike Stone worked alongside Roy Thomas Baker, the band's former producer, in laying the groundwork for the development of Queen's distinct sound. Mike Stone is not directly credited with the feedback heavy sound, but his role as their engineer implies his significant involvement in the technical aspects of their music production, which would include creating and managing such sonic characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the outside, it appears that Roman has the perfect life: a loving wife, a successful career, and good friends. His best friend, a witty lawyer named Scott, often teases him about his seemingly perfect life. One evening, Roman returns home early from a canceled business meeting to find his wife's phone left on the kitchen counter. Noticing an incoming text message, he picks it up, only to find a message that reads, \\"I miss you. Can't wait to see you again soon.\\" The message is from a number he doesn't recognize. Act 2: Roman becomes increasingly suspicious about Veronica's behavior. Over the next few days, Roman keeps an eye on his wife and notices numerous phone calls and text messages from her \\"new friend.\\" He also discovers receipts from romantic dinners and hotel stays, which leads him to the undeniable truth that Veronica is having an affair. Consumed with a mix of anger and betrayal, Roman confides in Scott, who advises him to approach Veronica directly.

After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive \\"No Synthesisers!\\" sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-\\"hard\\"-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Coral Polge is a person who has provided comfort to thousands. She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her. Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic artist. She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died. Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life. Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait. There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception . Whatever... Options: A she could see the spirits. B she learned it from college. C she had a strong imagination. D she was gifted to feel the spirits. Answer: D she was gifted to feel the spirits. Question:","completion":"Question: According to the article, how does Coral Polge interact with spirits during her psychic artistry? A. She could see the spirits. B. She learned it from college. C. She had a strong imagination. D. She was gifted to feel the spirits. Justification: The question follows the information given in the article. Answer option 'A' is incorrect because Coral mentioned she doesn't 'see' the dead. Option 'B' is not accurate because, although Coral studied art in college, her psychic connection with spirits was not mentioned as part of her course. Option 'C' could be misleading as the article says her portraits could be attributed to a strong imagination, but this isn't how she contacts the spirits. Finally, option 'D' is the correct answer because the article says she 'feels' the spirits coming through, this communicates her unique talent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti.

Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra. contains an answer for the question: Who is discovered by a priest?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The person who is discovered by a priest in the movie narrative provided in the article is Emily. From the richly detailed plot, it is clear that the group of college students are faced with navigating through the eerie, hidden truths of the town of Quatssack. This unexpected journey takes a turn when their companion, Joe, is tragically killed, leaving the surviving quartet stranded in the town due to his possession of the car keys. As they grapple with their predicament, Emily, one of the girls in the group, seeks comfort and solace in a church. This scene sets up a crucial plot twist. During her time praying for Joe’s safety in the church, she is discovered by a priest. This encounter, however, is far from a coincidental meet-and-greet. The priest identifies Emily as the prophesied \\"Chosen One\\". According to the prophecy, the Chosen One is destined to confront and take down the Children of the Yeti, the evil cult that terrorizes the town and worships a yeti. Recognizing her pivotal role, the priest equips Emily with the supplies necessary for her destined mission. This revelation not only signals a role reversal for Emily, shifting from a simple college student to a cult-confronting heroine, but it also paves the way for what forms the crux of the succeeding events in the movie plot. Emily's discovery by the priest, therefore, structures an important turning point in the narrative, as she transforms from a casual visitor of Quatssack to a figure of prophetic importance in the town's survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to Dr. Smith's kidnapping, the city is plagued by a series of unsolved murders that seem to be linked to a mysterious figure simply known as \\"Claude.\\" Whilst investigating the case, Marc Anthony finds Dr. Smith's last research notes, which describe a groundbreaking technology with the potential to revolutionize the way humans perceive reality. Together with his new partner, Detective Elise Walker (played by Emily Blunt), Marc works tirelessly to unravel the web of secrets that surround the object of their investigation, Claude. As time runs out, and with the city growing increasingly restless due to the ongoing crimes, Marc stumbles upon a possible lead. He attends a secret underground gathering organized by a mysterious group that seeks to profit from the chaos suffocating the city. As the detectives blend into the crowd, they're both shocked to discover Claude (played by Edward Norton) blindfolded, seemingly at ease in the dimly lit room. Claude, not aware of Marc's presence, reveals that he is a victim himself. He was once a world-class magician able to manipulate reality to his advantage, but after a failed experiment using Dr. Smith's cutting-edge technology, his powers spiraled out of control. Now, blindfolded to protect himself and others from his unpredictable abilities, Claude has been coerced into serving a powerful criminal mastermind known only as \\"The Puppeteer\\" (played by Gary Oldman). The Puppeteer is determined to use both Claude's abilities and Dr. Smith's research to cause unprecedented mayhem in the city, in order to discredit the law enforcement and establish a new, powerful criminal empire. As Marc and Elise work to dismantle the organization, they ultimately convince Claude to collaborate with them. With the combined efforts of law enforcement and Claude's troubled magic, they take down The Puppeteer and reclaim their city from the powerful entity that threatened to leapfrog it to a point of no return. At the end of the film, Marc and Elise successfully release Claude from his blindfold and help him find a way to harness his powers for good, but not before they learn a thing or two about the mysteries of the reality they took for granted.

Bacteria: These processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste.

Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". How can anaerobes adjust to the surrounding environment?","completion":"Anaerobes can adjust to the surrounding environment by switching between different metabolic pathways and utilizing various terminal electron acceptors depending on the conditions they encounter. In the case of facultative anaerobes, these organisms can transition between aerobic respiration and anaerobic processes, such as fermentation, based on the availability of oxygen. When oxygen is present, facultative anaerobes utilize aerobic respiration, a process that involves the use of oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain to generate energy in the form of ATP. This is the most efficient way to derive energy from organic molecules. However, when oxygen is lacking or absent in the environment, facultative anaerobes switch to anaerobic processes like fermentation. During fermentation, organic molecules, such as pyruvate, serve as terminal electron acceptors, and energy is produced in a less efficient manner than aerobic respiration. The by-products of fermentation, which can include ethanol or lactic acid, depending on the organism, are secreted as waste. In summary, anaerobes, particularly facultative anaerobes, can adjust to their surrounding environment by altering their metabolic pathways and utilizing diverse terminal electron acceptors based on the availability of oxygen and other environmental factors.

ADVERTISEMENT In a op-ed in Young Conservatives published Friday, the former Alaska governor first expresses excitement for the Carrier employees whose jobs are staying in Indiana. “What a relief for hundreds of workers,” she wrote. “Merry Christmas Indiana!” But she goes onto to blast the deal as “crony capitalism\\" and an example of the \\"hallmark of corruption\\" and \\"socialism.\\" “When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent,” Palin wrote. “Then, special interests creep in and manipulate markets. Republicans oppose this, remember?” “Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is on big fail.” Just ahead of Trump’s formal announcement of the deal at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Carrier would receive 7 million in tax breaks over 10 years in order to keep the 1,100 jobs in Indiana. \\"However well meaning, burdensome federal government imposition is never the solution. Never. Not in our homes, not in our schools, not in churches, not in businesses,” Palin wrote in her op-ed. Earlier this week, it was reported that Palin is being considered for a spot in Trump’s administration. An aide to Palin said the former governor said “I feel as though the megaphone I have been provided can be used in a productive and positive way to help those desperately in need.” ||||| I am ecstatic for Carrier employees! Their bosses just decided to keep shop onshore. What a relief for hundreds of workers. Merry Christmas Indiana! We don’t yet know terms of the public/private deal that was cut to make the company stay, but let’s hope every business is equally incentivized to keep Americans working in America. Foundational to our exceptional nation’s sacred private property rights, a business must have freedom to locate where it wishes. In a free market, if a business makes a mistake (including a marketing mistake that perhaps Carrier executives made), threatening to move elsewhere claiming efficiency’s sake, then the market’s invisible hand punishes. Thankfully, that same hand rewards, based on good business decisions. But this time-tested truth assumes we’re operating on a level playing field. When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent. Meanwhile, the invisible hand that best orchestrates a free people’s free enterprise system gets amputated. Then, special interests creep in and manipulate markets. Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail. Politicians picking and choosing recipients of corporate welfare is railed against by fiscal conservatives, for it’s a hallmark of corruption. And socialism. The Obama Administration dealt in it in spades. Recall Solyndra, Stimulus boondoggles, and all their other taxpayer-subsidized anchors on our economy. A 20 trillion debt-ridden country can’t afford this sinfully stupid practice, so vigilantly guard against its continuance, or we’re doomed. Reaganites learned it is POLICY change that changes economic trajectory. Reagan’s successes were built on establishing a fiscal framework that invigorated our entire economy, revitalized growth and investment while decreasing spending, tax rates, over-reaching regulations, unemployment, and favoritism via individual subsidies. We need Reaganites in the new Administration. However well meaning, burdensome federal government imposition is never the solution. Never. Not in our homes, not in our schools, not in churches, not in businesses. Gotta’ have faith the Trump team knows all this. And I’ll be the first to acknowledge concerns over a deal cut by leveraging taxpayer interests to make a manufacturer stay put are unfounded – once terms are made public. But know that fundamentally, political intrusion using a stick or carrot to bribe or force one individual business to do what politicians insist, versus establishing policy incentivizing our ENTIRE ethical economic engine to roar back to life, isn’t the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to when presenting a case before the supreme court. approximately how long does each side have??","completion":"In the United States, when presenting a case before the Supreme Court, each side is typically granted a limited amount of time to present their arguments. The conventional duration is 30 minutes for each party. This time allocation ensures that the justices have enough time to thoughtfully consider the issue under review and allows both sides to concisely address their main points. It is important to note that in addition to the allocated 30 minutes, the justices may ask questions and engage in discussion with the attorneys that can extend the length of the oral arguments. This constant exchange between the parties enables the justices to better understand the issues at play and foster a robust and constructive conversation. However, the Supreme Court may occasionally allot a different amount of time for specific cases if the Court believes that the complexity of the case warrants more or less time. Before the oral arguments take place, both petitioner (party who is seeking Supreme Court's review) and respondent (party who opposes review) must submit briefs that provide a detailed explanation of their position in the case. These briefs give the justices an opportunity to review the arguments in depth before the oral arguments session. Sometimes, even third-party groups or individuals, often referred to as \\"friends of the court\\" or amici curiae, submit briefs offering additional information or perspective on the issues at hand. After the conclusion of oral arguments, the Supreme Court deliberates in private and issues its ruling, which may take days, weeks, or even months depending on the complexity and considerations involved in the case. This final decision, along with the opinions of the justices, is published and has a far-reaching impact on the nation's legal landscape. Therefore, to sum up, when presenting a case before the Supreme Court, each side is usually granted 30 minutes for oral arguments. However, the time can be adjusted based on the complexity of the case and at the discretion of the Court. The justices may actively participate by asking questions and engaging in discussions, extending the overall length of the oral arguments session. Moreover, the submitted briefs and the final decision process help shape the outcome of the case and further contribute to its possible implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: The American Dream has become making movies. Hypothesis: Making movies is now the American Dream, said the governor. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. In this case, let us first define both the terms - premise and hypothesis - and then elaborate on whether the statement above reflects an entailed relationship between them. A premise refers to a proposition or statement from which another statement or conclusion is inferred or follows as a logical consequence, often as part of an argument or reasoning process. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation or assumption made on the basis of limited evidence, serving as a starting point for further investigation. In this context, a hypothesis can be seen as a conclusion that is drawn from the given premise. In the given statements, Premise: The American Dream has become making movies. Hypothesis: Making movies is now the American Dream, said the governor. We can see that the hypothesis is a rephrased version of the premise, with the added information of its attribution to the governor. The hypothesis clearly follows from the premise as a logical consequence. The premise suggests that the concept of the American Dream has evolved to the point where making movies represents that aspiration. The hypothesis, which states that \\"making movies is now the American Dream\\" mirrors this notion by asserting the same idea. Furthermore, the mention of the governor adds credibility to the statement, as it implies that this belief is recognized or endorsed by a figure of authority. In summary, the premise does entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis presents a logical and coherent conclusion based on the information provided in the premise. In this case, the hypothesis reinforces the idea of the evolving American Dream and attributes it to a source that grants the statement a certain degree of credibility. Therefore, we can conclude that the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The given equation is -11 = p - 6. Step 2: Observe the given equation. In the equation -11 = p - 6, we are supposed to find the value of p. The objective is to isolate the variable and make p the subject of the formula. Step 3: Isolate the variable. The given equation is -11 = p - 6. Let's isolate p by adding 6 to both sides of the equation. By doing this, we cancel out the -6 on the right side of the equation, and in turn, we get the following equation: -11 + 6 = p - 6 + 6 Now, simplify the equation: -5 = p Step 4: Write the solution. So, the solution to the equation -11 = p - 6 is p = -5. This means that when the value of p is -5, the equation holds true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Born on April 30, 1912, Kroggel made his mark in the world of fencing, a sport that requires a combination of speed, strategy, and agility. Fencing has a long history, with its origins dating back to ancient civilizations. The modern sport of fencing consists of three disciplines: foil, épée, and sabre. Each discipline has its own set of rules, equipment, and techniques. Erwin Kroggel specialized in the épée event, which is characterized by its heavier sword and the ability to score points via hits on the opponent's entire body. The individual épée event at the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki, Finland, was one of several Olympic fencing events designed to test the skill, strength, and determination of competitors. The event featured a men's individual épée competition, where fencers from around the world gathered to showcase their talents and vie for Olympic glory. In the lead-up to the 1952 Summer Olympics, Erwin Kroggel would have undoubtedly trained tirelessly to refine his technique, improve his fitness, and study his opponents. Fencing bout strategies require a blend of both physical and mental discipline, often involving careful observation of opponents and the ability to adapt tactics on the fly. Despite Kroggel's efforts and accomplishments in the sport of fencing, details surrounding his specific performance at the 1952 Summer Olympics are limited.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step in the process of oxygen entering the body is the lungs expanding. This occurs as a result of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contracting, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity and decreases the pressure inside it. This pressure difference causes air from outside the body to be drawn into the lungs through the mouth or nose, down the trachea, and into the bronchi and bronchioles, ultimately reaching the alveoli.

Handwash only.Grind your beans the night before (you really do need a burr mill grinder for consistent grind) and toss some water in the microwave, and this only takes slightly more effort in the morning than a automatic drip machine.

Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given product review, it appears to be generally positive with some minor reservations. The reviewer starts by mentioning their personal preference for French Press coffee but acknowledges that the device in question works as advertised. They also state that they have not encountered any issues with the plastic dulling or cloudiness which has been reported in other reviews.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue the following story. Mary scoffed at Jane's new hat, but was jealous of Jane's new watch, because Mary yearned for the","completion":"time when she, too, had a stunning accessory that she could boast about. It had been far too long since she'd treated herself to something exquisite, as a string of unfortunate events left her strapped for cash and desperate for some sort of change in her life. As the gossip filled the air, Mary knew this was the perfect opportunity to rekindle the subtle rivalry they had maintained throughout the years. The envy that seethed inside her as she watched Jane flaunt her new hat and watch urged her to seek out a piece that would surely outshine Jane's entire collection of accessories. Later that evening, Mary prepared a detailed plan to track down a showstopping piece she'd heard whispers about: the famed and elusive Red Phoenix Diamond. Rumors swirled that this exceptional gemstone was cursed, but Mary decided to put aside her superstitions for the opportunity to make a statement and outdo Jane. Little did she know, the Red Phoenix Diamond was more than just a myth. The following day, Mary embarked on her quest. She began her search in one of the many antique shops littering her city, thinking that such a mysterious and valuable item would likely be hidden in plain sight. After scouring numerous boutiques and corner stores, Mary eventually found herself standing outside the door of the least known and most impenetrable of establishments: The Black Cat Antique Shop. With a deep breath, she pushed open the door and the thick scent of musty books and dust enveloped her. Undeterred, Mary carefully combed through every nook and cranny, but the Red Phoenix Diamond seemed to elude her grasp. Just as she was about to admit defeat and leave, she spotted a man in a corner, shrouded in shadows. He stood too still to be just another patron, and his eyes seemed to follow her like a hawk stalking its prey. Driven by curiosity and desperation, Mary approached the shadowy figure and mustered the courage to speak. \\"I'm looking for something extraordinary, a treasure like no other,\\" she said, hesitating only briefly, \\"the Red Phoenix Diamond. Do you know where I can find it?\\" The stranger remained silent for a moment, but then leaned closer to reveal his worn but wise-looking face. \\"You're playing a dangerous game, young lady,\\" he whispered in a gravelly tone. \\"The Red Phoenix Diamond is not something anyone should tamper with. It is known to have sealed within it a curse that brings grave misfortune to any who possess it.\\" Despite the man's warnings, Mary was determined to have the gemstone to outshine Jane. She challenged the stranger to reveal the diamond's location. Hesitantly, he agreed to help her, but not before making her swear a solemn oath to respect the powers of the famed diamond. The stranger directed Mary to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city, where the Red Phoenix Diamond was believed to be hidden. Steeling herself, she ventured within the crumbling building, scouring it for any sign of the gemstone. After a long night of searching, she finally stumbled across a small hidden chamber at the heart of the warehouse, and there, resting on a velvet cushion, sat the magnificent Red Phoenix Diamond. It was even more radiant than the stories foretold; the vibrant red hue of the diamond seemed to glow with an inner fire. Ignoring the dark presence that prevailed in the chamber, Mary lifted the gemstone and reluctantly acknowledged the weight of her oath. Aware of the curse, she decided to consult with someone knowledgeable about such matters to safely wear the gemstone. Over the following weeks, Mary consulted with psychics, shamans, and jewelers alike, learning about the gemstone's curse and ways to protect herself from its malignant powers. She had the diamond set into a dazzling necklace, imbued with magic-infused materials, which she hoped would shield her from the darker side of its history. At last, the day came for her to unveil her astonishing find. Mary knew the addition of the Red Phoenix Diamond necklace would shock the gossip mill, and leave Jane flabbergasted. Dressed to the nines with the striking gemstone resting around her neck, she stepped into the room, commanding the attention of everyone present. As expected, Jane's eyes widened in disbelief and jealousy coursed through her veins. Mary reveled in the moment, letting the envy of the room wash over her. However, as the night wore on, whispers began not just about Mary's incredible find, but also about those before her who had fallen victim to the curse. Unnerved by the conversation, Mary desperately clung to the hope that her magic-infused necklace would keep the curse at bay. Yet, despite her efforts, Mary couldn't ignore the nagging suspicion that the curse had already set its roots deep within her life. She began to question her choices, the motivations that led her to seek something so dangerous simply to overshadow her rival. As she confronted her untamed ambition and envy, she found herself in a struggle to break free from the darkness the Red Phoenix Diamond had brought upon her life. Only time would tell if Mary could navigate the treacherous path ahead, between the envy that drove her and the curse that haunted her. As the events of her life continued to unravel, the ruthless rivalry between Mary and Jane began to fade in significance. She realized that perhaps the true battle was never against Jane, but ultimately against herself and the darkness she had invited into her life. Mary knew that in order to put an end to the curse and the envy that consumed her, she would need to embark on a harrowing journey of self-discovery and redemption. She would need to uncover the truth behind the Red Phoenix Diamond's curse and confront the inner demons that haunted her. As her story continued, Mary would be forced to examine her motivations, face the consequences of her actions, and ultimately discover the strength within her to triumph over the darkness that had invaded her life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Why does he get so little sleep ?","completion":"The individual in question appears to be getting little sleep due to a combination of factors related to early fatherhood, work commitments, and existing insomnia issues. Let's explore each contributing factor in more detail. 1. Early fatherhood: Having a newborn baby can be an overwhelming experience, as the baby requires constant care and attention. The individual's baby, Sloane, likely wakes up multiple times during the night, and being an insomniac, the father is available to comfort and play with her when she is up. Newborns typically have unpredictable sleeping patterns, as their circadian rhythm – the body's internal clock that controls sleep-wake cycles – takes time to develop. This inconsistency in the baby's sleep cycle disrupts the father's ability to get a full night's sleep. 2. Insomnia: As the individual mentions being an insomniac, it indicates that they have a pre-existing problem with sleep. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for people to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both. Insomniacs often struggle with getting sufficient sleep even when they have the opportunity for proper rest. In this case, the father's insomnia compounds the sleep disruptions caused by caring for a newborn baby, making it even more challenging for him to get adequate sleep. 3. Work commitments: The father has a daily routine that involves going to work after taking care of Sloane in the morning, and then returning in the evening to spend more time with her and his wife. The exhaustion from work combined with the responsibility of child care leaves little room for rest. Furthermore, having to wake up around 6 am after going to bed close to 3 am results in only about 3 hours of sleep, which is significantly less than the recommended 7-9 hours for adults. 4. Balancing personal relationships: Besides taking care of the baby, the father also spends time with his wife and values their relationship. He attends to her needs and ensures that she also gets her rest, which is essential during the postpartum period. Balancing the needs of the newborn baby, the spouse, and personal mental health may significantly impact the amount of sleep the father gets. In summary, the individual gets very little sleep mainly due to the sleep interruptions caused by early fatherhood, exacerbated by his pre-existing insomnia, work commitments, and the necessity to balance personal relationships. This combination of factors creates a challenging environment in which it is difficult for him to achieve sufficient restorative sleep."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A couple booking a two-week holiday to Greece were left £600 out of pocket after they paid extra for a holiday bungalow, only to be put in a hotel room on arrival. Ken Marlow, 68, and his wife Dorothy, 58, wanted to stay at the Belvedere Hotel on the Greek island of Skiathos, but were disappointed to be told by Thomas Cook that the rooms were fully booked. Instead, the holiday company offered the couple, from Moorside, Sunderland, a stay in a bungalow on the property for £578.86 more. Ken and Dorothy Marlow have received a full refund after they were overcharged by more than half of the overall booking for a bungalow they never even got to stay in. However, when the couple arrived at the resort, they were told the bungalows were fully booked and they would instead be placed in a double room. The Marlows complained when they got home and despite admitting the brochure was 'confusing', Thomas Cook initially refused to refund the full amount. Mr Marlow was contacted by Thomas Cook's customer relations department which admitted the brochure description was 'really confusing.' The pensioner was offered just £260 in vouchers or £209 in cash in a full and final settlement but neither amount covered what he had been overcharged. However, after local newspapers took up the battle, the couple have now been given an apology, refund, and compensation from Thomas Cook. The couple have accepted £700 after the company blamed a 'technical fault' for charging too much. The Marlows have been given a full refund, plus compensation after the booking blunder. Mr Marlow said: 'I went to the Thomas Cook shop to book a holiday with a twin/double room at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece. 'The sales assistant told me no twin/double rooms were available on our chosen dates. 'There was, however, a family bungalow for three or four persons but I would have to pay extra for under occupancy. 'Having studied the brochure we decided the Belvedere was where we wanted to stay, so I agreed, and looked forward to having a bit more room to spread out.' On arrival, however, it was a completely different story. Mr Marlow, said: 'We were told that no bungalows were available and that we would have to stay in a double room. 'This, of course, was what we had wanted all along but a holiday that should have cost £1,118 cost me, somehow, £1,696.86, meaning I was overcharged by £578.86. 'It seems Thomas Cook and the Belvedere were not using the same data and, therefore, there was wrong information in the brochure.' The company admitted in email correspondence that the brochure was 'confusing' but refused to compensate to the amount Mr Marlow had been overcharged. The Marlows, from Sunderland, arrived at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece to be told their booking for a bungalow was not possible. A spokesman for the company said: 'At Thomas Cook we pride ourselves on offering the best value holidays in the market. We would like to express our apologies to Mr Marlow for the inconvenience of additional charges incurred while on holiday. 'These were due to a pricing discrepancy caused by a technical fault at the time of booking. 'Thomas Cook would like to reassure customers that such pricing errors are rare and a full investigation has been carried out to ensure that there are no further issues of this nature. 'We can confirm that Mr Marlow has now accepted a full refund for the extra costs and has stated that he is looking forward to booking his next holiday with Thomas Cook.' Thomas Cook said that that the difference between what Mr Marlow was charged and what he should have been charged had been fully refunded - despite the earlier refusal - and they had also offered a gesture of goodwill by way of apology. Mr Marlow said he was delighted with the result. 'They have refunded what I wanted all along and rounded the amount up to £700,' he added.

Title: Benny's Video Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film opens with a home video of the slaughter with a captive bolt pistol of a pig on a European farm. The video rewinds to play the slaughter in slow motion, which emphasizes the hand-held barrel against the pig's fore-skull and the cartridge explosion. A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna, when they return home while the party is in progress. The host of the party, Eva, is their daughter who lives in another part of town and who has, it turns out in questioning of Benny after the incident, taken advantage of the planned absence of Georg and Anna to host the impromptu party in their home. While watching a newscast, Georg and Anna discuss the money Eva won in the pyramid scheme she was promoting at the party. In a locker room at school, Benny encourages his friends to take positions in his own Pilot and Passengers game. While his parents are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. He shows her the video of the pig slaughter, and they talk about the film. She: \\"Did you make this film? How was it, with the pig? I mean, have you ever seen a dead person--a real one, I mean?\\" Benny: \\"No. I once saw a TV program about the tricks they use in action films. It's all ketchup and plastic,\\" and then he unveils and loads the slaughtering gun. He holds it against his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward (Feigling!). He holds it against her chest, and when he hesitates, she calls him a Feigling also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame, Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back...

What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario? Answer the above question based on the context below: Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.","completion":"The last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

The narrating nurse might also believe in the importance of standing up against mistreatment of patients, as evidenced by their confrontation with the impatient nurse. They could also be curious about the long-term consequences of Connie S.'s miraculous recovery and how her life unfolded after leaving the ward.

Hypothesis: Franz Joseph Haydn developed chamber music. Select from the following. --Yes. --It's impossible to say. --No.","completion":"Yes, based on the given context, we can draw the hypothesis that Franz Joseph Haydn played a crucial role in the development of chamber music. Specifically, he was instrumental in shaping the piano trio, one form of chamber music. Additionally, his significant contributions to musical form, which have earned him the titles \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet,\\" further support the argument that Haydn was influential in the realm of chamber music. Chamber music is a form of classical music composed for a small group of instruments. It can be showcased in more intimate settings compared to large orchestra performances. During the Classical period, chamber music further evolved, with composers such as Haydn significantly impacting its growth. Haydn was a prolific composer, known for creating over 100 symphonies. These symphonies, as well as his work with string quartets, showcased an evolving style that set the stage for others to build upon. As the \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet,\\" Haydn demonstrated innovative thinking and mastery in composition. His ability to experiment with forms and ideas exemplify how his work was pivotal in shaping chamber music as we know it today. In conclusion, we can confidently state the hypothesis that Franz Joseph Haydn was a crucial figure in the development of chamber music. His work in the Classical period significantly influenced the evolution of this musical genre, with lasting effects on the growth of piano trios, symphonies, and string quartets. Thus, Haydn's contributions to chamber music are both evident and undeniable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the simplified left side. Now, the equation looks like this: 584*t = 135*t - 7184. Step 3: Isolate variable \\"t\\" by eliminating the term with \\"t\\" on the right side. To do this, we'll subtract 135*t from both sides of the equation: 584*t - 135*t = 135*t - 7184 - 135*t.

After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellant, the shark explodes.

The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

A:","completion":"In the article about Ricketts Glen State Park, it states that Jesse Dodson, one of the earliest settlers in the area, built two structures. These structures were a sawmill and a dam. The sawmill was used by Dodson to make bed frames from cherry trees that he cut for lumber.

The situation is further controversial due to the fact that the company responsible for carrying out this campaign is run by the Prime Minister's son. In the lead-up to an election, political parties and candidates often use various methods and strategies to communicate their messages, policies, and promises to potential voters. One such method is email campaigns, which involve sending emails to a large number of people to gain their attention and support. However, when such campaigns send unsolicited messages or are perceived as spam, they can attract controversy and backlash. In this instance, Prime Minister John Howard has admitted to financially supporting an email campaign that has been criticized as spam. The fact that Howard's son's company is behind this campaign adds an extra layer of conflict, raising ethical questions around nepotism, favoritism, and ensuring a level playing field when it comes to political communication. The text suggests that the Prime Minister faced significant criticism for his decision to bankroll this campaign, putting his credibility and judgment as a leader under scrutiny. It is likely that opponents would argue that such practices are unfair and inappropriate in an electoral context, where transparency and equitable communication methods are crucial to the democratic process. In summary, this text is about Australian Prime Minister John Howard admitting to funding a controversial pre-election email campaign, which has been labeled as spam, and the company responsible for this campaign is run by his son.

There are two rival gangs in Vasco, called the Bichhoos (Scorpions in Hindi), who are Hindus, and the Eagles, who are Christians. Bichoo gang's leader is Prakash (Sharad Kapoor), while the Eagles are led by Max (Shah Rukh Khan). They are all enemies, they fight, run, chase, and beat. But they are usually stopped from fights by Father Jacob, or the Town Inspector (Sharat Saxena). One day Prakash's brother Rahul (Chandrachur Singh) comes to visit after 2 years, who is a master-chef working in Mumbai. Rahul loves Goa the more he sees of it, and as he tours around Vasco, he meets Shirley (Aishwarya Rai), the twin sister of Max and he falls in love with her straightaway. Knowing about Eagles and Bicchhoo rivalry, Rahul keeps his mouth closed. He opens a pastry shop 'Treat House' and settles in Vasco. Meanwhile, he becomes part of the Eagles-Bichchoo rivalry, and gets closer to Shirley. The whole situation is unprecedented in this city, which gets all the more intriguing when Rahul comes across a secret about Max and Shirley's past; a secret that will change their lives forever, and that, which leads to a death. He comes to know that Max and Shirley were actually the illegitimate children of Alberto Vasco, the founder of the town. Rahul wants to reveal this to Shirley in a letter but due to circumstances it falls in the hands of Prakash. Prakash plans to murder Max, to get his father's lands worth Rs. 20 lakh. This leads to fight sequence between both, where Max accidentally shoots Prakash while defending himself. Max is arrested and his trial puts a rift between Shirley and Rahul.

Context: In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\" The answer is:","completion":"Antihumanists failed to offer an alternative emancipatory project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Pepsi Charity Contest Trips Over Its Own Submission Rules Pepsi is planning to give more than 20 million to charities through a contest called Pepsi Refresh, the most ambitious so far among a number of similar contests that have used social networks on the Internet to raise money and recognition for nonprofit groups and social causes. But, like some of its predecessors, Pepsi Refresh has stumbled over its own rules. The tiny charity currently atop the rankings in one category of the contest accidentally got a little help from Pepsi itself. Materials submitted by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a charity started by Mariska Hargitay, one of the stars of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” to help victims of sexual assault, were updated by the staff at Pepsi after the submission deadline, which is against the contest rules. That upset some of the contestants who wondered whether Pepsi was doing favors for a celebrity. “I can’t edit my own submission, so how did she do it?” said one contestant, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his chances of winning. Just an honest mistake, says Pepsi. “We didn’t follow our guidelines to the letter,” said Jill Beraud, chief marketing officer for the American beverages unit at Pepsi. “The bottom line is that we’ve learned from this and we’re moving on.” The company said it would give away three 250,000 prizes, instead of two as originally planned. The company worked with experts in social media in hopes of avoiding problems other companies have encountered. Ms. Beraud said that so far it had exceeded expectations in terms of the number of people who have voted, the number of submissions and the response from bottlers and employees. A thousand organizations compete for 5,000, 25,000, 50,000 and 250,000 grants in each month at least through the end of the year, using materials and information they must submit before each monthly contest begins. Those materials cannot be edited once the particular contest starts. But a video clip that is embedded in Joyful Heart’s pitch was clearly made after the submission deadline. Featuring Ms. Hargitay and Justine Ezarik, the blogosphere and Twitter phenom, the video incorporates a photo of the Pepsi Refresh Web site, which went up only after the submission deadline had passed. The Joyful Heart submission originally included a link to a video on YouTube, and the Pepsi staff decided it would be simpler for Pepsi Refresh voters to view the video directly on the Pepsi Refresh site. Ms. Beraud said she was certain the video had not given an advantage to Joyful Heart, which had 6 percent more votes than its closest competitor the day before and the day after the video was embedded. (Pepsi does not release vote totals, only rankings.)","completion":"Pepsi is having a charity contest called Pepsi Refresh, where they will give more than 20 million to charities.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. Question: What is probably true about Trump?

Pick from: 1). show their driver license. 2). text. 3). avoid the police. Answer:","completion":"Addison, realizing the seriousness of the car accident, will most likely want to show their driver's license. This is because doing so is a responsible and legally required action after being involved in a car accident. By providing their driver's license, they are ensuring that they are being transparent and cooperative with the other party involved and any responding law enforcement officers. In contrast, the other options present less appropriate or responsible choices. Texting, for example, could be seen as neglecting the severity of the situation and a lack of empathy for anyone else involved. Additionally, texting immediately after an accident might even be illegal in some jurisdictions, as authorities may interpret it as a sign of distracted driving. As for avoiding the police, this is highly inadvisable and could cause further legal trouble for Addison. Evading law enforcement after an accident can lead to hit-and-run accusations, fines, and possibly even criminal charges. Furthermore, escaping the scene sends a negative message about Addison's willingness to take responsibility for their actions and indicates a lack of concern for the well-being of others. By choosing to show their driver's license, Addison demonstrates that they understand the gravity of the situation and are willing to cooperate with the other party involved in the accident, as well as any potential legal repercussions. This choice exhibits accountability and mature decision-making, attributes that will bode well for Addison as they navigate the aftermath of the car accident."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining the Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential \\"chart winner\\" by Billboard magazine. Despite this, it managed only a meagre chart peak of 135—a sign of the band's flagging popularity in the American market.The Kinks' next single was a social commentary piece entitled \\"Dead End...

The emotions conveyed through the text indicate distress and struggles with mental health. Here's an in-depth analysis of the tweet to help clarify the choice: Tweet: \\"I can't do it!!!!!!! I'm nearing clinical depression right now\\" 1. The phrase \\"I can't do it\\" demonstrates a sense of hopelessness and inability to perform or accomplish a specific task or handle a situation. This kind of statement usually indicates frustration, overwhelming emotions, or a lack of self-confidence, all of which are considered negative emotions. 2. The excessive use of exclamation marks after the phrase \\"I can't do it!!!!!!!\\" implies a strong emphasis on the emotion being conveyed. This kind of punctuation is used to highlight the urgency or severity of the situation, further emphasizing the negative sentiment in this tweet. 3. The statement \\"I'm nearing clinical depression right now\\" indicates that the individual is struggling with their mental health and experiencing significant difficulties. Clinical depression is a severe mental health disorder characterized by pervasive feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. Mentioning clinical depression in this context suggests that the person is going through an extremely challenging time, which is undoubtedly a negative sentiment.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"A medical prohibition for Witnesses refers to the restrictions and limitations Jehovah's Witnesses place on certain medical treatments based on their religious beliefs and principles. One of the most well-known prohibitions is their refusal to accept blood transfusions of whole blood, as they believe it is against God's commandments to consume or accept blood in any form. However, they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion. The Watch Tower Society, the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses, provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents, which are legal documents specifying the medical treatments and procedures a person allows or prohibits in case they are unable to make their own decisions due to illness or incapacitation. These documents help Witnesses to clearly state their preferences when it comes to receiving major blood components and enable them to specify which allowable blood fractions and treatments they will personally accept. In order to facilitate communication and increase understanding between Jehovah's Witnesses and healthcare providers, Hospital Liaison Committees have been established. These committees act as a bridge between individual Jehovah's Witnesses, medical professionals, and hospitals, ensuring that the patient's beliefs, needs, and concerns are understood and respected. They also provide valuable resources and information to medical professionals about alternative treatments and procedures that can be used in place of blood transfusions when treating Jehovah's Witness patients. In summary, the medical prohibition for Jehovah's Witnesses mainly revolves around their refusal to accept blood transfusions of whole blood and certain blood components. They have established specific guidelines, legal documents, and committees to help uphold these beliefs while maintaining open communication and cooperation with healthcare providers to ensure quality treatment and care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The economy of Isola Superiore is based entirely on agriculture. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence is true, which describes Isola dei Pescatori (a.k.a. Isola Superiore) as a delightfully peaceful fishing village with narrow streets, it is not necessarily contradictory to the second sentence, which claims that the economy of Isola Superiore is based entirely on agriculture. However, we should examine both sentences in more detail in order to better explore the relationship between them and whether they are compatible. In the first sentence, the main focus is on the island's atmosphere and physical setting. It is described as being a peaceful fishing village, which suggests that fishing is a significant activity on the island. However, the sentence does not provide information on how important fishing is to the economy of the island, or if it's just a cultural or historical aspect of Isola Superiore. On the other hand, the second sentence focuses on the economy of Isola Superiore, stating that it is based entirely on agriculture. The use of the term \\"entirely\\" implies that agriculture is the sole basis for economic activity on the island. It's important to note that fishing and agriculture can coexist as parallel economic activities on the same island. Agriculture could include a variety of practices, such as cultivating crops and raising livestock, while fishing could involve both freshwater and saltwater fishing. In this case, both sentences may be true together, if we consider that fishing is a part of the broader agricultural activities or serves as a supplementary economic activity that contributes to the island's identity as a fishing village. However, if we take the literal interpretation of \\"entirely\\" in the second sentence to mean that agriculture is the one and only economic activity on the island, then this could be seen as contradictory to the description of the island as a fishing village in the first sentence. In this case, we would need further information to determine the exact relationship between fishing and agriculture on Isola Superiore in order to decide if these two sentences are both true. In conclusion, if we take the descriptions in the first sentence and the second sentence at face value, there is a potential contradiction between them when considering the role of fishing in the island's economy. However, without additional context or information about the specific economic activities on Isola Superiore, it is not possible to definitively say whether the second sentence is true or false based solely on the information in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the first real name of the person that agrees to invest 1000 in Ossining's business? Answer the above question based on the context below: Dr. John Harvey Kellogg opened a sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he practiced his unusual methods for maintaining health, including colonic irrigation, electrical stimulus and sexual abstinence, vegetarianism and physical exercise. The sanitarium attracts well-to-do patients including William and Eleanor Lightbody, who are suffering from poor health following the death of their child. On their way to Battle Creek they meet Charles Ossining, hoping to make a fortune by exploiting the fad for health food cereals. Ossining finds a partner in Goodloe Bender. Having enlisted the services of George Kellogg, the doctor's estranged adopted son, they attempt to produce \\"Kellogg's Perfo Flakes.\\" In the sanitarium, Will Lightbody is separated from his wife, and is soon harboring lustful thoughts toward Nurse Graves and patient Ida Muntz. His wife Eleanor, meanwhile, befriends Virginia Cranehill, who has a modern attitude toward sexual pleasure, influenced by the works of Dr. Lionel Badger. Will eventually succumbs to Ida Muntz's charms. Later he learns that Ida has died during treatment. Following the death of a patient in the sinusoidal bath, and the discovery of yet another death, Will suffers a breakdown, flees the sanitarium, gets drunk and eats meat. At a restaurant, he meets Ossining, and agrees to invest 1,000 in his health food business. Will returns drunk to the sanitarium, where he is reprimanded by Dr. Kellogg and is abandoned by a distraught Eleanor. Ossining's business is a disaster, with no edible product.

No, these questions do not have the same meaning. While both questions are related to human emotions, relationships, and social norms, they address different aspects of these topics. The first question - \\"Why do people think love is magical? I think it's more about physical beauty.\\" - deals with perceptions of love and the role of physical attractiveness in relationships. It asks why people believe love to be a magical or extraordinary emotion when, to the person asking the question, it might seem that physical beauty plays a larger part in forming romantic connections. This question encourages discussion about the nature of love, the factors that contribute to romantic attraction, and the potential overemphasis on physical appearance in society. The second question - \\"Why is it that in India people don't talk about sex as much as they think about it?\\" - deals with cultural norms and attitudes regarding sex in India. It highlights a perceived discrepancy between the frequency with which people in India think about sex and their willingness to discuss it openly. This question invites exploration of the historical, cultural, and societal factors that contribute to this sexual reticence, as well as comparisons to norms and attitudes in other cultures. To summarize, the two questions do share some similarities, as both address aspects of human emotion, attraction, and social norms.

He served as the head football coach at Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University and Wittenberg University in a career lasting more than 30 years, compiling a win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8. Edwards also coached the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1941 to 1942, tallying a 4-9-1 record, and served as an assistant coach for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in the late 1940s. Raised near Massillon, Ohio, Edwards was the son of an immigrant from Wales who worked in the area's coal mines. Having built a strong record at Western Reserve, Edwards was in the running for head coaching roles at a number of larger universities and professional teams. He met with officials at Marquette University and was considered a candidate for coaching duties at Colorado University and for the National Football League's Detroit Lions. After visiting with Lions owner Fred Mandel, Edwards ultimately was hired in February 1941 to succeed George Clark. Both Edwards and Dugan Miller signed two-year contracts. Edwards was given a 10,000 annual salary (166,380 in 2017 dollars), more than double the 4,420 he was paid at Western Reserve. Edwards's stint as the Lions coach was unsuccessful. He guided the team to a 4-6-1 record in 1941, and Mandel fired him after three straight losses to begin the 1942 season as the team's roster was depleted by players' service in World War II. Detroit went on to lose all the rest of its games after John Karcis was named his replacement. Edwards enlisted in the U.S. Navy later in 1942 as America's involvement in the war intensified. While in the military, he served at St. Mary's Pre-Flight, a training program in California, and coached the Air Devils football team there. He also served at a base in Pensacola, Florida. Edwards was discharged in 1946, and spent a year in the sporting goods business in Cleveland, Ohio before reuniting with Brown, who had become the first coach of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Edwards took a position as a tackle coach and remained with the team for two seasons. He coached tackles including Ernie Blandin, Lou Rymkus and future Pro Football Hall of Fame member Lou Groza. The Browns won the AAFC championship in both of Edwards's years as an assistant; the team won all of its games in 1948, turning in professional football's first perfect season.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

Information: - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \\"Apostle to the English\\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams. - Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury and the most senior bishop in the Church of England. Welby was the vicar of Southam, Warwickshire, and most recently was the Bishop of Durham, serving for just over a year. As Archbishop of Canterbury he is the Primate of All England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion. - The Gnostic Gospels are a collection of about 54 ancient texts based upon the teachings of several spiritual leaders, which were written from the 2nd to the 4th century AD. The sayings of the Gospel of Thomas, compiled circa 140, may include some traditions even older than some of the gospels of the New Testament, possibly as early as the second half of the first century. These gospels are not part of the standard Biblical canon of any mainstream Christian denomination, and as such are part of what is called the New Testament apocrypha. Recent novels, films, and video games that refer to the gospels have increased public interest. - The Gregorian mission or Augustinian mission was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to convert Britain's Anglo-Saxons. Headed by Augustine of Canterbury, by the death of the last missionary in 635 the mission had established Christianity in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and Frankish missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the Hiberno-Scottish missions to Continental Europe. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - Ini Kopuria ( died 1945 ) , a police officer from Maravovo , Guadalcanal , Solomon Islands formed the Melanesian Brotherhood in 1925 . He and the Bishop of Melanesia , the Right Reverend John Manwaring Steward , realised Ini 's dream by forming a band of brothers ( known in the Mota language as ' Ira Reta Tasiu ' ) to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the non-Christian areas of Melanesia . He is commemorated in the calendars of saints of the Church of the Province of Melanesia , of the Church of England , and of the Episcopal Church ( USA ) . - The Northern Solomons were the more northerly group of islands in the Solomon Islands archipelago over which Germany declared a protectorate in 1885. Initially the German Solomon Islands Protectorate included Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java Islands, but in 1900 these islands were transferred to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The largest of the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, continued under German administration until World War I when it fell to Australia, and after the war, it formally passed to Australian jurisdiction under a League of Nations mandate. Today, the original North Solomon Islands are split between the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea and the successor state of the British Solomon Islands which was officially renamed from \\"the British Solomon Islands Protectorate\\" to \\"Solomon Islands\\" in 1975 prior to becoming an independent, sovereign state in 1976. - The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across all of Europe during this period. Many factors contributed to the process: the decline of feudalism and the rise of nationalism, the rise of the common law, the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible, and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. However, the various phases of the English Reformation, which also covered Wales and Ireland, were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself. - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji. - The Melanesian Brotherhood is an Anglican religious community of men in simple vows based primarily in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea. - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion. - A gospel is an account describing the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. The most widely known examples are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John which are included in the New Testament, but the term can also used to refer to apocryphal, non-canonical, JewishChristian and gnostic gospels. - Augustine of Canterbury (first third of the 6th century probably 26 May 604) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597. He is considered the \\"Apostle to the English\\" and a founder of the English Church. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Guadalcanal (indigenous name: \\"Isatabu\\") is the principal island in Guadalcanal Province of the nation of Solomon Islands in the south-western Pacific, northeast of Australia. Its European discovery was under the Spanish expedition of Álvaro de Mendaña in 1568. The name comes from Guadalcanal, a village in the province of Seville, in Andalusia, Spain, birthplace of Pedro de Ortega Valencia, a member of Mendaña's expedition.

The number is not known with any confidence; new sign languages emerge frequently through creolization and de novo (and occasionally through language planning). In some countries, such as Sri Lanka and Tanzania, each school for the deaf may have a separate language, known only to its students and sometimes denied by the school; on the other hand, countries may share sign languages, though sometimes under different names (Croatian and Serbian, Indian and Pakistani). Deaf sign languages also arise outside educational institutions, especially in village communities with high levels of congenital deafness, but there are significant sign languages developed for the hearing as well, such as the speech-taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia.

The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353. While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What areas were the introduction of the raccoon a success? from the following article ? As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile).

In the context of the Bacon Explosion, these two key ingredients showcase the ultimate celebration of rich and savory flavors found in American cuisine. The making of a Bacon Explosion involves intricately weaving strips of bacon into a lattice pattern, which then forms the outer layer of this delicious dish. The bacon weave is viewed as both an artistic expression and a functional technique, which allows the dish to hold its shape during the cooking process. Layered within this weave is a layer of flavorful sausage meat, the second main ingredient. This sausage layer serves as a complementary flavor profile to the crispy bacon exterior, with its tender and juicy texture providing a harmonious balance to this carnivorous delight. The Bacon Explosion is often seasoned with a blend of spices and flavors, which may include barbecue rubs, chopped onions, minced garlic, and even jalapeno peppers. Some variations of the dish also involve incorporating cheese, herbs, or other ingredients to further enhance the overall taste experience. As a whole, this dish embodies the spirit of American innovation, creativity, and love for bold and satisfying flavors. The Bacon Explosion, with its roots in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the United States, represents a testament to the diverse and experimental nature of American cuisine. Showcased in its pairing of bacon and sausage, the dish encompasses the rich and robust flavors that continue to entice food lovers of all backgrounds. This dish is a prime example of how classic ingredients can be combined in innovative ways, forging a culinary experience that transcends regional boundaries and reflects the essence of American cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack's life and he's tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown.

Question: If children are raised Ashkenazi, what group is the woman from? Context: In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism.

A lot of so-called college football experts predicted a second straight losing season for embattled head coach Tyrone Willingham and the Notre Dame football team this fall.

It specifically mentions that these experts expect the team to have another losing season under Willingham's leadership, which would be their second consecutive one. To better understand the context, let's break down the key components of the text: 1. College football experts: These are individuals who possess extensive knowledge and expertise in the field of college football. They could be journalists, analysts, former players, or coaches who provide opinions, analysis, and predictions about college football teams, players, and coaches. In this case, these experts have made predictions about the performance of Notre Dame football team and their head coach, Tyrone Willingham. 2. Second straight losing season: A \\"losing season\\" in sports is when a team ends the regular season with more losses than wins. The text suggests that the experts predict Notre Dame to endure another losing season, which means they had a losing season the previous year as well. 3. Embattled head coach Tyrone Willingham: Tyrone Willingham is the head coach of the Notre Dame football team at the time this text refers to, and he is described as \\"embattled.\\" This term implies that he has faced significant challenges, criticism, and perhaps pressure from various stakeholders for the team's poor performance. The fact that experts predict another losing season for the team indicates their belief that Willingham might be unable to turn the team's fortunes around, which could further jeopardize his position as head coach. 4. Notre Dame football team: This is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame, a private Catholic research university located in Notre Dame, Indiana. The football team has a storied history and a passionate fan base, making any predictions about their performance a topic of interest for many followers of college football. In summary, the text is discussing the expectations and predictions of college football experts that the Notre Dame football team, led by their embattled head coach Tyrone Willingham, is likely to have a second consecutive losing season.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many different players caught TD passes?","completion":"Title: Discovering the Number of Different Players Catching Touchdown Passes Hey little buddies! Today, we're going to talk about football and learn how many different players can catch touchdown passes. Touchdowns are an exciting part of the game, and it's so much fun to see players run, jump, and catch the ball. Before we dive in, let's learn some cool words that are used in football. A touchdown pass is when the quarterback throws the ball to a player who catches it in the end zone. This scores 6 points for the team. The quarterback is the team leader who decides which play to run and throws the ball to other players. The end zone is the special part at each end of the field where players try to take the ball to score points. Now, back to our main question: How many different players can catch touchdown passes? Well, it depends on the game you're watching and the team that's playing. In a football team, there are several positions of players who can catch these passes: 1. Wide Receivers: These are the fastest players who run far and wide to catch the ball thrown by the quarterback. They can score many touchdowns because they are quick and have great hands for catching. 2. Tight Ends: These players are a mix of speedy runners like wide receivers and strong blockers like offensive linemen. They line up next to the offensive linemen and can either help block or run out to catch the ball for a touchdown. 3. Running Backs: These players usually carry the ball and run with it, but they can also catch passes from the quarterback. They can surprise the other team by catching the ball and running into the end zone for a touchdown. 4. Full Backs: These players are similar to running backs, but they focus more on blocking. Sometimes, they can also catch passes and score touchdowns if the other team is not expecting it. In a single game of football, all of these players might have a chance to catch touchdown passes! But the number of different players who actually catch a touchdown pass will vary depending on the team's strategy, the skill of the individual players, and how the game unfolds. So, little buddies, the answer to your question is: There is no exact number for how many different players can catch touchdown passes in one game. It varies from game to game and depends on the team playing. But the fun part is that many players can have a chance to catch the ball and score for their teams! I hope you enjoyed learning about football and touchdown passes.

News of the deadly Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured 178 others Monday has understandably dominated CNN's coverage this week. You can follow the live updates here, as events unfold. Two men believed to be suspects in the case have been identified. One died of injuries suffered during a confrontation with police Friday, and the other was arrested after a standoff with police, causing jubilation in Boston. But while all eyes were on the Boston suburb of Watertown, there was plenty going on elsewhere. Here are five stories you may have missed:. 1. A deadly wave of bombings blasted Iraq Tuesday, ahead of elections there Saturday. The attacks took place in at least six provinces: Baghdad, Anbar, Babel, Kirkuk, Salaheddin Diyala, and Nasriya, police officials across the country told CNN. Shiite neighborhoods, police checkpoints and political offices were among the targets. At least 42 people were killed, with more than 257 others wounded. 2. The founder of the French company that made controversial breast implants, went on trial over the scandal. Proceedings against Jean Claude Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, and four others connected to the company continued Thursday, a day after the trial opened in Marseille. Mas was arrested in January 2012 in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his products were perfectly safe. 3. A powerful earthquake struck Pakistan's border with Iran, Tuesday, killing 34 people and injuring 80 others in Pakistan, sources say. Officials earlier said that dozens more were injured in both countries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was preliminarily measured at 7.8 magnitude. The Iranian Seismological Center said the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5. Army doctors and Frontier Corps paramilitary forces took part in rescue efforts in Mashakel, according to a Pakistani official involved in relief efforts. 4. A Pakistani court confined the country's former president Pervez Musharraf to his home Friday. The move came a day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court after a judge revoked his bail. The development is the latest legal setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month, five years after he resigned as president and left the country, to fight a series of court cases against him. He had been seeking to run in upcoming elections. 5. New Zealand's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Wednesday. The country became the first in the Asia Pacific region to pass the legislation, ahead of Australia, whose gay community feels the country is falling behind in terms of gay rights. The New Zealand Parliament passed the bill by a convincing margin of 77 votes to 44, amending the Marriage Act to permit gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex couples to marry. Overjoyed supporters of the legislation in the public gallery burst into song in celebration. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

The small child is standing near a large tree. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: 1. There is a small child. 2. The small child stands by a tree. Comparing the details mentioned in both premise and hypothesis, we can notice some similarities and differences. The similarities are: both involve the presence of a small child, and both mention the child standing by or near a tree. The difference is in the details about the small child's attire (turquoise shorts) and the specific detail about the tree being large, which are mentioned in the premise but not in the hypothesis. The hypothesis omits these specific details and focuses on the broad idea of a small child standing by a tree. We can conclude that if the premise is true (the small child with turquoise shorts standing near a large tree), the broad idea mentioned in the hypothesis (a small child stands by a tree) is also true. The hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise, focusing on the essential elements and ignoring the specific details (turquoise shorts and large tree).

Question: when president nixon resigns? Would \\"Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, the statement \\"Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question of when President Nixon resigned. It does, however, provide important information about President Nixon's foreign policy achievements during his time in office. To answer the question, President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, due to the Watergate scandal that enveloped his presidency. Watergate was a political scandal involving President Nixon's administration, which was caught in illegal activities such as wiretapping and breaking into the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. The scandal that followed led to a series of investigations, and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Nixon for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. Fearing almost certain impeachment by the full House of Representatives and probable conviction by the Senate, Nixon decided to resign from his position as the 37th president of the United States. He is the only U.S. president in history to have resigned from office. His vice president, Gerald Ford, was sworn in as the 38th president and later pardoned Nixon for any crimes he may have committed during his presidency. In conclusion, President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, due to the Watergate scandal. The provided statement about Nixon's foreign policy accomplishments is not directly related to the question but illustrates some of the prominent achievements of his presidency before the Watergate scandal overshadowed his legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The negative keyword is weaker in sentiment compared to the positive ones. 4. Consider the context of the negative keyword: The \\"not a masterpiece\\" does not seem to be entirely negative, as the sentence continues with \\"but because it convinced me.\\" This suggests that although the film may not have been a perfect work of art, it still evoked positive emotions due to the growth of Portuguese cinema.

Answer:","completion":"To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the primary function of a wasp's stinger and the role it plays in the wasp's survival. (I). Produce eggs - While wasps use their stingers to lay eggs in some cases, the poison within the stinger isn't directly involved in producing eggs. (II). Defend itself - This is the primary purpose of a wasp's stinger, as it injects venom into its target to deter predators and protect the wasp or its nest. (III). Build a nest - Wasps don't use their stingers to build their nests; instead, they use materials like wood pulp and mud. (IV). Attract a mate - A wasp's stinger doesn't play a role in attracting a mate, as wasps usually rely on chemical signals called pheromones to communicate with one another. Considering the primary function of a wasp's stinger, the correct answer is: Answer: (II). defend itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity.

Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). Following the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst its saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing its new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. Meteora features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003 and instantly earned worldwide recognition, going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia. Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album's singles, including \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Breaking the Habit\\", \\"Faint\\", and \\"Numb\\", received significant radio attention. By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three million copies. The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year and Pia. Meteora earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and the Viewer's Choice Award for \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year (\\"Numb\\") awards. Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid Theory, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts. At the same time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust and financial issues.

It covers an area of 113 sq km. It is surrounded by water on three sides and overlooked by the Coast Range. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada. Temperatures average 3degC in January and 18degC in July. Vancouver's most rainfall occurs in winter. Archaeological evidence shows that coastal Indians had settled the Vancouver area by 500 BC. British naval captain George Vancouver explored the area in 1792. Vancouver was founded as a sawmill settlement called Granville in the 1870s. The city was united in 1886 and renamed after Captain Vancouver. As the main western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is the primary city of western Canada, as well as one of the nation's largest industrial centers. The Port of Vancouver is Canada's largest and most various port, trading more than 43 billion in goods with more than 90 trading economies annually. Port activities generate 69,200 jobs in total with 4 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.9 billion in economic output. Vancouver is a major tourist place.

Roberta Adams skipped the thick how-to guide on child-custody forms and sat down at a computer at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange on Wednesday. The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about 800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library. The program is also available online. Bob Cohen, executive director of Legal Aid, said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout California. Locally, a program for divorce petitions will be added this summer. Cohen said the system proves the benefit of technology tailored to those who aren't computer-savvy. He said much of the technology now available requires Internet skills and access. Low-income people, however, have less access to computers and less experience using them. \\"Our clients have to catch up, and they have to become a part of the mainstream,\\" Cohen said.

Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife. The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \\" Are you standing or sitting?\\" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \\"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground. In such a critical state as he was then, his thought still went to me...\\" The old lady concluded slowly, \\"That's the sweetest whisper of love I've ever heard all my life.\\" A loud applause followed in the wake of a short silence.

Czech is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic by approximately 10.7 million people, and it is also spoken by Czech communities around the world.

It is a question asking if someone is secretly watching or investigating someone or something. This term is often used in various contexts, ranging from casual conversations to serious situations involving surveillance and privacy. Czech, like other Slavic languages, has a rich and complex grammar system, with seven cases for nouns and adjectives, including nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Additionally, Czech verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, voice, person, and number, making the language quite complex for learners. The Czech alphabet is based on the Latin script and includes some unique letters with diacritical marks, such as \\"č,\\" \\"š,\\" and \\"ž,\\" which represent distinct consonant sounds. These characters, along with the specific pronunciation rules, give the Czech language its unique sound and phonetic qualities. The Czech language has a long literary and linguistic tradition, with some of its earliest written records dating back to the 11th century. Over the years, the Czech language has developed and evolved, absorbing loanwords from Latin, German, and other languages, while also creating new compounds and expressions to reflect modern societal and technological advancements. Today, Czech is known for its rich vocabulary, complexity, and distinctive pronunciation, making it an important part of the Slavic cultural and linguistic heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun.

Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle.

Summarize this article: As they chipped away at a wall inside a tunnel of the Clinton Correctional Facility last spring, David Sweat and Richard Matt had the Hollywood movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" on their minds. The film tells the story of convicted murderer Andy Dufresne, who spends nearly two decades using a rock hammer to dig a tunnel out of his cell. The parallels were not lost on Sweat and Matt, who were trying to make their own escape. State police are looking for 48-year-old Richard Matt, left, and 34-year-old David Sweat after troopers say they escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility. New York State Police \\"We were laughing and joking about how Andy did it in 20 years. I think we might be able to do it in 10,\\" Sweat later told investigators. Weeks later, Sweat and Matt were on the lam in one of the nation's most brazen breakouts. They spent three weeks running in upstate New York before Matt was killed and Sweat was wounded and captured. Now, almost a year later, New York's inspector general has released a scathing report full of new details about Matt and Sweat's plot and the systemic security failures that allowed them to succeed.

To compile the report, investigators obtained sworn testimony from Sweat, who spent 85 nights cutting an escape path in the system of catwalks and tunnels behind cell walls, using tools smuggled in by prison seamstress Joyce Mitchell. Matt, he said, joined him in the tunnels for two nights of work before they finally made a break for it on June 5. Stealing into the tunnels after 11 p.m. guard checks, they left dummies in their beds — and notes for prison staff. \\"You left me no choice but to grow old & die in here. I had to do something,” Matt scrawled on a notepad, according to the report. On a painting he made of fictional mob boss Tony Soprano, he wrote, “Time to Go Kid!” with the date “6-5-15.” Sweat put up messages in the tunnel, meant for their pursuers. One was an image of an extraterrestrial with the note, “Are You Trying Me Punk?” Notes left behind by David Sweat and Richard Matt when they escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 5, 2015. NY State Police Correction officers didn't discover they were gone until after 5 a.m. Officer Ronald Blair described the moment he spotted the two darkened cells, shook the beds, and then pulled off the sheets to see the dummies instead of the prisoners. \\"I almost threw up,\\" Blair said, according to the report. Sweat told authorities that when he and Matt clambered out of the tunnel through a manhole just after midnight, he felt a sense of triumph that once again reminded him of a certain movie. \\"Shawshank ain't got s--- on me,\\" he said. ||||| The web archive collection relating to Purdue University, its schools, colleges, and administrative units.

This chore helps ensure that the kitchen remains organized, which in turn makes meal preparation more efficient and pleasant. Furthermore, promptly cleaning dirty dishes helps to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold, as well as the spread of potential foodborne illnesses. To effectively wash dishes, follow these steps: 1. Preparation: Begin by removing any leftover food from the dishes. Scrape the food scraps into a compost bin or trash can. Stack the dishes by size and type, such as plates, bowls, and glasses, to make cleaning more manageable. If there are any particularly difficult food remnants, soak the dishes in warm, soapy water for several minutes before washing. 2. Fill the sink with water: Fill the sink with warm to hot water, and mix in some mild dish soap to create suds. Alternatively, you can use a plastic basin or tub if you don't have a sink available. 3. Wash: Using a dishcloth or sponge, scrub each dish thoroughly, making sure to remove any food debris and grease. Be gentle on delicate surfaces to prevent scratching. For stubborn grime or burned-on food, soaking the dish in warm soapy water may be helpful, or you can use a non-abrasive scrubbing pad or brush. 4. Rinse: Rinse each dish under warm water to remove soap residue. Make sure there are no suds left on the dishes, as they can leave a soapy taste on the dishes. 5. Dry: You can either air-dry the dishes by placing them on a drying rack or dry them with a clean, dry dish towel. Make sure to store the dishes properly afterward to maintain cleanliness and organization. By selecting the most suitable option, washing dishes, and following these steps, you can effectively address a kitchen with dishes astray and promote a clean, organized, and hygienic environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions, along with justifications for each step. 1. Gather ingredients: - 1 cup of uncooked long-grain white rice - 2 cups of water - 1 tablespoon of olive oil - 1 small onion, finely chopped - 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped - 2 cloves of garlic, minced - 1 (15-ounce) can of black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed - 1 teaspoon of salt - 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper - 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional) - 2 cups of cooked, shredded ham or bacon (Justification: Gathering all ingredients before you start prepares you for the cooking process while ensuring you have everything you need.) 2. Cook the rice: - Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan and add the uncooked rice. Lower the heat to simmer, cover, and cook for about 18-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and has absorbed the water. Then set aside. (Justification: This step ensures that the rice is cooked separately, which helps to prevent it from becoming mushy when combined with the other ingredients.) 3. Prepare the vegetables: - While the rice is cooking, finely chop the onion and green bell pepper, as well as mince the garlic. (Justification: Prepping the vegetables in advance streamlines the process and ensures they are evenly distributed in the dish.) 4. Sauté the vegetables: - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, green bell pepper, and garlic, and sauté for 5-7 minutes, or until the onions become translucent and the bell peppers are softened. (Justification: Sautéing the vegetables in olive oil brings out their flavors and helps to ensure even cooking.) 5. Add the black-eyed peas, cooked rice, and seasonings: - To the skillet with the sautéed vegetables, add the cooked rice, black-eyed peas, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Stir well to combine and cook for 3-4 minutes on medium-low heat, allowing the flavors to meld. (Justification: Combining these ingredients at this stage ensures that all ingredients mix well and the seasonings are equally distributed.) 6. Add the cooked ham or bacon: - Lastly, stir in the cooked shredded ham or bacon and cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated through. (Justification: Adding the cooked meat at the end ensures that it absorbs the flavors of the dish and gets heated through.) 7. Serve the Hoppin' John rice: - Serve the dish hot, garnished with chopped green onions or parsley if desired. (Justification: Serving the Hoppin' John rice hot enhances the taste and texture of the dish, while optional garnishing adds to its presentation.)"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What's the answer to that question: what is yale university mascot?

I didn't need to read the findings of a recent Australian research study to know that most women who live with their mates have more body fat than those who don't. For 10 years, researchers studied nearly 6,500 women, age 18 to 23, and found, according to one of the study's authors, Dr. Wendy J. Brown, that \\"Women with no partner and no baby averaged 11 pounds over 10 years. With a partner and no baby they gained about 15 pounds, and if they had a partner and a baby they gained 20 pounds.\\" (The findings appear in the February issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.) Researchers can speculate on the reasons for this, but it's not news to me. Of the thousands of women I've met who are desperately seeking to reshape their bodies, almost all are living with -- or just moved away from -- a partner. While I have heard many voices, their story is the same: They lust, then love. With lust comes starvation; with love, over-consumption and under-exercise. Their love transforms from the physical to the emotional, and this usually happens after they decide to live together. But once they lift their heads above the fog of love, they look down to find that their butts are sagging, bellies are bulging and thighs have taken on interesting new shapes! Come to think of it, many of the men who knock on my door looking for their abdominal muscles also deteriorated soon after moving in with their mates. Think about your man. Does he have the same waistline measurement as when you first signed the lease or mortgage papers? Probably not. In fact, it probably got even worse for both of you after your first child, didn't it? (The new Australian research references an earlier study that showed an increase in obesity in men once they'd had children.) Like the smokers I know, the overwhelming majority of whom hate to smoke, many women develop unhealthy patterns (like snacking on junk food at home) that lead to unhealthy bodies, which lead to a seriously unhealthy lack of self-esteem. We become \\"less desirable,\\" a phrase I hear far too often. Once we arrive at this place, the frantic search begins. Many of us will do anything to recover what was once our youthful body. Sadly, many waste time and money on fad diets, pills and potions. They end up doing the yo-yo thing, torturing their bodies through obsessive experimentation with an endless list of exercise programs, almost all of which fail them, because the will to really change behavior is not yet there. So, what can we do? First, we must think about the quality and standards of our everyday behavior more than the end result. If we can just focus on gradual improvement of our diet and our exercise programs, we will likely regain our healthier, slimmer form. But more important, we will also build our self-respect. So, taking intelligent steps (i.e., coming up with a rational workout plan or shopping for fresher and healthier foods and eating them, not impulse snacks), carrying the steps out consistently -- more frequently and for a longer duration -- will have a huge net benefit on our bottoms and our bottom line: love. Next, we should include our mates in our process. In my experience, for example, couples who work out together have greater success in achieving their health and weight loss goals. They also seem to get along much better and stay together longer. Transform your personal physical development time into \\"date time,\\" doing something as simple as taking regular after-dinner walks together. Finally, cut back, but don't cut out the fun stuff. When we are consistent with our diet and exercise programs, there is no need for maniacal starvation. We don't need to sit at the dinner table with a radish on our plate, while our children and mates enjoy full meals. A healthy diet should not be some kind of intruder in our relationships, it should be a natural part of our lives. Besides, fun foods are what make our love lives more interesting and memorable. So eat! But only if you do the work on the other side of those calories. Having a healthy, fit and feminine physique and a deeply loving emotional relationship are not mutually exclusive. You can have both; and it can be done in a fun and positive way. For those of you about to move in, heed this advice: Start your program now, before your belly and your mate's interest start to sag! I promise: if you don't quit, you'll have a body that won't quit! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tracy Anderson. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the findings of an Australian research study that showed women with partners and children tend to gain more weight than those without.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. I am facing a new situation today: Two farmers had different pests attacking their plants. John had a big aphid problem, so he used all the methods available to get rid of them.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. But I can use this background: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. What is an answer for this question: Would bottle B milk need or not need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd?","completion":"To answer the question of whether or not bottle B milk would need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd, we first need to understand the different types of milk involved in this experiment and the process of making curd. As mentioned, bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, while bottle C milk is just raw milk. Pasteurization is a heat treatment applied to milk, which kills most of the bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria that are naturally present in raw milk. Raw milk, on the other hand, contains a diverse microbial population which includes lactic acid bacteria that can cause milk to sour and curdle over time. In Dan's experiment, he is making curd out of bottle B (pasteurized) and bottle C (raw) milk. Since bottle A milk is not being used for making curd, it is not relevant to the question. Now, focusing on bottle B milk, which is pasteurized, the process of pasteurization kills most of the bacteria including the natural lactic acid bacteria. When making curds, it is the presence of lactic acid bacteria that helps in the coagulation of milk proteins (casein) into solid masses, or curds. Since the pasteurization of bottle B milk significantly reduces the number of naturally present lactic acid bacteria, it would be necessary to add lactic acid bacteria to start the coagulation process and produce curd. There are a few different ways to reintroduce lactic acid bacteria into bottle B milk: 1. Inoculating with a store-bought or homemade starter culture containing lactic acid bacteria, like yogurt or bacterial cultures specifically designed for cheesemaking. 2. Adding a small amount of raw milk containing active lactic acid bacteria to the pasteurized milk. 3. Leaving the pasteurized milk to sit at room temperature and allowing the limited amount of remaining lactic acid bacteria to multiply, naturally souring, and curdling the milk (although this method is less reliable and might lead to inconsistent curd formation). In conclusion, bottle B milk, being pasteurized, would need added lactic acid bacteria to initiate the process of curd formation effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. But I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. What is an answer for this question: Which group has a greater chance of getting more health problems?","completion":"To answer the question of which group has a greater chance of getting more health problems, let's analyze the information provided and compare the two groups. Step 1: Understand the dietary habits of both groups Group Brown: Ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months Group Yellow: Had a normal diet Step 2: Consider the background information given - Any unused energy in food (carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids) is stored in the body as fat. - An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat - Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m² or greater - Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension Step 3: Determine the impact of extra calories on Group Brown Since Group Brown is consuming 3500 extra calories per day, they will likely gain 1 pound of body fat per day as a result (based on the 3500 extra calories = 1 pound of fat rule). Over the course of 3 months (approximately 90 days), Group Brown would gain about 90 pounds of body fat, which is likely to increase their BMI significantly, putting them at a higher risk of becoming obese. Step 4: Compare the two groups Group Brown would most likely experience a significant increase in BMI due to this excessive calorie intake. On the other hand, Group Yellow is maintaining a normal diet, which means they are much less likely to experience a drastic increase in BMI. Step 5: Conclude which group has a greater chance of more health problems Given the information provided, Group Brown, which followed a diet with a daily intake of 3500 extra calories, would have a greater chance of getting more health problems related to obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Destiny's Child was an American girl group whose final and best-known line-up comprised Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. Formed in 1997 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990, comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett among others. After years of limited success, the quartet were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the number-one singles \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" and \\"Say My Name\\". In 1990, Beyonce Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while auditioning for a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that performed rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Tamar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R&B producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing. Because of the group's defeat, Knowles' father, Mathew, voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them. Mathew Knowles decided to cut the original lineup to four, with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993. Aside from spending time at their church in Houston, Girl's Tyme practiced in their backyards and at Headliners Salon, owned by Knowles' mother, Tina. The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try out would be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl's Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a \\"boot camp\\" to train them in dance and vocal lessons. After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established R&B groups of that time such as SWV, Dru Hill and Immature. Tina Knowles designed the group's attire for their performances. Over the course of the early years in their career, Girl's Tyme changed their name to Something Fresh, Cliche, the Dolls, and to Destiny. The group signed with Elektra Records with the name Destiny, but were dropped several months later before they could release an album. The pursuit of a record deal affected the Knowles family: in 1995, Mathew Knowles resigned from his job as a medical-equipment salesman, a move that reduced Knowles' family's income by half, and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure. In 1996, they changed their name to Destiny's Child, which was taken from a passage in the Book of Isaiah. Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records, which signed the group that same year. Prior to signing with Columbia, the group had recorded several tracks in Oakland, California produced by D'wayne Wiggins of Tony! Toni!

Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served?

The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157. The album entered the UK album chart at number-three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.\\"Sat in Your Lap\\" was the first single from the album to be released.

Plot title: Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him. Grimble... My question: What is Soren? The answer is:","completion":"Soren is a young barn owl and the main protagonist in the movie \\"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole.\\" He lives in the Tyto Forest with his family and enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones."},{"prompt":"Information: - A symptom (from Greek , \\"accident, misfortune, that which befalls\\", from , \\"I befall\\", from - \\"together, with\\" and , \\"I fall\\") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. - The members of Triatominae , a subfamily of Reduviidae, are also known as conenose bugs, kissing bugs, assassin bugs, or vampire bugs. Other local names for them used in the Latin Americas include barbeiros, vinchucas, pitos and chinches. Most of the 130 or more species of this subfamily are haematophagous, i.e. feeds on vertebrate blood; a very few species feed on other invertebrates (Sandoval \\"et al.\\" 2000, 2004). They are mainly found and widespread in the Americas, with a few species present in Asia, Africa, and Australia. These bugs usually share shelter with nesting vertebrates, from which they suck blood. In areas where Chagas disease occurs (from the southern United States to northern Argentina), all triatomine species are potential vectors of the Chagas disease parasite \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\", but only those species (such as \\"Triatoma infestans\\" and \\"Rhodnius prolixus\\") that are well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors. - Carlos Justiniano Ribeiro Chagas , or Carlos Chagas ( Portuguese : ( kaluutninu ibeju a ) , ( kalua ) ; 1879 -- 1934 ) , was a Brazilian sanitary physician , scientist and bacteriologist who worked as a clinician and researcher . He discovered Chagas disease , also called American trypanosomiasis in 1909 , while working at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro . Chagas ' work holds a unique place in the history of medicine . Working in primitive conditions , Chagas described in detail a previously unknown infectious disease : its pathogen , vector ( Triatominae ) , host , clinical manifestations and epidemiology . Chagas was also the first to discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis , later infamous for being linked to PCP ( Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients ) . - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - A medic is an umbrella term for a person involved in medicine. The following fall under this term: a physician, paramedic, medical student, and sometimes a medically-trained individual participating in the role of a medic such as an emergency medical responder. - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths. - A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatmentthe \\"science\\" of medicineand also a decent competence in its applied practicethe art or \\"craft\\" of medicine. - Heart failure (HF), often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise, while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the functioning of the heart. There are two main types of heart failure: \\"heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction\\" and \\"heart failure with normal ejection fraction\\" depending on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected, or the heart's ability to relax. The severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as myocardial infarction (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease. The condition is diagnosed based on the history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular... - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host. - Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz, better known as Oswaldo Cruz (August 5, 1872 in São Luís do Paraitinga, São Paulo province, Brazil February 11, 1917 in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro state), was a Brazilian physician, bacteriologist, epidemiologist and public health officer and the founder of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. - Pathology (from the Greek roots of \\"pathos\\", meaning \\"experience\\" or \\"suffering\\", and \\"-logia\\", \\"study of\\") is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis. - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the bloodbrain barrier, bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain. - Public health refers to \\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\" It is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). The dimensions of health can encompass \\"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\\" as defined by the United Nations' World Health Organization. Public health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, insurance medicine, mental health and occupational safety and health are other important subfields. - A parasitic disease, also known as parasitosis, is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. Many parasites do not cause diseases. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals. The study of parasitic diseases is called parasitology. - Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired (\\"secondary\\") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone. Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer immunosurveillance, in which the immune system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones. - Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental or social changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\" This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word \\"complete\\". Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. - Autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an autoimmune disease. Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis (PM), and dermatomyositis (DM). Autoimmune diseases are very often treated with steroids. - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox...

A herbal may also classify the plants it describes, may give recipes for herbal extracts, tinctures, or potions, and sometimes include mineral and animal medicaments in addition to those obtained from plants. Herbals were often illustrated to assist plant identification. - A tincture is typically an alcoholic extract of plant or animal material or solution of such, or of a low volatility substance (such as iodine and mercurochrome). To qualify as an alcoholic tincture, the extract should have an ethanol percentage of at least 2560% (50120 US proof). Sometimes an alcohol concentration as high as 90% (180 US proof) is used in such a tincture. In herbal medicine, alcoholic tinctures are made with various ethanol concentrations, 25% being the most common. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.

Comparing this to the other possible answers: 1. House: Fire extinguishers are typically found in multiple areas of a house, such as the kitchen or garage, but they are not commonly kept behind a seat. 2. Garden: Gardens are often open outdoor spaces, and it would be uncommon to find a fire extinguisher behind a seat in this location. 3. Stairwell: In buildings, fire extinguishers are likely to be found mounted on walls in stairwells rather than behind a seat. 4. Garage: While fire extinguishers can be kept in a garage for fire safety, it is not specifically associated with being found behind the seat.

Article: If your arms are wet or sweaty when you apply your deodorant or antiperspirant, it’s not going to work as well and stains are more likely to form. Wipe off any moisture underneath your arms before applying deodorant or antiperspirant, and let the application dry completely. It’s common to think that applying more deodorant or antiperspirant will help you smell or sweat less, but this isn’t necessarily the case. It’s much better to apply an even layer that is thin and controlled. Don’t apply too much, as this can cause stains. Research has shown that it's possible for your body to become immune to your antiperspirant after several months. So if you're frustrated by your deodorant or antiperspirant because it doesn't seem to be working anymore, try switching it up and trying out a different one. You can always go back to your favorite after a few months. If you find yourself constantly sweating and are looking for a better solution, think about trying a prescription deodorant or antiperspirant. These still have lots of aluminum, but they’re less likely to ruin your day-time clothes because you apply the prescription at night. The prescription will most likely cause a bit of damage to your sleepwear, so throw on an old t-shirt or nightgown before going to bed. Many deodorants have aluminum in them, which helps you sweat less. However, the aluminum causes the sweat that you do produce to leave more prominent stains on your clothing. By switching to a natural deodorant or antiperspirant, you’ll avoid all of the harmful chemicals that are in regular deodorants and help prevent stains as well. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses the proper application and use of deodorants and antiperspirants to minimize staining on clothes and maintain their effectiveness. It suggests wiping off moisture before application, applying a thin and even layer, considering a periodic change of product to avoid immunity, and trying prescription alternatives for excessive sweating. Additionally, the article highlights that using natural deodorants can help avoid harmful chemicals and prevent stains due to the absence of aluminum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism? is inside the article: At this point Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: \\"Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book\\". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\\". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the \\"Reds\\" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the \\"Whites\\" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\"In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February.

Translate to English","completion":"\\"Investment policy must also take into account the priorities of the European Union's foreign policy.\\" In the context of investment policy, it is essential to consider the priorities of the European Union's (EU) foreign policy. The EU is a political and economic union that consists of 27 member countries, and its external actions are governed by a set of shared goals and principles established in various treaties and documents, including the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Global Strategy for the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy. These priorities primarily aim to foster peace, security, and prosperity for the EU and its neighbors while promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law worldwide. Some of the EU's foreign policy priorities include: 1. Peace and Security: The EU works to ensure stability in its neighborhood, particularly in the Western Balkans and the Eastern neighborhood. It addresses crises and conflicts through diplomacy, sanctions, and, if necessary, military or civilian operations. The EU also supports global disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives. 2. Trade and Economic Diplomacy: The EU is a major trading partner, and its foreign policy seeks to create a level playing field for its businesses and industries on the international stage. EU trade policy aims to promote fair trade, sustainable development, and investment to create jobs and economic growth. 3. Development Cooperation: The EU provides development aid to countries in need to support initiatives that focus on sustainable development, poverty reduction, and long-term peace and stability. This includes funding programs in areas such as education, healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure. 4. Climate Change and Environmental Protection: As the world faces the growing challenges of climate change, the EU actively participates in international negotiations and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support clean energy transition. 5. Human Rights and Democracy: Upholding human rights, the rule of law, and democratic principles is a cornerstone of the EU's external actions, and it supports these values through various policy and funding instruments, including its partnerships with international organizations like the United Nations. In shaping an investment policy, the interests of the European Union's foreign policy must be taken into account to ensure that investments contribute to these goals and do not undermine them. This means that investors and policymakers should consider the potential social, economic, and political impact of their investments on the stability of the regions, as well as how investments might align with the EU's broader objectives such as promoting human rights, sustainable development, and climate change mitigation or adaptation. In summary, it is vital to analyze and understand the priorities of the European Union's foreign policy framework when developing an investment policy. Considering these priorities can contribute to securing long-term stability and growth for all parties involved and strengthen the bonds between nations and regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Mitt Romney's aides announced amid the Newt Gingrich campaign breakdown that he'll be skipping the Ames Straw Poll, a crucial test of organizational strength in Iowa and an event he spent a hefty 1 million on in 2007, only to lose the caucuses. Mitt Romney's aides have done a delicate dance managing expectations about how strongly he'll play in Iowa, and the argument against competing at Ames for him is his already-high name recognition and current poll standing in the state. To lose at Ames would raise doubts about his grassroots support and create a real perception problem. He's also still planning on taking part in a Fox News debate scheduled shortly before the straw poll, and has said he'll compete in the caucuses. He also has staff muscle in Iowa, and he's skipping a Florida straw poll as well. The dwindling number of potential anti-Romneys in the field clearly makes it an easier option for him. But it's also designed to dampen the significance of the event, which will be a springboard to a candidate from the right who could take on Romney. It was less than two weeks ago, while in Arkeny, that Romney said he was \\"committed\\" to the process, but he hedged about whether he'd take part in Ames. In spinning his decision, Romney will be confronted by his own 2007 statements in which he held up Rudy Giuliani and John McCain's absence from the straw poll as a sign that they were not as sufficiently committed to the Iowa as him. \\"If you're going to participate in the Iowa process, then you better get in the straw poll,\\" he said four years ago. Romney opponents will ask why that process apparently doesn't include Ames for him any longer. Tim Pawlenty's team seized on the announcement. \\"The Ames straw poll is a great gathering of conservatives, and Governor Pawlenty's solid record will be well received there,\\" was the cheery statement from Iowa Steering Committee Chairman Matt Whitaker. \\"I look forward to joining thousands of Iowans in casting my vote for Governor Pawlenty in Ames this summer and in the caucuses this winter.\\" Republican Party of Iowa chairman Matt Strawn was clearly displeased, but made a relatively mild statement saying, \\"I’ll leave it to the pundits and voters to assess the wisdom of skipping an event of tremendous importance to tens of thousands of Iowa Republicans and caucus-goers.\\" Strawn, who has been fighting to try to keep the caucuses relevant in picking the eventual nominee, predicted Ames will still be a success. Team Romney put out a string of statements to defend the decision, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. \\"Our campaign has made the decision to not participate in any straw polls, whether it’s in Florida, Iowa, Michigan or someplace else,\\" said campaign manager Matt Rhoades, insisting this was a decision about directing resources, something Romney's campaign isn't lacking. The campaign also put out statements praising his decision from former party chairs-turned-supporters, including former Iowa GOP chairman Brian Kennedy, saying, \\"The campaign is making a smart decision to not to compete in the upcoming series of straw polls. Mitt’s focus is on winning the nomination, not the straw polls. Mitt will be back in Iowa this summer and will participate in the Ames debate.” However, if a frontrunner bypassed Ames when Kennedy was chairman, his statement at the time would probably have been more like Strawn's. ||||| « Previous | Main | Next » Mitt Romney Bows Out of Iowa Straw Poll to Focus Resources Elsewhere ABC News' Emily Friedman reports: Presidential candidate Mitt Romney will not attend the Iowa Straw Poll this August, an event long known to be one of the first indicators of how a campaign might fair in the crucial Hawkeye State. And Romney's aides said tonight that the former governor will not only bow out of the Iowa Straw Poll but will not take part in any straw polls during his campaign, a nod to their vows to run a \\"wiser\\" and \\"leaner\\" campaign this time around. Campaign manager Matt Rhoades said tonight in an email statement, \\"Our campaign has made the decision to not participate in any straw polls, whether it’s in Florida, Iowa, Michigan or someplace else.\\" \\"In the last presidential campaign we were both strengthened as an organization and learned some important lessons by participating in them,\\" wrote Rhoades. \\"This time we will focus our energies and resources on winning primaries and caucuses. We look forward to bringing Mitt Romney’s strong pro-jobs message to every part of the country.\\" In his 2008 White House bid, Romney won the Iowa Straw Poll but was largely criticized for millions of dollars spent to attract voters to the event. Despite the money he spent on the event, Romney later came in second-place in the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Arkansas Republican Mike Huckabee in 2008. So far this campaign Romney has made several remarks indicating that his campaign will use their resources more sparingly. Romney will still participate in the Fox News debate scheduled to be held in Ames on August 11, just days before the straw poll. Statements by former GOP chairmen in Michigan, Iowa and Florida released by the Romney campaign tonight lauded the presidential hopeful's decision to focus his resources on other campaign efforts and not straw polls. \\"The campaign is making a smart decision to not compete in the upcoming series of straw polls,\\" said Brian Kennedy, former Iowa GOP Chair. \\"Mitt's focus is on winning the nomination, not the straw polls.\\" Former Florida GOP Chairman John Trasher added, \\"The campaign's decision to not participate in any straw polls makes strategic sense. Florida is an expensive state to campaign in. As a candidate that has already proven his organization strength and support in Florida, it's smart for him to focus his time and resources on winning the actual primary.\\" Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn seemed less pleased about Romney's decision in his own release in which he wrote, \\"I’ll leave it to the pundits and voters to assess the wisdom of skipping an event of tremendous importance to tens of thousands of Iowa Republicans and caucusgoers.” “More than ever, Iowa Republicans are energized and motivated to utilize the Ames Straw Poll as a catalyst toward building a 99-county organization to deny President Obama a second term,\\" said Strawn. Romney's announcement that he will not attend the straw poll in Iowa later this summer comes on the heels of a multi-stop trip to the state late last month, during which he spoke at length about how much he values Iowa voters. “You’ll have plenty of opportunity to see me,” Romney said in May. “I care about Iowa.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Mitt Romney's aides have announced that he will be skipping the Ames Straw Poll, an event he spent 1 million on in 2007.

Agent Orange was a herbicide the US Government used during the Vietnam War to kill foliage making it easier for US Troops to see through the dense jungle canopy. The adverse effects of Agent Orange on our veterans was unknown to them during their service. Now over 400,000 Vietnam vets are suffering from their exposure. Expeditions Orange’s goals during the campaign: To raise national awareness for the issue of Agent Orange exposure and the resulting illnesses. To meet and interview veterans, family members, doctors and experts in regards to Agent Orange and their personal stories. To create a Video Documentary of the ride and interviews which will serve as a tool to help expand outreach, while also serving as a resource tool that Vietnam veterans and their families can use to find assistance. To raise money through the Exhibition Orange 501(c)(3) charitable organization which will be utilized to directly help affected Vietnam veterans receive a proper “Thank You” using the “Make A Wish” model. To honor the stories of the many who have suffered and continue to suffer from the horrors of Agent Orange.

(Associated Press) In this Wednesday, April 19, 2017 photo, Iraq war veteran Colt Romberger pauses behind an American flag hanging from his trailer in Santa Clarita, Calif. Romberger is training his horse for a ride from California to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington in hopes to raise money for veterans causes and... (Associated Press) SANTA CLARITA, California (AP) — The two things Colt Romberger and his father had most in common, the ones that made them best friends as well as father and son, were a deep affection for horses and an equally deep pride in having served their country in times of war. So when Cliff Romberger, a Vietnam War veteran and onetime wrangler of horses on Hollywood film sets, died in 2015 of a brain disease doctors attributed to his exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange, his son knew there was but one way to honor him: He would saddle up his horse and ride it from the Pacific Ocean to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. On Monday the compact, muscular 32-year-old Iraq war veteran will begin that journey through big-city streets, across desert sand and over mountain ranges and prairies, aboard a handsome gray-and-black 4-year-old quarter horse named Gus. Along the way he hopes to accomplish several things: raise money for veterans causes through a nonprofit foundation he's established, tell the public about the devastating, deadly effect the use of Agent Orange is having on thousands of aging bodies of Vietnam veterans and, with stops at town halls across the country, let those veterans know they have not been forgotten. \\"I've spoken to so many Vietnam vets, and they've emailed me. Sometimes it breaks my heart hearing their stories,\\" he says in a voice momentarily choked with emotion. There was the guy in Norfolk, Virginia, who heard of the ride and sent him 200. When Romberger called to thank him he learned the man was dying of a form of leukemia he believed had been caused by Agent Orange but that had not yet been classified as such because there hadn't been enough cases for the Department of Veterans Affairs to study. He was hoping the government could make that connection in time to add his wife to his survivor's benefits. \\"And then he passed away, and he never got the approval,\\" Romberger says quietly as he sits on the patio of a friend's ranch in a semi-rural section of the picturesque suburb of Santa Clarita, 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Los Angeles. Gus is in a pen nearby, playfully grabbing at a large log he's turned into a toy. They've just finished a lengthy endurance ride through surrounding canyons. Colt Romberger has been preparing for this ride for nearly two years, and like all good cowboys, the reserve Pasadena police officer, Air Force reserve intelligence analyst and part-time actor will bring along a sidekick. It's his late father's best friend. \\"He said, 'Kenny, I'm going to do this. You want to go?' I said, 'You bet,' so I told his mom I'll make sure he's taken care of, and so here we are,\\" said Kenny Reichel, who is putting his business restoring antique cars on hold for the six months the ride is expected to take. Reichel will drive a truck carrying supplies and pulling a horse trailer while scouting for places man and horse might bed down for the night. It will pretty much be Gus who sets the pace, Romberger said, adding when the horse gets tired they'll stop. He estimates they can average 25 miles (40 kilometers) a day. \\"The potential of getting injured on this thing is high,\\" he acknowledges. \\"When you're riding on city streets, a horse can spook and get hit by a truck.\\" To prepare, he's been riding Gus through some of the busy streets of Los Angeles and Pasadena. Recently he dropped by the Pasadena Police Department, which has granted him a leave of duty for the ride. \\"I wish I had taken a picture,\\" Police Chief Phillip Sanchez says with a chuckle. \\"Picture the classic Gary Cooper 'High Noon,' right? He's got this brown Stetson hat on, he's wearing a pair of 501 button-down Levi jeans, a pair of brown boots that have probably seen more cow dung than I want to imagine, and spurs of all things.\\" The department \\"couldn't be more proud of him,\\" Sanchez adds, and will be following his ride on social media. Veterans Affairs has recognized more than a dozen diseases it presumes to be connected with exposure to Agent Orange, the defoliant sprayed on the Vietnam countryside to eliminate ground cover hiding enemy troops. After learning how toxic it was, the U.S. banned its use in 1971. Romberger's father, stationed with the Air Force in Vietnam in 1970 and '71, knew he was exposed but had no idea of the debilitating effects it would cause. After that exposure, Romberger says, it's likely nothing would have prevented his father from contracting the brain-wasting disease that killed him. But, he adds, his father could have been diagnosed years earlier, providing time to better plan his future and make his final years more comfortable. That's what Romberger wants to accomplish for others. \\"I'm hoping this ride raises the national awareness, becomes the squeaky wheel to get things rolling for these guys,\\" he says. \\"And I hope it becomes like an educational tool that says, 'Hey, there is help out there, there are people who care.'\\" ___ On the web: https://expeditionorange.org/ ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Expedition Orange is a 3,000-mile, coast-to-coast horseback ride aiming to raise awareness for Vietnam War veterans suffering from exposure to the toxic chemical Agent Orange.

If oh Jagged Edge Jagged Edge was a suspenseful one or uh Fatal Attraction, can we conclude that \\"Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction explored similar themes of betrayal and revenge.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction explored similar themes of betrayal and revenge, even though both films approached these themes from different angles and employed distinct storytelling techniques. A comparative analysis of both movies reveals the common ground they share while highlighting their unique features. Jagged Edge, directed by Richard Marquand and released in 1985, is an American courtroom thriller and suspenseful whodunit. It follows the story of a wealthy San Francisco heiress, Paige Forrester, who is brutally murdered, and her husband, accused of the crime, turning to a talented female attorney to prove his innocence. The film delves into themes of betrayal by presenting the protagonist's close relationship with her defense attorney and the possibility that he may be exploiting their bond for his hidden motives. The mounting suspense of whether the husband is indeed guilty or innocent is a central component of the story. The theme of revenge surfaces as the husband's motivations are scrutinized: Was this murder an act of retaliation, or is the husband being framed? Furthermore, the defense attorney's personal life is not exempt from these themes. She has her own rocky relationship, and a history of being betrayed by a previous client. This personal struggle makes her skeptical of the husband, despite her fierce determination to defend him in court. Fatal Attraction, directed by Adrian Lyne and released in 1987, is a psychological thriller about a married New York attorney named Dan Gallagher, who has a brief affair with a book editor, Alex Forrest. He attempts to break things off with Alex, but she becomes obsessed with him and starts stalking him and his family. This film presents betrayal in the context of adultery committed by the protagonist, Dan, and his decision to turn away from his affair. As a result, Alex feels intensely betrayed, sparking a series of violent outbursts and psychological manipulation in her quest to exact revenge on Dan and his family. Dan must now navigate the increasingly dangerous situations set up by Alex and protect his loved ones from harm. Comparing the two films, it's evident that betrayal is a significant theme in both Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction. Jagged Edge examines betrayal within the confines of a legal arena, showcasing moral dilemmas, trust issues, and the often-guarded relationships between an attorney and their client. On the other hand, Fatal Attraction delves into the dangers of infidelity and its potentially disastrous consequences, revealing the dark side of passion and the lengths that some individuals will go to vindicate their perceived betrayal. Additionally, the theme of revenge is pivotal to both stories. In Jagged Edge, revenge plays a role as a motive for murder or as a means to frame an innocent person. Fatal Attraction, on the contrary, revolves around revenge as a destructive force, demonstrating how an individual scorned can unleash havoc on the life of the one who betrayed them. In conclusion, though Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction approach the themes of betrayal and revenge in different ways, they do indeed explore these themes throughout their respective narratives. The two films portray the dire consequences of misplaced trust and emotional vulnerability, as well as the risks of being involved with manipulative and vengeful individuals."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: There is a zoo named Zhongshan in our city.

Poffo was born in Columbus, Ohio, the elder son of Judy and Angelo Poffo. His father was Italian American and his mother was Jewish; Poffo was raised Roman Catholic. Angelo was a well-known wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, who was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! for his ability to do sit-ups for hours on end. In June 1985, Savage signed with Vince McMahon. Billed as \\"the top free agent in pro wrestling\\", Savage's first appearances on Tuesday Night Titans featured several established managers (including Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, and \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie) offering their services to Savage. He eventually declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth as his new manager. His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone who even looked at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, 1985, participating in a 16-man tournament. He defeated Ivan Putski, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, and the Dynamite Kid before losing by a countout in the finals to Junkyard Dog. In late 1985, Savage started a feud with then Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana over that title. Santana beat him on October 19, 1985 at San Juan, Puerto Rico. The November 2, 1985 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, he unsuccessfully challenged Santana for the title (Savage won the match by countout, but not the title because the title did not change hands by countout). In a rematch on the February 24, 1986 (taped February 8) episode of Prime Time Wrestling, he won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship at the Boston Garden by using an illegal steel object stashed in his tights to knock out Santana. Early in his WWF career, Savage also won three countout victories (the first at the Spectrum in Philadelphia and the other two at Madison Square Garden) over his future tag team partner WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan (although the belt did not change hands due to the countout) as well as engaging in feuds with Bruno Sammartino and George \\"The Animal\\" Steele. During this time, Savage also formed a tag-team with semi-retired wrestler come color commentator Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, who would remain a vocal supporter of Savage until Ventura left the WWF in mid-1990, except during Savage's period as a face. Savage's feud with Steele began on the January 4, 1986 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, when Steele developed a crush on Miss Elizabeth. At WrestleMania 2, Savage defeated Steele in a match to retain his Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. He resumed his feud with Steele in early 1987, culminating in two Intercontinental Heavyweight title matches, both won by Savage. Savage wrestled Ricky Steamboat at WrestleMania III in the Pontiac Silverdome. After 19 two-counts, Steamboat pinned Savage (with help from George Steele, who pushed Savage from the top rope seconds before he was pinned) to end his near 14-month reign as Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. The match was extremely choreographed, as opposed to the \\"on the fly\\" nature of most wrestling matches at the time. Savage was a stickler for detail, and he and Steamboat laid out and rehearsed every spot in the match prior to WrestleMania, at his home in Florida. The match was named 1987's Match of the Year by both Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer. Steamboat and Savage were seen cheering with and hugging other wrestlers after the match.

On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it.

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

The hospital and Jahi's family reached a deal in court today in which Jahi's mom, Nailah Winkfield, will assume responsibility for the girl at the moment of transfer, reports the Oakland Tribune. Much remains in flux, though. It's not clear when Jahi will be moved, or where she will be taken. Also confusing: The judge refused to order the hospital to insert breathing and feeding tubes, or allow an outside doctor to do so, which had been described as necessary before any such transfer. The deal allows Jahi to be moved while on a ventilator, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"Right now, arrangements are being made, and what we needed to know was that when all the balls were in line, that we could move quickly,\\" said the family attorney. \\"So this is a victory in terms of getting us one step closer.\\" The hospital reiterated in court that it considers Jahi to be deceased. \\"It's horrible that this child has died,\\" said the hospital's attorney, who choked up while addressing the media. \\"It's also horrible that it's so difficult for her family to accept that death, and I wish and I constantly think that, wouldn't it be great if they could come to terms with this terrible tragic event and I wouldn't have to stand in front of you time after time.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"In an ongoing legal saga surrounding the status of a young girl declared brain-dead by Children's Hospital Oakland, Jahi McMath's mother, Nailah Winkfield, secured the right to move her daughter to another facility. This landmark decision came more than three weeks after the hospital announced Jahi's brain-death. The Oakland Tribune reported that the agreement reached in court positions Winkfield as primarily responsible for Jahi immediately upon transfer. Despite this significant development, several aspects of the situation remain uncertain, including the specific time and destination of Jahi's transfer. The court denied the family's request to command the hospital to install breathing and feeding tubes, which were formerly deemed obligatory for any relocation. Similarly, the judge rejected the suggestion to allow an external physician to execute this task. In lieu of these measures, the agreement enables Jahi's transfer while she remains on a ventilator, an arrangement that the San Francisco Chronicle documented. The family's representation stated that they are currently arranging the logistics of the move. \\"Right now, arrangements are being made, and what we needed to know was that when all the balls were in line, that we could move quickly,\\" the family attorney emphasized, celebrating this development as a symbol of progress. \\"So this is a victory in terms of getting us one step closer.\\" In court, the Oakland hospital reiterated its stance, affirming that it considers Jahi to have passed away. The attorney defending the hospital emotionally conveyed their perspective to the press, lamenting both Jahi's death and the family's struggle to accept it. \\"It's horrible that this child has died,\\" the attorney said, struggling to maintain composure. \\"It's also horrible that it's so difficult for her family to accept that death, and I wish and I constantly think that, wouldn't it be great if they could come to terms with this terrible tragic event and I wouldn't have to stand in front of you time after time.\\" The resolution of these matters contributes to an unfolding narrative that tests the boundaries of medical ethics, parental rights, and personal beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After yesterday’s story about Joe’s stripped VW, many wondered if Volkswagen was going to actually pay for the dismantled (but still running!) husk of a car, or if the company would just turn him away. Advertisement Advertisement It turns out, the answer is “neither,” as Joe just told me over the phone that a mere hour before his appointment at the VW dealership, a representative for the company— who most likely saw yesterday’s story on Jalopnik—called and told him his buyback appointment had been postponed. (We have reached out to Volkswagen directly about this matter and will update if we hear anything.) Joe says the rep told him that the reason for the delay is that VW believes stripping the car “wasn’t in the spirit of the buyback.” But as for the actual letter of the buyback, as Joe points out, the FTC Consent Order specifies only that to be eligible cars have to be “operable,” a term the document defines clearly as “can be driven under its own 2.0- liter TDI engine power.” Sponsored Joe says his car drives just fine. Photo: Joe Mayer Joe says the VW rep—whom he believes was heavily coached on what to tell him—did not give a time frame for his new appointment, but simply emailed him an attorney’s number to whom he should direct questions. He thinks the automaker is “just trying to bide some time,” and he expects them to get back to him once they have spoken with their lawyers, a move he fears is meant to find some way or another to get out of having to pay him. Joe remains firm that stripping the car wasn’t a breach of the terms in the class action suit, saying he plans to get his own legal advice in the coming days. As for when or if VW will schedule Joe’s new buyback appointment, we’ll just have to wait and see. For his part, Joe said he followed the claims process to the tee, uploading all of his documents as soon as the claims portal went online in an effort to be first on the buyback list. Advertisement The car enthusiast and Jalopnik reader fears that Volkswagen might drag this out, like it has with so many other upset VW owners. “I’ve waited long enough already,” he told me tonight. Update: Here’s the statement Volkswagen sent us, which doesn’t seem to directly address whether car-stripping is within the letter of the buyout terms or not: Advertisement Volkswagen’s priority is to make the 2.0L TDI settlement process as seamless and convenient as possible for our affected customers and we are working hard to ensure that this is the case. The program is governed by specific eligibility guidelines and other conditions which were agreed by all the parties and approved by the Court. Subject to regulatory approval of modifications that will allow vehicles to meet agreed emissions standards, the settlement allows Volkswagen to modify some of the vehicles we buy back so they can be returned to commerce rather than scrapped. The great majority of Volkswagen owners take very good care of their vehicles and are returning them for buyback intact. We’ll update as we hear more. ||||| Joe Mayer, a Cincinnati car salesman, says he’s turning in his 2010 Volkswagen Golf TDI as part of VW’s court-ordered buyback, but not before stripping the car down to the bone, removing the doors, seats, hood, bumpers, hatch and a big portion of the interior. Just look at this naked carcass he’s selling back to VW! We’ve heard about some VW diesel owners removing fascias and little interior pieces before turning in their vehicles for VW’s buyback, but Mayer is—and these are his own words—“[taking] the whole partout thing a bit to the extreme.” I called him up to see how serious he really is about trying to turn this stripped-down hatch in to the dealership, and he told me this isn’t a joke, and that he’s read the court documents and knows that the settlement terms only specify that the car has to be “operable,” i.e. that it can be driven under its own power. Advertisement Mayer bought his little diesel manual hatchback in the fall of 2015, just a few weeks before Volkswagen’s diesel scandal made headlines in September. In fact, he says he hadn’t even plated the car by the time the scandal broke, so when the time came to go to the DMV, he chose the “DSLGATE” license plate you see above. After the settlement terms came out, and Mayer read that the condition of the car doesn’t affect the payout, he decided to remove a bunch of parts from his Golf, figuring “Why not make a bit of extra money?” So he drove to a buddy’s house this past Sunday, drank some beer, ate some pizza, and ripped a bunch of parts off his Golf without a care in the world if something broke. Advertisement Mayer went all out stripping this thing, saying “Anything that could come off pretty much came off,” except for the dashboard, because that would be a pain in the butt, and the rearview mirror, because he still has to drive the thing, and nobody’s going to buy a used rearview mirror. Advertisement He said it was a “surprising amount of fun” removing airbags, doors, fenders, the engine cover, the shifter cover, bumpers, a bumper support, the radio, seats, interior trim pieces (he even removed the bezels for the AC vents!), the center console, the hatch, and a bunch more. He says he’ll “also be replacing the driver’s seat with a milk crate,” and that the headlights and taillights are “hanging on by one or two bolts,” as he plans to drive within a block of the dealership, quickly take off the lights, and putt his little hatchback skeleton into the service center. Advertisement I asked him if he was concerned about VW not taking the car, and he told me he talked with three VW settlement representatives over the phone, asking them if removing the doors, hatch, hood, seats and interior bits would affect the buyback amount, and they told him something to the effect of “I’m not telling you you’re allowed to, but the only thing required is that its drivable and operable.” Many people will think of Mayer’s actions as a bit petty, while others will think it’s fine, since Volkswagen may be recycling these cars anyway, and since VW was the one who betrayed its customers. Advertisement I’m not sure what to think; on one hand, I can imagine how fun it would be to strip a car without a care in the world, but on the other hand, if VW does find a fix for these cars, and wants to sell them, stripping cars could hurt the company and, more importantly, send a car into a junkyard unnecessarily—a car that has the potential to look really good: Mayer, a self-proclaimed car-lover and Jalopnik reader, says he hopes to buy a manual Toyota FJ Cruiser after turning in his Golf tomorrow. That is, if the dealership accepts it. We’ll find out soon enough.

Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \\"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The predecessor to vinyl in the record industry was shellac."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 2-1 Lions returned home in Week 4 to face the 3-0 Chicago Bears. Robbie Gould started the scoring for the Bears with a 34-yard field goal, but field goals of 23 and 31 yards by David Akers put the Lions up 6-3. Early in the second quarter, Matt Fort&#233; exploded for a 53-yard touchdown run to put Chicago back up, 10-6. The lead was narrowed to 10-9 when Akers connected on a 41-yard field goal. The Lions then reeled off three straight touchdowns in the span of three and a half minutes. Set up by a 57-yard punt return from Micheal Spurlock, Matthew Stafford scored first when he recovered his own fumble in the end zone following a 1-yard quarterback sneak. On Chicago's next possession, Jay Cutler's second interception of the day was returned by Glover Quin 42 yards, to the Bears 2. One play later, Stafford hit Calvin Johnson in the corner of the end zone for a 2-yard TD. On the Lions next possession, Reggie Bush scored on a 37-yard TD run, hurdling Bears safety Major Wright on his way to the end zone. Robbie Gould closed the half with a 28-yard field goal that made the score 30-13. Gould would connect again on a 25-yarder in the third quarter to get the Bears within two touchdowns. On Chicago's next possession, Ndamukong Suh forced a Jay Cutler fumble, then Nick Fairley scooped up the ball and took it the remaining 4 yards for the score to give Detroit a 37-16 lead. David Akers extended it to 40-16 on a 43-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. The Bears attempted a furious rally in the final minutes. Cutler hit Alshon Jeffery on a 14-yard TD pass with four minutes left, then connected with Jeffery again for a 2-point conversion to make the score 40-24. On a potential clock-killing drive, Lions running back Joique Bell lost a fumble, and the Bears took advantage with another Cutler TD pass - this one going 10 yards to Earl Bennett. After another successful 2-point conversion, Chicago was within one score, 40-32. But Detroit's Kris Durham recovered the ensuing onside kick to preserve the victory. After throwing just one interception in eight previous games against the Lions, Jay Cutler threw three picks in this game, two of them being grabbed by Lions safety Louis Delmas. Reggie Bush rushed 18 times for 139 yards, and had another 34 yards on four receptions.

Article: If you have a chance to go to Taiwan, there's one place you should not miss-- the Taipei Palace Museum. The museum has around 650,000 pieces of ancient Chinese treasures. These treasures were originally in the Palace Museum in Beijing. But how did they get to Taiwan? In 1931, the Japanese invaded the northeast part of China. To protect the national treasures from the Japanese, the government of the Republic of China decided to move some important pieces to Nanjing. However, they did not stay long in Nanjing. In 1949, the people's Liberation Army won in the Liberation War. The Guomindang government went from Nanjing to Taiwan. Along with them they took the art pieces. The Taipei Palace Museum was set up in 1965 to hold the national treasures. Taiwan people are very proud of the Taipei Palace Museum. Some of the collections are world famous. One of the most visited art pieces in the museum is the \\"Jade Cabbage\\". It is made from a single piece of jade . If you take a close look, you can see two grasshoppers on the leaves, a large one and a small one, which were the symbol of many children in a family. If you are interested in the treasures, you could take a look at a TV programme called Taipei Palace Museum. It gives a picture of the treasures of the Taipei Palace Museum.

Are the following two questions the same? Is there any difference between non-binary and ternary compounds? What is the difference between binary and ternary compounds?","completion":"The two questions are not the same, but they are related as they deal with the classification of chemical compounds based on the number of constituent elements. Let me explain the differences by addressing each question and providing some context regarding the types of compounds. 1. Is there any difference between non-binary and ternary compounds? To answer this question, we first need to define both non-binary and ternary compounds and determine if they are comparable categories. Non-binary compounds refer to chemical compounds that do not consist of only two elements. In other words, non-binary describes any compound that is not binary, including ternary, quaternary, and higher-order compounds. Non-binary compounds can be divided into: - Ternary compounds: consisting of three elements. - Quaternary compounds: consisting of four elements. - Quinary compounds: consisting of five elements. - Senary compounds: consisting of six elements. - And so on... Ternary compounds, as the name suggests, are a specific type of non-binary compound that consists of three constituent elements. The category of non-binary compounds encompasses ternary compounds and all other higher-order compounds. Therefore, the difference between non-binary and ternary compounds is in their scope and inclusiveness. Non-binary compounds is a broader category encompassing all compounds with more than two elements, whereas ternary compounds specifically describe compounds with three elements. 2. What is the difference between binary and ternary compounds? Binary and ternary compounds are distinct categories of chemical compounds based on the number of constituent elements. The key differences between binary and ternary compounds are: - Binary compounds consist of exactly two different elements. Examples of binary compounds include water (H2O, consisting of hydrogen and oxygen), sodium chloride (NaCl, consisting of sodium and chlorine), and carbon dioxide (CO2, consisting of carbon and oxygen). - Ternary compounds, on the other hand, consist of three different elements. Examples of ternary compounds include sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, consisting of sodium, carbon, and oxygen), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, consisting of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, consisting of calcium, oxygen, and hydrogen). In summary, the two questions are related but not the same. The first question addresses the differences between the broader category of non-binary compounds and the specific category of ternary compounds. The second question focuses on the differences between binary and ternary compounds, which are two distinct categories within the overall classification of chemical compounds based on the number of constituent elements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Background: Richard Charles \\"Dick\\" Lewontin (born March 29, 1929) is an American evolutionary biologist, mathematician, geneticist, and social commentator. A leader in developing the mathematical basis of population genetics and evolutionary theory, he pioneered the application of techniques from molecular biology, such as gel electrophoresis, to questions of genetic variation and evolution. In a pair of seminal 1966 papers co-authored with J.L. Hubby in the journal Genetics, Lewontin helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. In 1979 he and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the term \\"spandrel\\" into evolutionary theory. Context: Along with others, such as Gould, Lewontin has been a persistent critic of some themes in neo-Darwinism. Specifically, he has criticised proponents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology such as Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins, who attempt to explain animal behaviour and social structures in terms of evolutionary advantage or strategy. He and others criticize this approach when applied to humans, as he sees it as genetic determinism. In his writing, Lewontin suggests a more nuanced view of evolution is needed, which requires a more careful understanding of the context of the whole organism as well as the environment. Such concerns about what he views as the oversimplification of genetics has led Lewontin to be a frequent participant in debates, and an active life as a public intellectual. He has lectured widely to promote his views on evolutionary biology and science. In books such as Not in Our Genes (co-authored with Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin) and numerous articles, Lewontin has questioned much of the claimed heritability of human behavioral traits, such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests. Some academics have criticized him for rejecting sociobiology for non-scientific reasons. Edward Wilson (1995) suggested that Lewontin's political beliefs affected his scientific view. Robert Trivers described Lewontin as \\"...a man with great talents who often wasted them on foolishness, on preening and showing off, on shallow political thinking and on useless philosophical rumination while limiting his genetic work by assumptions congenial to his politics.\\" Lewontin has at times identified himself as Marxist, and admitted that his ideological views have affected his scientific work (Levins and Lewontin 1985). Others such as Kitcher (1985) have countered that Lewontin's criticisms of sociobiology are genuine scientific concerns about the discipline. He wrote that attacking Lewontin's motives amounts to an ad hominem argument. Question: Who has he worked with in the past? Answer:","completion":"Richard Lewontin has worked with several notable scientists and researchers in the past. Some of these collaborators include: 1. J.L. Hubby: Lewontin co-authored a pair of seminal 1966 papers with Hubby in the journal Genetics, which helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. 2. Stephen Jay Gould: In 1979, Lewontin and Gould introduced the term \\"spandrel\\" into evolutionary theory. 3. Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin: Lewontin co-authored the book \\"Not in Our Genes\\" with Rose and Kamin, which questioned the heritability of human behavioral traits such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests. 4. Richard Levins: Lewontin has collaborated with Levins, and they both admitted the influence of their Marxist ideologies on their scientific work in a 1985 publication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is similar to some other Western countries such as Britain and the USA, where bread and potatoes are commonly consumed as main sources of carbohydrates and daily sustenance.

Alan Victor White (born 26 May 1972 in Lewisham, South London) is an English rock drummer, best known as being the drummer of the English rock band Oasis from 1995 to 2004. Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed from the band. In early 2004, White surprisingly left Oasis during the early recording sessions for the band's sixth album. According to Oasis' spokesperson, there were some new tracks and demos with White's performances, which were made at the end of 2003 and early 2004 as the very first demos for their upcoming album, before his departure. In an interview, Noel Gallagher alluded to White's personal problems: \\"He's a ******* great guy, and he's one of the best drummers I've ever met in my life, but his personal life is ******* chaos. In the end he ****** ***, and we haven't seen him since.\\" In an interview on Radio 1 with Chris Moyles (15 August 2008), Noel Gallagher stated that White was \\"kicked out\\" of the band. There is also evidence to suggest that White was upset that his drums were going down so low in the mix on top of the prevalence of drum loops (\\"Go Let It Out\\", \\"Gas Panic!\\", \\"The Hindu Times\\", \\"Better Man\\", \\"Force of Nature\\"). On one Q&A with Freddie Gee, he had said: \\"Well, I don't like that my drums get turned down with each successive mix we do of an album, but one mustn't grumble in this band.\\" White was replaced with Zak Starkey, The Who drummer and the son of The Beatles' Ringo Starr. Ringo particularly was cited as one of White's biggest drumming influences. Due to his departure, the band scrapped the first midway sessions and later suffered some prolonged and difficult recording for Don't Believe the Truth (2005).","completion":"This text is about Alan Victor White, an English rock drummer.

A massive increase in antibiotic prescriptions is being fuelled by out-of-hours GPs – with potentially fatal consequences, experts claim. The number handed out by doctors covering nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010. Health experts say locums filling these shifts – as well as dentists and walk-in centres – do not know patients and are more inclined to hand out antibiotics as a quick fix. Number of antibiotics prescribed by doctors on nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010. Overall, the number of antibiotics prescribed by GPs, hospitals, dentists and out of hours clinics has risen by 6 per cent in four years. This is despite repeated attempts by the NHS to bring the figure down over fears that over-prescribing is creating strains of drug-resistant bacteria, making many illnesses effectively untreatable – including potentially deadly ones. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has warned that the threat is 'as big as terrorism' and could lead to minor scratches becoming fatal. It has been caused by over-prescribing antibiotics – meant for bacterial illnesses, even for coughs and colds, which are caused by viruses and are unaffected by the drugs. Scientists have warned that E. coli, a frequent cause of infection, is becoming resistant to antibiotics. Bacteria have gradually become more resistant and a growing number cannot be eradicated by common treatments. In the first study of its kind, Public Health England looked at prescriptions for antibiotics in hospitals, GP surgeries, out-of-hours clinics and dentists. Since 2010, the numbers have risen by 6 per cent, from 25.9 doses per day for every 1,000 people to 27.4 doses. This is 28 per cent higher than the European average of 21.3 doses per 1,000 people. Previously, GPs have been blamed for handing out drugs too freely under pressure from demanding patients who expect to be given some sort of medication. But this report shows the number given by family doctors fell last year by 3.5 per cent to 21.5 doses per day. Those from out-of-hours doctors, walk-in centres and dentists has risen by 32 per cent since 2010. Dr Susan Hopkins, the epidemiologist behind the report, said: 'GPs know patients and they're able to give a back-up prescription so they don't immediately go and fill it – they only take it if they get worse over the next few days. 'It's a really good measure of reducing prescribing. Urgent-care centres don't know that patient.' Her study is the first to look at the issue across the NHS. It also found that the number of prescriptions handed out in hospitals had increased by 12 per cent. Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: 'Anti-microbial resistance is one of the biggest threats to health security facing the world today.'

Article: You do not need every word to understand the meaning of what you read. In fact, too much emphasis on separate words both slows your speed and reduces your comprehension. First, any habit which slows down your silent reading to the speed at which you speak or read aloud, is inefficient. If you point to each word as you read, or move your head, or form the words with your lips, you read poorly. Less obvious habits also hold back reading efficiency . One is \\"saying\\" each word silently by moving your tongue or throat; another is \\"hearing\\" each word as you read. These are habits which should have been outgrown long ago. The beginning reader is learning how letters can make words, how written words are pronounced, and how sentences are put together. Your reading purpose is quite different, which is to understand meaning. It has been supposed that up to 75% of the words in English sentences are not really necessary for expressing the meaning. The secret of silent reading is to find out those key words and phrases which carry the thought, and to pay less attention to words which exist only for grammatical completeness. An efficient reader can grasp the meaning from a page at least twice as fast as he can read the page aloud. He takes in a whole phrase or thought unit at a time. If he \\"says\\" or \\"hears\\" words to himself, they are selected ones, said for emphasis.

His father remembered \\"writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want.\\" Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden. On 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the BBC's John Peel show (\\"Cello Song\\", \\"Three Hours\\", \\"River Man\\", \\"Time of No Reply\\" and an early version of \\"Bryter Layter\\"), three of which were broadcast on the following night.

It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig! The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically. Question: \\"Jaume was defeated by whom and died in what year?\\" Response: \\"Family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for AragÃ³n.

Most digital metronomes will use BPM or beats per minute as a way to measure the speed of the piece. Some mobile metronomes available for phones will even allow you to tap the beat on your screen to get the corresponding tempo. On most quartz metronomes, the BPM is listed around the edge of the dial. Within the BPM selections, there are corresponding Italian words that are traditionally used to describe tempo, such as Allegro and Presto. On wind-up models, you simply slide the weight up the metal bar to the desired tempo or the marking indicated on the music to be rehearsed. Many digital metronomes will allow you to set the time signature, but most wind-up metronomes do not. Time signatures consist of 2 numbers written how you would write a mathematical fraction. The top number indicates the number of beats in a measure. The bottom number indicates the value of the beat. For example, a piece in 4/4 time would have 4 quarter notes in a measure, while a piece in 2/4 time would have 2 quarter notes in a measure. Some pieces of music may have several time signatures. To practice them with a metronome you will have to take it in parts and reset the metronome to match the changing time signatures. Setting the volume for the metronome is especially important for any digital devices. You want to find a volume that won't be drowned out by the music but isn't overwhelming either. Many swinging or wind-up metronomes will not have a volume control, but musicians can follow the swinging of the metronome to keep accurate time even if they are unable to hear the metronome over the music. Some electronic metronomes will also have an LED light that goes on and off in time with the beat.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. How long did the author spend in Puerto Rico?

Make this proper case","completion":"Sure, I can change this sentence to its proper case. Here is the process step-by-step: 1. \\"3:12\\": This seems to be a verse number. In standard English, verse numbers are often written exactly the same way, so I'll leave it as it is. 2. \\"unlike cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother.\\": This is the first sentence and should begin with a capital letter to be grammatically correct. Additionally, the name of the person, \\"cain\\", should also be capitalized. So, it becomes \\"Unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother.\\" 3. \\"why did he kill him?\\": This is a question, so it should start with a capital letter. It becomes \\"Why did he kill him?\\" 4. \\"because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.\\" : This sentence starts with \\"because\\", yet it can stand on its own as a complete sentence. So, it should start with a capital letter. The use of the word \\"righteous\\" as an adjective also fits here to complete the meaning.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"During the third quarter, there had been essentially no growth in investment expenditures. However, the situation changed drastically as the growth rate of this component jumped to an impressive 19 percent. This surprising shift can be attributed to several factors that contributed to the surge in investment expenditures. A detailed analysis can help explain the reasons for this sudden growth and its implications for the economy as a whole. 1. Economic Recovery: One possible reason for the jump in investment expenditures could be a general improvement in the economic conditions. As the economic outlook brightens and confidence rises, businesses may see this as an opportune time to invest in new projects and expand their operations. This rise in investment expenditures may indicate an economy on the path to recovery. 2. Government Policies: Pro-investment government policies or initiatives could have also played a role in boosting investment expenditures. For example, if the government introduces tax incentives or guarantees loans for businesses, it's more likely that they'll invest in potential growth opportunities. Reduced regulations and bureaucratic barriers can also make the investment process more attractive and accessible to businesses. 3. Low-Interest Rates: If interest rates are low, businesses are more likely to borrow funds for new investments. Low borrowing costs can increase the likelihood of investments with potentially higher returns. As borrowing becomes more affordable, companies are encouraged to invest in capital formation and business expansion. 4. Technological Advancements: Rapid advancements in technology can also drive investment growth. Companies may see the value in investing in research and development, infrastructure, and technology adoption to stay competitive and agile in the market. As businesses invest in new technological capabilities, growth in investment expenditures can surge. 5. Market Demand: Increased market demand may have prompted businesses to expand their capacities and production capabilities. If consumer and business demand increases, companies are more likely to invest in new projects and expansions to meet these needs and capitalize on the opportunities. 6. Global Market Conditions: The global economic landscape can also impact investment expenditures. If international market conditions are favorable and prospects for exports are positive, businesses may elect to invest in expanding their reach and presence in foreign markets. 7. Previous Underinvestment: It is also worth considering that the sudden growth in investment expenditures could be a result of previous underinvestment. A period of economic uncertainty or recession may have caused businesses to delay or reduce their investments. As conditions improve, businesses may be playing catch-up by making long-overdue investments to improve their positions and capitalize on new opportunities. In conclusion, the 19 percent growth in investment expenditures after a period of no growth can be attributed to a variety of factors, including an improving economy, government policies, low-interest rates, technological advancements, increased market demand, favorable global market conditions, and a possible reaction to previous underinvestment. Understanding these factors can help forecast future growth rates, recognize potential risks, and inform policy decisions to support a healthy and thriving economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answer to these two questions is not the same because they address different aspects of a Taurus individual's relationships and personality traits existing within them. Let's address each question separately to provide a thorough understanding of the topics. Question 1: What are the signs that a Taurus man really likes you? Taurus men are known for their loyal, stable, and determined nature. They are sensual, reliable, and devoted, making them excellent partners once they have established trust and genuine feelings for someone. Here are some signs that a Taurus man really likes you: 1. Consistency and reliability: If a Taurus man is frequently in touch with you, consistently making plans, and maintaining contact, it is an indicator of his genuine interest. 2. Takes time to get to know you: A Taurus man will invest time in getting to know you deeply - understanding your preferences, hobbies, and your emotional world. 3. Reveals his vulnerable side: Taurus men are known for their strength and reserve. If a Taurus man starts to open up and share his feelings, emotions, or insecurities, it's a sign he really likes you and trusts you. 4. Protectiveness and possessiveness: A Taurus man in love can become protective of the person he cares about, sometimes taking it a bit too far and becoming possessive. If he is concerned for your well-being and displays a protective nature, he is likely quite interested in you. 5. Generosity: A Taurus man in love will be very generous, both emotionally and materially. He will shower you with thoughtful gifts and give you his undivided attention. 6. Physical affection: Taurus men are known for their sensuality and appreciation of physical touch. If a Taurus man becomes more physically affectionate and seeks opportunities to touch or hug you, it can be a strong signal that he is attracted to you. 7. Includes you in his future plans: When a Taurus man includes you in his long-term goals and future plans, it indicates that he is serious about the relationship. Question 2: I'm a Taurus, but why do I feel like an Aries? Astrology depends on various factors, and your sun sign - the zodiac sign you know based on your birth date - is just one aspect of your astrological chart. There are several reasons why you might feel more like an Aries rather than a Taurus. Some considerations include: 1. Your Ascendant or Rising sign: Your Rising sign is the sign on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth. It impacts your appearance, outward personality, and how others perceive you. If your Rising sign is Aries, it can be a significant reason why you relate more to Aries traits than Taurus traits. 2. Moon sign: Your Moon sign represents your emotional nature and inner world. If your Moon sign is in Aries, you may find yourself connecting more to Aries' characteristics. 3. Close proximity of the Sun sign: If you were born on the cusp, close to the dates when the Sun moves from Aries to Taurus (around April 19-20), you may possess traits from both signs, and that could be why you feel a connection to Aries characteristics. 4. Dominant planets and aspects: Various astrological aspects, such as the placement of planets and their influences in your birth chart, can alter how your sun sign manifests in your life. 5. Personal experiences and environmental factors: Astrology alone does not determine one's personality traits. Your upbringing, experiences, and environment also play a significant role in shaping your characteristics and preferences. To understand your astrological profile more accurately, consult an astrologer who can analyze your birth chart or perform an in-depth study of your unique astrological chart. This comprehensive understanding will provide insights into your sun, moon, and rising signs, as well as other critical factors influencing your identity beyond your Taurus sun sign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Throughout mid-2000, after aligning himself with Edge & Christian, \\"Team ECK\\" (Edge, Christian, and Kurt) feuded with Too Cool and Rikishi, with Angle defeating Rikishi in the finals of the King of the Ring tournament. He went on to feud with Triple H after a love triangle between them and Triple H's wife, Stephanie McMahon, developed. As a change to the intended storyline of Stephanie turning on her husband and going with Angle, he lost to Triple H at Unforgiven. Before the match started, however, he bumped into a returning Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was looking for the perpetrator who ran him over at the previous year's Survivor Series. Angle offered him his friendship and one of his gold medals, but Austin was not pleased by telling him that he would keep it in a nice safe place, to which Austin referred to \\"right up his ass\\" before attacking Angle and throwing his medal to the floor. Following his feud with Triple H, Angle received another push and began pursuing the WWF Championship, defeating The Rock at No Mercy, after botched interference on The Rock's behalf from Rikishi. With his victory over The Rock, Angle became the first wrestler to have won both an Olympic Gold medal and the world championship. Angle retained the WWF Championship for the rest of the year in matches with The Undertaker at Survivor Series and in a six-man Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon.

Angle then feuded with Chris Benoit whom he defeated at WrestleMania X-Seven, but lost to him at Backlash in an Ultimate Submission match; Benoit defeated Angle four falls to three in sudden-death overtime. Continuing the feud, Angle again defeated Benoit in a two out of three falls match at Judgment Day. Benoit pinned Angle after an Angle Slam in a \\"Pinfalls Only\\" fall, and then Angle made Benoit submit with the ankle lock in the \\"Submissions Only\\" fall. Angle won the third fall, a ladder match, with the help of Edge and Christian.

He kept the title for a while, but then lost it to The Rock again. After that, Angle had more matches with a wrestler named Chris Benoit, and they took turns winning and losing against each other. In the end, Angle won a special ladder match with the help of his friends Edge and Christian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Permiteţi-mi să subliniez că multimarca există - şi va continua să existe - acolo unde realitatea pieţei o solicită. Translate to English English:","completion":"Allow me to emphasize that multi-branding exists - and will continue to exist - where the market reality demands it. In today's world, multi-brand strategy plays a vital role in businesses to sustain and grow their market presence. This approach is adopted by companies to target a diverse range of customer segments, meet their varying needs, and ultimately, provide better value to the customers. There is no doubt that competition has become fierce and the global market is constantly evolving. To cater to these changes, multi-branding has become essential. It offers various advantages such as product diversification, increased market share, strong brand recognition, and greater opportunities for expansion. By offering a variety of brands, companies can appeal to a wider range of customers, each with their own unique preferences. For instance, while one person may prefer an affordable and simple product, another might opt for a more luxurious and feature-rich variant. Having multiple brands enables organizations to present options that cater to all types of consumers. Moreover, multi-branding can help in spreading the risks that might come with market fluctuations and unforeseen changes. The negative impact on one brand can be minimized if the company has other successful brands in its portfolio. This diversification can provide a safety net that ensures the brand's overall stability and growth. Increased market share is another key advantage of a multi-brand strategy. Having multiple brands gives companies the leverage to penetrate different market segments and expand their reach. Not only does this result in higher sales, it also makes it more difficult for competitors to gain a significant market share. In terms of brand recognition, multi-branding offers the opportunity to build a strong reputation across various customer segments. By catering to a wide range of preferences, companies create goodwill among their customer base and enhance the likelihood of customers forming a positive association with their brands. This can lead to long-lasting customer relationships that fuel business growth. Lastly, multi-branding offers opportunities for expansion, both nationally and internationally. Since this strategy allows companies to target multiple segments and markets, it provides a natural platform for venturing into new territories and conquering new customer bases. In conclusion, multi-branding is a valuable strategy that exists and will continue to play a significant role in the global market. As companies need to stay agile and innovative in meeting customer demands, embracing a multi-brand approach remains crucial for businesses to maximize their potential and ensure long-term success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Write a title: LONDON -- Eight men charged with conspiracy to murder in a trans-Atlantic terror plot made their first court appearance yesterday in a case that has added to the fierce debate over Britain's terrorism laws and heightened fears in the country's Islamic community of an anti-Muslim backlash.","completion":"Title: \\"Trans-Atlantic Terror Plot: The Court Case that Shaped the UK's War on Terror and the Impact on Its Islamic Community\\" The trial of the eight men accused of conspiracy to murder in a trans-Atlantic terror plot has been nothing short of a sensation in the United Kingdom and beyond. As one of the most significant terror cases to emerge since the infamous September 11 attacks, it has captivated the world's attention and brought a wave of unrest, apprehension, and civil liberty concerns in its wake. The court proceedings, which began with the highly publicized first court appearance of the suspects, have unleashed a torrent of debate on Britain's terrorism laws and have magnified anxieties within the nation's Islamic community of a potential anti-Muslim backlash. The case can be best understood in three distinctive, yet interconnected aspects: the legal battles that have taken place in the courts, the impact of the case on the UK's counter-terrorism laws, and the social consequences that have arisen across the British Muslim community. First and foremost, the legal battle between prosecutors and defense attorneys has been nothing short of dramatic. The case against the eight men has largely hinged on the unveiling of their alleged trans-Atlantic terror plot, which entailed plans to bomb several airplanes bound for the United States and Canada using liquid explosives concealed in carry-on luggage. It has been reported that thousands of lives could have been put at risk had the plan been successfully executed. As a result, defenders of the accused have fought vehemently to challenge the reliability of the evidence presented against their clients. The prosecution, on the other hand, has endeavored to prove the veracity of the claims and reiterate the severity of the charges. As the legal proceedings have played out in the public eye, so too has the heated debate around the UK's counter-terrorism laws that the trans-Atlantic terror plot has inflamed. Critics argue that existing legislation contains civil liberty violations and disproportionately targets Muslims, while proponents of tougher laws argue that they are indispensable for ensuring public safety. In the political arena, the case has led to calls for legislation that would allow the British government to hold terrorism suspects without charge for up to 90 days, a notion that has ignited concerns regarding human rights and further polarized the already-divided public opinion. Last but not least, the case has had major ramifications for the country's Islamic community. With reports of the suspects' connections to extremist Islamic factions and the highly-charged atmosphere surrounding the trial, fears of an anti-Muslim backlash in the UK have been intensified. The situation is reflective of a broader context, one in which international events such as the September 11 attacks and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East have incited skepticism and apprehension toward Muslims residing in Western nations. British Muslims have thus found themselves in a precarious situation, facing the prospect of heightened discrimination, suspicion, and potential alienation from broader society. In summary, the trans-Atlantic terror plot and the resulting court case involving the eight men charged with conspiracy to murder have overshadowed national conversations in the United Kingdom. It has brought forth crucial questions about the boundaries of counter-terrorism laws, the delicate balance of civil liberties, and the potentially detrimental effects on the nation's Islamic community. This complex and important case will remain a critical symbol of the fight against terrorism in the UK as it continues to reverberate through political, legal, and social spheres for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While a broad range of literature focuses on recovering a single image from a blurred image, in this work, we tackle a more challenging task i.e. video restoration from a blurred image. We formulate video restoration from a single blurred image as an inverse problem by setting clean image sequence and their respective motion as latent factors, and the blurred image as an observation. Our framework is based on an encoder-decoder structure with spatial transformer network modules to restore a video sequence and its underlying motion in an end-to-end manner. We design a loss function and regularizers with complementary properties to stabilize the training and analyze variant models of the proposed network. The effectiveness and transferability of our network are highlighted through a large set of experiments on two different types of datasets: camera rotation blurs generated from panorama scenes and dynamic motion blurs in high speed videos.

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom.

To make that very specific, if we agree with you, does that mean that we would, in principle, have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional? I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the term from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author plus 50 years. Now they're extending it life of the author plus 70. If the latter is unconstitutional on your theory, how could the former not be? And if the former is, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous. Hypothesis: The 1976 extension could be unconstitutional and off putting.","completion":"The hypothesis proposed from the given context, \\"The 1976 extension could be unconstitutional and off-putting,\\" certainly fits within the realms of the discussion. In fact, the insinuations in the text suggest that there could be potential constitutional issues with the 1976 extension. However, it is also important to dig deeper into the matter to fully understand the implications and grounds for such a hypothesis. The context raises a hypothetical concern in the way copyright laws were amended by the U.S. Congress over time, in particular, the specific changes made in 1976 and thereafter. The 1976 Copyright Act extended copyright duration from 28 years, which was renewable once, to the life of the author plus 50 years. The latter modification extended it further to the life of the author plus 70 years. The speaker questions if these repeated extensions, specifically the move from a term of 'life of the author' plus 50 years to 'life of the author' plus 70 years, could be deemed unconstitutional. The speaker also poses an implicit question: If the more recent change (adding an extra 20 years to the term) is judged to be unconstitutional, could the 1976 modification—which shifted from a set term of years to a term based on the author's life—also be considered unconstitutional? One must note that the speaker seems to take no affirmative stand about the unconstitutionality of either extension. Instead, they pose it as a query or hypothetical situation in an attempt to explore the implications if such unconstitutionality were declared. The speaker goes on to express concern about the 'chaos' that might ensue if the 1976 extension were declared unconstitutional. This is where the \\"off-putting\\" part of the hypothesis comes into play. The speaker seems to suggest that such a dramatic reversal could cause significant disruption and confusion. It's important to mention that the unconstitutionality of these extensions would likely be related to concerns around limiting free speech or curtailing the public domain, which are fundamental to the constitutional framework supporting intellectual freedom. So, to conclude, the extracted hypothesis is indeed plausible, considering that the speaker brings up the potential unconstitutionality of 1976 extension and alludes to the potentially off-putting fallout from such a judgment. Yet, it should also be noted that no firm conclusion or judgment is made in this context. The concerns are presented as hypothetical and speculative, highlighting a possible but not definite interpretation of the repeated extensions to copyright duration."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Everything's\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor abandoned his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations.

Write the answer: What make of car was founded in 1963 in a tractor factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, and is now a subsidiary of Volkswagen?","completion":"The make of car that was founded in 1963 in a tractor factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, and is now a subsidiary of Volkswagen is Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., commonly known as Lamborghini. Lamborghini was the brainchild of its founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini, who was an Italian industrialist with a passion for engineering and automobiles. Before venturing into the automotive industry, Ferruccio was successful in his tractor manufacturing business, Lamborghini Trattori. The legend goes that Ferruccio, an owner of high-end sports cars, including Ferraris, was not entirely satisfied with certain aspects of his vehicles. Motivated by the ambition to create a perfect grand tourer, he decided to establish his own car manufacturing company. The foundation of Lamborghini as a car manufacturer was laid in a tractor factory located in a small Northern Italian village, Sant'Agata Bolognese, in 1963. The brand's emblem, the Raging Bull, was inspired by Ferruccio's zodiac sign, Taurus (the bull), and his interest in the Spanish culture and tradition of bullfighting. The logo symbolizes power, strength, and resilience, all attributes that Lamborghini models exhibit. Lamborghini's very first production car, the 350GT, was launched in 1964. It was well-received and followed by iconic models like the Miura, Espada, Jarama, and Urraco. In 1974, they released the attention-grabbing Lamborghini Countach, which exemplified the brand's commitment to cutting-edge design and elite performance capabilities. Over the years, Lamborghini experienced numerous ups and downs in the business world. It went through bankruptcy, a series of ownership changes, and challenges stemming from the oil crisis in the 1970s. The ownership of the company changed hands several times between the Mimran brothers, Chrysler, and finally the Indonesian company Megatech. In 1998, the Volkswagen Group stepped in and acquired Lamborghini under their Audi brand. Being a subsidiary of Volkswagen, Lamborghini has witnessed significant growth, financial stability, and access to advanced engineering technology. Today, it has established itself as an elite and high-performance luxury sports car manufacturer, known for its avant-garde designs, precision engineering, and state-of-the-art technologies. Some of the most recent and celebrated models launched under Volkswagen's ownership include the Lamborghini Gallardo, Murciélago, Aventador, Huracán, and the Urus SUV. These automobiles showcase the brand's excellence in performance, distinctive design language, and engineering expertise, securing Lamborghini's position as a leader in the luxury sports car market. In conclusion, Lamborghini's journey from a tractor manufacturing unit in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, to becoming a prestigious subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group is a testament to the brand's persistence, dedication to quality, and love for automotive innovation. With a rich history and present-day success, Lamborghini remains a symbol of luxury, performance, and exclusivity in the automotive world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE DINNER AT BICKERSTAFF'S--HIFFERNAN AND HIS IMPECUNIOSITY--KENRICK'S EPIGRAM--JOHNSON'S CONSOLATION--GOLDSMITH'S TOILET--THE BLOOM-COLORED COAT--NEW ACQUAINTANCES--THE HORNECKS--A TOUCH OF POETRY AND PASSION--THE JESSAMY BRIDE In October Goldsmith returned to town and resumed his usual haunts. We hear of him at a dinner given by his countryman, Isaac Bickerstaff, author of Love in a Village, Lionel and Clarissa, and other successful dramatic pieces. The dinner was to be followed by the reading by Bickerstaff of a new play. Among the guests was one Paul Hiffernan, likewise an Irishman; somewhat idle and intemperate; who lived nobody knew how nor where, sponging wherever he had a chance, and often of course upon Goldsmith, who was ever the vagabond's friend, or rather victim. Hiffernan was something of a physician, and elevated the emptiness of his purse into the dignity of a disease, which he termed _impecuniosity_, and against which he claimed a right to call for relief from the healthier purses of his friends. He was a scribbler for the newspapers, and latterly a dramatic critic, which had probably gained him an invitation to the dinner and reading. The wine and wassail, however, befogged his senses. Scarce had the author got into the second act of his play, when Hiffernan began to nod, and at length snored outright. Bickerstaff was embarrassed, but continued to read in a more elevated tone. The louder he read, the louder Hiffernan snored; until the author came to a pause. \\"Never mind the brute, Bick, but go on,\\" cried Goldsmith. \\"He would have served Homer just so if he were here and reading his own works.\\" 1.

It tells the story of Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov, who one day wakes up to find that his nose has mysteriously gone missing, only to later encounter it living an independent life disguised as a high-ranking official. Step 2: Analyze main themes and symbols There are a few key themes and symbols in \\"The Nose\\" that can be related to cultural values. These include absurdity, social hierarchy and status, appearances, and bureaucracy. Step 3: Relate themes to Russian cultural values From the themes mentioned above, the cultural value that stands out in the story is the emphasis on social hierarchy and status within the Russian society of that time. Gogol satirizes the obsession with social standing by depicting how characters interact based on their ranks and positions in society. For example, Kovalyov feels humiliated and uncomfortable when he cannot present himself properly due to the absence of his nose. The nose itself adopts a high-ranking position as a state councilor, further highlighting the absurdity of social hierarchies and artificial importance placed on them. Step 4: Conclusion In conclusion, \\"The Nose\\" represents the value of social hierarchy and status in Russian culture during that period. Through the use of satire and absurdity, Gogol criticizes the arbitrariness of social standings and the superficial nature of interactions between individuals based solely on their positions within the hierarchy. This can be considered as a reflection of the societal values and attitudes in Russia at the time that Gogol was writing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is because understanding Alex's requirements helps Skylar create a customized and effective filing system. To proceed with this task, Skylar should consider the following steps: 1. Discuss with Alex: Begin by asking Alex about his experiences and struggles in organizing tax documents. Identify his priorities, preferences, and the scope of documents he deals with. 2. Research tax document categories: It's essential to have a basic understanding of the different types of tax documents, such as W-2s, 1099s, and receipts for deductions. This knowledge will help categorize and sort the documents in an organized manner. 3. Determine the organization method: Evaluate the use and frequency of accessing specific documents and decide on a suitable method for organizing them. It could be chronological, alphabetical, or based on document type. 4. Assess available storage space: Analyze the available space in Alex's office or home to determine the most appropriate storage system. This system could be a filing cabinet, binders, or digital storage. Depending on the space and type of documents, it's essential to select a fitting storage solution that allows easy access and retrieval. 5. Think about the long-term: Tax documents need to be stored for several years, so the filing system must be adaptable to accommodate new documents and handle changes in tax laws and requirements. It should also be designed with security in mind – protecting sensitive documents from potential theft, damage, or loss. Once Skylar has a thorough understanding of Alex's needs, he can create a tailored filing system, making it easier for Alex to manage and store his tax documents. This efficient system will ultimately save time, minimize stress, and ensure that Alex's records are properly maintained and available when needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, in a turn of fate for the better, Jayasurya, a young and ambitious psychiatrist from a prestigious medical college, came to work at the hospital. He was driven by his innate desire to help those who were less fortunate, having grown up in a home where his parents instilled in him a sense of justice and empathy for others. Jayasurya's arrival at the small-town hospital marked the beginning of change, as he breathed new life into the establishment with his innovative ideas and boundless energy. The hospital's lifeline continued with the introduction of Rakhi Devadas, who was recently appointed as the Managing Director, after obtaining her hospital management degree from a renowned institution in the United States. Rakhi was driven by a personal mission; having seen the effects of mental health issues within her own family, she knew that she wanted to dedicate her life to helping those who suffered from similar conditions. Her educational background and worldly experiences provided her with the tools necessary to transform the small-town institution into a well-regarded center for mental health care. Despite their shared goal of helping the patients within the hospital, tensions soon began to arise between Jayasurya and Rakhi Devadas. Rakhi, driven by the need for structure and efficient management, enforced strict ways of dealing with the patients, believing that keeping them controlled and confined would lead to a quicker resolution of their mental health issues. Jayasurya, on the other hand, believed that treating the patients with compassion and providing them with opportunities to express themselves and their emotions would lead to a healthier state of mind. The situation deteriorated further when Ruben Isaac, a young and charismatic social worker who recently joined the hospital's staff, began advocating for a more liberal approach to treating the patients. Ruben believed that giving the patients more freedom and the chance to interact with others in a safe and nurturing environment would have a significantly positive impact on their mental health. This only served to intensify the debate that was already brewing between Jayasurya and Rakhi. As the discord between the hospital staff escalated, the patients bore the brunt of the inconsistency between the approaches that were being employed in their care. Some of the patients seemed to respond positively to Rakhi's strict regime, while others showed vast improvements under the more nurturing and empathetic care provided by Jayasurya and Ruben. Despite their differences, the three worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those who came to their hospital seeking help. As their stories intertwined, they began to realize that perhaps there was merit to each approach, and compromise was possible. They also started to understand that every patient was unique, and what worked for one individual might not be the same for another. In time, they set aside their egos and chose the path of collaboration. By combining their distinct skills and experiences, they were able to create a healing environment that prioritized the individual needs of every patient. As they continued to learn from one another and pool their knowledge, the hospital began to prosper. The small-town mental hospital, which had once been on the brink of closure, soon became a haven for those suffering from mental health issues. Patients from all walks of life were welcomed with open arms, bearing witness to the transformational power of unified thought and action. The events that transpired at the hospital serve as a poignant reminder that by putting aside our differences and working together, we can aspire to create a world that attends to the needs of each individual, regardless of the challenges that they face."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Article: A qualified doctor who rarely practiced but instead devoted his life to writing. He once said: \\"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my lover.\\" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, was a great playwright and one of the masters of the modern short story. When Chekhov entered the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, he started to publish hundreds of comic short stories to support his family. After he graduated, he wrote regularly for a local daily newspaper. As a writer he was extremely fast, often producing a short story in an hour or less. Chekhov's medical and science experience can be seen through the indifference many of his characters show to tragic events. In 1892, he became a full time writer and published some of his most memorable stories. Chekhov often wrote about the sufferings of life in small town Russia. Tragic events control his characters who are filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays. He made up for this with his exciting technique for developing drama within his characters. Chekhov's works combined the calm attitude of a scientist and doctor with the sensitivity of an artist. Some of Chekhov's works were translated into Chinese as early as the 1940s. One of his famous stories, The Man in a Shell, about a school teacher's extraordinarily orderly life, was selected as a text for Chinese senior students. Question: Which of the following adjectives can't be used to describe Chekhov? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Warm-hearted.\\"?

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Durer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Did Durer keep his drawing designs?\\" is \\"The drawings were destroyed while carving the wood\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the information provided in the paragraph, Durer's drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the woodblock. He either drew his designs directly onto the woodblock or glued a paper drawing to the block. In both cases, the drawings were lost in the process of carving the wood. This means that Durer did not keep his drawing designs as they were an integral part of the woodcut production process and were not preserved beyond that stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the aftermath of the First World War, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks. These events overlapped, with both happening during the Greek genocide (1914-1922), a period during which, according to various sources, Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Help as much as you can. This was 20 years ago, maybe. My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What should i do get over a girl? How do I get over a girl I cannot be with?","completion":"While both of these questions have similar themes and may lead to similar advice, they have slightly different meanings: 1. \\"What should I do get over a girl?\\" In this question, the person is asking for advice or steps for getting over a girl or a romantic interest they are emotionally attached to. The specific reason for wanting to get over her is not mentioned. It could be due to a breakup, unrequited love, or any other reason that makes it necessary for them to move on from their feelings for this girl. 2. \\"How do I get over a girl I cannot be with?\\" This question is more specific about the reason behind needing to get over the girl. In this case, the person acknowledges that they cannot be with her, possibly due to external circumstances, personal choices, or other barriers that prevent them from being together. The focus is on coping with the feelings that arise from the impossibility of the relationship. To answer both of these questions, here are some general steps and advice for getting over a girl or romantic interest: 1. Acceptance: The first step towards healing is recognizing and accepting that the relationship has ended, or you cannot be with her. This involves acknowledging the reality and letting go of any hope or expectations for a future together. 2. Give yourself time to grieve: It is natural to feel sad, angry, or confused after a breakup, or when you realize that you cannot be with the person you desire. Allow yourself to experience these emotions without judgment or self-blame. 3. Cut off contact: If it is not possible to maintain a healthy, casual friendship with the girl, it might be helpful to cut off contact temporarily. Create some distance between you and the person, both physically and virtually (on social media, for instance). 4. Focus on self-improvement: Invest in yourself by engaging in activities that make you feel good and help you grow as an individual. This could include exercising, developing new hobbies, learning new skills, reading, or joining social clubs. 5. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. They can provide a listening ear and offer constructive advice. Additionally, you may consider seeking professional help from a therapist if your emotions are overwhelming you. 6. Create new memories: Start participating in new experiences that can create new, positive memories without the presence of the girl you are trying to get over. This helps reshape your view of life and rebuild your identity without her. 7. Set new goals: Set new personal or professional goals to work towards. This can help you focus on your growth and future, rather than dwelling on the past. 8. Stay patient: Healing takes time, and getting over someone does not happen overnight. Be patient with yourself, and know that it is okay for the process to take a while. In summary, while both questions are centered around dealing with feelings for a girl, the main difference lies in the specificity of the situation - whether the motivation for moving on is unspecified or due to acknowledging that they cannot be with the person in question. Regardless, the recommendations to deal with the emotions arising from either situation are quite similar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, his dream is rudely interrupted by a professional baseball star named Kiichiro Naito, played by Shinichi Tsutsumi. Seeking revenge for this interruption, Kimihiko vows to become a professional baseball player himself, hoping to outshine and outperform Kiichiro Naito on the playing field. His decision to pursue a career in professional baseball represents his determination to prove himself and compete against the person who spoiled his chance to fulfill his dream with a maiko. While Kimihiko focuses on his quest for revenge, his ex-girlfriend Fujiko decides to become an apprentice geisha, likely fueled by her own desires and aspirations. This further complicates the plot, as Kimihiko's past connection to Fujiko and her new venture into the world of maiko brings another layer of emotion and intrigue to the story. Throughout the movie, Kimihiko and Naito engage in a fierce rivalry where they try to out-do each other in various arenas apart from just baseball. This includes K-1 (a form of kickboxing), cooking, acting, and even politics. This intense competition between the two characters serves to not only provide entertainment and a dose of humor to the movie but also allows both characters to grow and develop in their respective pursuits. As the story unfolds, the rivalry between Kimihiko and Naito, as well as the personal transformations of Kimihiko, Fujiko, and other characters, offer insights into themes like ambition, personal growth, and finding one's identity and passions in life. While the movie is filled with humor and eccentricity, it ultimately highlights the importance of chasing one’s dreams, the lengths people are willing to go for revenge, and finding fulfillment in one's own life choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is a lapping machine Suggested answer: This can take two forms. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"A lapping machine is a precision finishing device used in various industries to effectively polish and finalize various parts to achieve the desired surface finish, flatness, and geometry. This machinery works by abrading the surface of the target material, leading to its modification and optimization for its intended application. Lapping machines are essential in the manufacturing process due to their ability to produce high levels of dimensional accuracy without causing any damage to the components. It is true that lapping machines can take different forms, depending on the application and the material being processed. Generally, they can be classified into two broad categories: flat lapping machines and cylindrical lapping machines. 1. Flat Lapping Machines: Flat lapping machines are used for surface finishing or polishing flat surfaces on various materials, including ceramics, metals, glass, and plastics. These machines use a combination of abrasive particles, a lapping plate, and a liquid called \\"lapping slurry\\" that is added to improve the workpiece's movement on the plate. Flat lapping machines are further categorized into single-sided and double-sided lapping machines. Single-sided lapping machines have a single lapping plate, whereas double-sided machines have two or more plates arranged in a planetary motion. 2. Cylindrical Lapping Machines: Cylindrical lapping machines are designed to finish the external and internal surfaces of cylindrical workpieces. These machines accomplish this task using a range of lapping tools, which can either be abrasive stones or specialized lapping wheels. The lapping tools are typically mounted on a spindle, and during the lapping process, the tools work in conjunction with the workpiece to remove material and produce a finessed, polished surface. This category of lapping machines is particularly relevant in industries that heavily rely on precision-engineered cylindrical components, such as automotive, aerospace, and hydraulic equipment manufacturing. To summarize, the suggested answer is partially accurate as it points out that lapping machines can take different forms.

By Alex Finnis An 18-carat gold timepiece considered 'the Holy Grail of watches' is expected to sell for a record-breaking 16.5m at auction. The celebrated Henry Graves Supercomplication is a masterpiece of horology - the science of measuring time - and took eight years to make by hand. Swiss watchmaker Patek Philippe was commissioned to make it by New York banker Henry Graves in 1925, and it is considered to be the most complicated watch ever made.

Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract. Abstract: More than 90% of patients with so-called primary or idiopathic osteoarthritis of the hips in whom sufficient data were available to make an assessment of the normality of the hip joint at the cessation of growth clearly showed demonstrable abnormalities in the hip joint. The most common are mild acetabular dysplasia and/or pistol grip deformity. This latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis (recognized or unrecognized at the time), Legg-Perthes' disease (recognized or unrecognized at the time), multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and/or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum, as well as, in certain instances, acetabular dysplasia. When these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily, such as hemochromatosis, ochronosis, calcium pyrophosphate disease, and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis, it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or, if it does, is extraordinarily rare.

Before discussing that, let's review the entire respiratory process for better understanding: 1. Inhalation: Air is taken in through the mouth or nose, as you mentioned. The air is then warmed, moistened, and filtered as it passes through the nasal cavity and enters the throat, or pharynx. The air then travels through the larynx (voice box) and into the trachea (windpipe). 2. Trachea and bronchi: The trachea branches into two bronchi (right and left), each leading to a lung. These bronchi further divide into smaller air passages called bronchioles. 3. Lungs: Within the lungs, the bronchioles eventually end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. There are around 300 million alveoli in each lung, providing a large surface area for gas exchange. 4. Gas exchange (external respiration): In the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the blood. Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, binds to the oxygen and carries it throughout the body. 5. Internal respiration: In body tissues, hemoglobin releases oxygen, which diffuses into cells. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular metabolism, diffuses out of cells and into the blood. 6. Carbon dioxide transport: Carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs in the blood, predominantly as bicarbonate ions. 7. Exhalation: Finally, the process of exhalation takes place. The diaphragm, the main muscle used in breathing, and the intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) relax, causing the lungs to recoil. This reduction in lung volume increases the pressure inside the alveoli, forcing carbon dioxide-rich air out of the alveoli and eventually expelling it from the body through the nose and mouth as we breathe out. This last step marks the completion of the respiratory cycle. In summary, the last step of the respiratory process after carbon dioxide removal is the exhalation of air, through which carbon dioxide is expelled from the body. This is a crucial process as it maintains the delicate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body and ensures the proper functioning of our cells and organs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette!

Google is working to incorporate Google+ with its other products. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: \\"The Evolution of Local Recommendations: Google Plus Local Replaces Google Places\\" The technological world has always been a realm of constant evolution and improvement. Keeping up with the pace, Google has yet again made significant strides towards enhancing the user experience with local recommendations. The multinational tech giant has replaced Google Places with Google Plus Local, marrying the utility of personalized reviews with the power of social networking. The transition weaves Google's various products into a more cohesive, integrated interface for users. Google Places had been the go-to tool for users seeking information about local businesses such as restaurants, bars, shops, and other notable places. Its main feature was providing users with extensive listing information, compiled from web data and user reviews. However, with the evolution of Google+, Google is now broadening its horizons to enhance the accuracy and interactivity of local recommendations using crowdsourced reviews and social connections. Enter Google Plus Local, an innovative tool that harnesses the power of Google+ and integrates it with the mapping functionality of Google Maps. This easy-to-use service operates as a social layer across all elements of Google, building a more sophisticated and condensed navigational and informational landscape. It collects reviews, ratings, and other data about local businesses and organizes them all into a synchronous system. One of the most significant factors that set Google Plus Local apart from Google Places is its mainstream adoption of Zagat scores. Zagat, an established restaurant review brand, was acquired by Google in 2011. Since then, it has played an influential role in Google's local business rating system. Google Plus Local uses the 30-point rating system from Zagat to provide users with a comprehensive overview of businesses. The score, based on user reviews, covers various aspects like food quality, decor, service, and cost, providing valuable insights and helping users make an informed choice based on their preferences and budget. But the revamping doesn't stop there. Along with the Zagat score, Google Plus Local incorporates reviews from users' friends and connections on Google+. This feature augments the social interaction on the platform, allowing users to see trustworthy and personalized reviews from friends and other community members. It introduces an element of transparency and authenticity, since it showcases genuine experiences from known individuals, which often have more impact than anonymous reviews. Google Plus Local isn't just an update; it's a significant upgrade. The integration of Google+ with Google's other products creates a more contiguous and interactive user experience. Google’s ardent drive to encourage users to adopt Google+ as their primary social networking platform is evident in this synchronised ecosystem. Google Plus Local serves as a milestone in Google’s plans to weave Google+ into every aspect of its product ecosystem and represents an integral part of its holistic approach to digital consumer services. In conclusion, Google's replacement of Google Places with Google Plus Local marks a significant shift in their approach to providing local recommendations. With the integration of Zagat scoring and reviews from Google+ users' friends, this tool offers detailed and reliable information about local businesses. As Google continues to incorporate Google+ with its other products, users can now look forward to a seamless, more personalized user experience. The introduction of Google Plus Local indeed highlights Google’s commitment to innovation and improved usability, reinforcing its dominance in the digital navigation and recommendation industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Associated Press) This Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2018, photo provided by the Omro Police Department in Omro, Wis., shows police officers trying to remove a 4-foot-long Ball python that was discovered wrapped around a car engine. It took hours to unwind and coax the snake from the engine compartment. Police say the snake escaped... (Associated Press) OMRO, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin motorist was having car trouble when he pulled over to find a slithering surprise. Chris Nguyen opened the hood of his mother's SUV. Inside, he found a 4-foot-long ball python. Police in Omro responded. They tried to wriggle the snake free and called Menasha snake rescuer Steve Keller for help. WLUK-TV reports it took hours to free the snake, which had wrapped itself around the engine. The snake's owner said it had been missing for more than a month. It's illegal to have such a snake in Omro, so the owner was fined 313. Police say they'll dismiss the ticket if the owner pays for the SUV's damages, which fittingly include a displaced serpentine belt. Keller says he'll adopt the python. ___ Information from: WLUK-TV, http://www.fox11online.com ||||| OMRO, Wis. (WLUK) -- A driver and her son having some car trouble pull over and pop open the hood -- to find themselves staring into a serpent's eyes. \\"I've never done anything like this before in my life! Most of my rescues are taking them out of people's houses,\\" said Steve Keller. Keller is the self-proclaimed \\"Snake Man\\" who pulled the serpent from the woman's SUV. The slithering surprise sent Omro police racing to Keller for help. They brought the \\"Snake Man\\" in for backup when the ball python wrapped itself tight around an unsuspecting driver's engine. \\"I don't know why I risked my own body for a snake, but I did, it's what I do,\\" Keller said. Keller says the python, native to Africa and used to much warmer temperatures, found heat under the hood and got cozy. \\"Getting one unwrapped from an engine block was not fun. I've got all kinds of cuts and bruises on my arms from trying to dig into this thing and try to get him out in one piece,\\" Keller said. It took hours, a tow truck and a \\"Snake Man\\" to get the stubborn python out. The SUV's engine was damaged by the snake. The animal is also being treated for cuts and burns. \\"We got him out in one piece, but the burns could turn into a fatality in a couple of weeks; we don't know until it has some time to heal,\\" said Keller. The \\"Snake Man\\" has rescued over 500 of these critters in the past 12 years. Keller says this rescue was a first, and one of his toughest. Police say the snake escaped from its owner more than a month ago. Omro police say it's illegal to own a ball python and they've fined the snake's owner 313. |||||Summary:","completion":"In Omro, Wisconsin, a motorist named Chris Nguyen found himself facing an unexpected issue when he discovered a 4-foot-long ball python wrapped around his mother's SUV engine. The snake had reportedly been missing from its owner for over a month and had found refuge in the warm engine compartment. After several hours and assistance from police officers and snake rescuer Steve Keller, the python was successfully removed. The snake is currently being treated for cuts and burns from the ordeal. Owning a ball python is illegal in Omro, and the snake's owner was consequently fined 313. The fine may be dismissed if the owner pays for the SUV damages, which include a displaced serpentine belt. Snake rescuer Steve Keller has expressed intentions to adopt the python."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Which United States Marine Corps aviator preceded United States Navy Commander Scott Carpenter as one of the first Americans in space? A:","completion":"The United States Marine Corps aviator who preceded United States Navy Commander Scott Carpenter as one of the first Americans in space was Marine Lieutenant Colonel John Glenn. John Glenn, born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, was a highly decorated fighter pilot during World War II and the Korean War, who later became a test pilot before being selected as a member of NASA's Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959. John Glenn's historic spaceflight took place on February 20, 1962, aboard the Mercury-Atlas 6 spacecraft, named Friendship 7. During this mission, he became the first American to orbit the Earth, making three orbits in just under five hours. This achievement showcased American ingenuity and progress in the early stages of the Space Race against the Soviet Union, which had already put cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit about a year earlier on April 12, 1961. Scott Carpenter, who was also part of NASA's original Mercury Seven group, followed John Glenn on May 24, 1962, aboard the Mercury-Atlas 7 spacecraft, named Aurora 7. Carpenter successfully orbited Earth three times as well, but various complications during his mission caused a delay in his landing and recovery. It is important to note that both John Glenn and Scott Carpenter were pioneers in American space exploration, laying vital groundwork for future achievements such as the Apollo Moon landings and helping the United States become a global leader in space technology. After their careers as astronauts, both men continued to be involved in public service: Glenn served as a United States Senator from Ohio, and Carpenter pursued careers in oceanographic research and environmental conservation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anatomically, the pancreas is divided into the head of pancreas, the neck of pancreas, the body of pancreas, and the tail of pancreas. The head is surrounded by the duodenum in its concavity. The head surrounds two blood vessels, the superior mesenteric artery and vein. From the back of the head emerges a small uncinate process which extends to the back of the superior mesenteric vein and ends at the superior mesenteric artery. The neck is about 2.5 cm (1 in) long and lies between the head and the body and in front of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Its front upper surface supports the pylorus (the base) of the stomach. The neck arises from the left upper part of the front of the head. It is directed first upward and forward, and then upward and to the left to join the body; it is somewhat flattened from above downward and backward. On the right it is grooved by the gastroduodenal artery. The body is the largest part of the pancreas and lies behind the pylorus, at the same level as the transpyloric plane.

Would \\"For United States individual income tax, adjusted gross income (AGI) is total gross income minus specific reductions.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"While your provided statement begins to define adjusted gross income (AGI), it does not directly address modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Here's a more comprehensive answer: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is a measure used by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits, deductions, and credits. MAGI is calculated by taking your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and adding back specific items that have been previously excluded or deducted from the computation of your AGI. To understand MAGI, it's essential to know what AGI is. As you mentioned, AGI is the total gross income (all sources of income such as wages, interests, dividends, and capital gains) minus specific reductions (also known as adjustments or deductions, e.g., educator expenses, student loan interest, alimony payments, and contributions to retirement accounts). After determining the AGI, certain items excluded or deducted from your AGI are added back to calculate your MAGI. Depending on your tax situation, these items may include: 1. Deduction for student loan interest 2. Deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses 3. Excluded foreign earned income and housing costs 4. Nontaxable Social Security benefits 5. Tax-exempt interest income 6. Deduction for IRA contributions It's essential to understand that the specific additions may differ depending on the tax provision you're trying to qualify for, such as Roth IRA contributions, American Opportunity Tax Credit, or the Premium Tax Credit under the Affordable Care Act. In summary, Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is a measure used by the IRS to determine your eligibility for specific tax benefits.

Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner.

However, the other two are returned by more considerate people: Texas cowboy James Houston and teacher Jean Lawrence. They stay for dinner and soon become good friends with the three men and Madame Tanya. James and Jean also fall in love with each other, delighting the three men.

United‘s match Sunday against the New York Red Bulls marks both the end of a critical homestand and the start of an onerous stretch, a late-summer overlap that promises to set the tone for the MLS club’s playoff push. It’s the last of four consecutive dates at RFK Stadium and the beginning of four games across 12 days against Eastern Conference opponents. Given the current circumstances and imminent demands, United is famished for three points against its archrivals. “You’ve got to focus on both aspects” of the next two weeks, Coach Ben Olsen said Friday, “but most of that focus is on Sunday and taking care of business here at home, putting up another win and continuing to improve because each of the last three games we’ve taken a step forward. The pieces are fitting in; now it’s important to go on a run.” [There’s lots of soccer on TV this weekend. Here’s where you can watch.] United (6-8-9, 27 points) has shown marked improvement in recent weeks, though only the 2-0 victory over reigning champion Portland last weekend was fully satisfying. The previous two outings — draws against Montreal and Philadelphia — were marred by lost leads and dropped points. United is seeking to win consecutive games for the first time this season. (It has not lost two in a row, either.) By no means would a draw or defeat spoil United’s playoff aim; 10 games remain after Sunday, and D.C. was tied for the conference’s sixth and last postseason berth entering the weekend. But four of the next five are on the road — and United is not a good away team (1-4-6 with seven goals scored). The busiest stretch of the year will accelerate with a trip to Montreal on Wednesday, a home game against Chicago next Saturday, then a midweek visit to New York City FC five days later. After a break for World Cup qualifiers, United will go to Red Bull Arena on Sept. 11. “I hate when you say ‘must-win games,’ but it kind of has that feel,” captain Bobby Boswell said. “If we go out and win, I think a lot of teams look at us and say, ‘This team wants to be in the playoffs, and when they show up, they are a real contender.’ “We believe that; I think not a lot of people watching us believe that. If we can show what we’re capable of, we can put some fear into other people. But if we lay an egg, people will say, ‘It’s symbolic of their season.’ ” Near the bottom of league scoring all summer, United is showing signs of life in the attack. Improved rhythm and ball movement led to back-to-back multiple goal performances for the first time this year. Consistency should pay dividends, as Olsen appears to have settled on his midfield and forward after months of interchange: Marcelo Sarvas in defensive midfield, Jared Jeffrey and Luciano Acosta in central midfield, Lloyd Sam and Patrick Nyarko on the flanks, and Patrick Mullins at striker. Nick DeLeon, Lamar Neagle, Alvaro Saborio and Kennedy Igboananike await their turn. The Red Bulls (10-9-6, 36 points) will steam into RFK on a 3-0-4 roll in league play and 5-0-5 in all competitions, the last setback coming July 3 against NYCFC at Yankee Stadium. Coach Jesse Marsch mixed regulars and reserves for their midweek CONCACAF Champions League match in San Salvador, a 1-1 draw with Alianza. The stream of results has come despite long-term injuries to four regulars: Defenders Gideon Baah (broken leg) and Connor Lade (knee) are out for the year, defender Damien Perrinelle (ankle) will miss several more weeks and midfielder Dax McCarty, a former United captain, is recovering from a leg fracture. “There’s a good vibe with this group right now,” Olsen said. “We are primed to improve and go on a run, but that means nothing if you don’t step out Sunday and understand what it’s going to take to beat a very good Red Bulls team.” Olsen will return to the sideline after serving a one-game suspension for an ejection against Philadelphia. Sam will face his former team for the first time since United acquired him July 7. “It’s huge, not just because it’s New York but the timing and where we are at, where we can be if we come out with three points,” Boswell said. “It’s a big deal.” Assistant coach Chad Ashton has won both games when filling in for the suspended Olsen this season. Including the last few minutes of the Philadelphia match two weeks ago, when Olsen was ejected and Steve Birnbaum scored in added time, Ashton’s goal differential is plus-six. The Insider could not resist, tongue in cheek, raising those statistics with Olsen. Clearly, he needs to step aside. “I consider it every day,” Olsen said. “I made the recommendation upstairs” to the front office. On a serious note: “Listen, Chad has been a big part of this coaching staff for a while. He doesn’t get any glory. He is a real soldier for this club.” With the college soccer season launching (women kick off today, men next Friday), MLS teams will keep a close eye on their homegrown prospects. For United, that means Eryk Williamson, a sophomore attacker at the University of Maryland. Barring major injury, an alarming drop in form or considerable overseas offers, United hopes to sign him to a homegrown contract after this college season, the Insider has learned. (To maintain NCAA eligibility, he won’t sign a pro deal until he’s sure of leaving school.) Williamson, 19, is a U.S. under-20 national team starter from Alexandria, Va. Last fall at Maryland, he started in all but one of his 20 appearances and posted five goals and three assists. The Terrapins — Big Ten favorites who are ranked No. 4 in the NSCAA preseason poll — will open the season next Friday against No. 16 UCLA at StubHub Center in Carson, Calif. The home opener at Ludwig Field is Aug. 29 against Hartford, followed by a local clash with visiting Georgetown on Sept. 2. United’s stretch of home matches has illuminated an issue with the stadium lights: Several bulbs appear dark. It doesn’t seem to affect TV coverage, and except for spectators glaring skyward, the audience probably hasn’t noticed. Here’s the explanation from Events DC, the organization that manages the facility: The bank of lights that show two rows of lights off are emergency lights that will turn on in case of a power outage via the backup generator. The other tower lights that appear to be out have been addressed since the beginning of this month, one tower of lights at a time. In order to change these lights (lanterns), electricians need to go on the roof, suspend from a harness and change manually. For safety reasons, given the heat this month, they have only been able to work in the early morning hours. This maintenance is an on-going process as light lanterns that work today may be out tomorrow. The on-field visibility is of utmost importance and has not been impeded during this routine maintenance. Lightning, not lighting, might be an issue Sunday: A weather front is expected to crash through the Washington area, with a high chance of thunderstorms throughout the afternoon. ESPN will carry the match, with coverage starting at 3 p.m. and kickoff shortly thereafter. Jonathan Yardley and Taylor Twellman are the announcers. The game is also available on ESPN Deportes, the WatchESPN app and ESPN3.com. The referee is Ismail Elfath. After a weather-related postponement Wednesday, the Richmond Kickers (11-6-6) will return to action Sunday against Orlando City B (8-8-7) in Melbourne, Fla. The Kickers are unbeaten in seven straight (6-0-1) and fifth in the USL’s 14-team Eastern Conference with seven regular season matches left. United midfielder Miguel Aguilar is scheduled to report. Goalkeeper Andrew Dykstra is also likely. Wednesday’s home game against the Charleston Battery was halted in the 21st minute because of a thunderstorm. Four United players started: goalkeeper Travis Worra, defenders Jalen Robinson and Luke Mishu, and midfielder Julian Buescher. D.C.

Please answer the following question: - The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - The heavy items sink to the bottom - The lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - As the river flows the sediment is moved - The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step in the process of sediment transportation, as described in the sequence of events, is when the sediment rolls down a hill towards a river. This step, also known as erosion, involves the detachment and movement of soil and rock fragments by gravity, water, wind, or ice. In this context, the primary agent of erosion is gravity, as it drives soil and rocks to roll down a hill or slope. This downhill movement of sediment is induced by factors such as the topography and steepness of the slope, the amount and type of precipitation, the composition and stability of soil, and the presence or absence of vegetation cover. Erosion is crucial in the process of sediment transportation, as it sets the stage for subsequent steps in the sediment cycle. The dislodged sediment, consisting of various particles in different shapes, sizes, and densities, then reaches the river where the heavy items sink to the bottom, and the lighter ones float on the top and in convection cycles. As the river flows, the sediment is eventually transported and reaches other bodies of water, such as lakes or the ocean. Understanding this process is essential in the study of geology and geomorphology. It helps scientists comprehend the dynamic nature of Earth's surface, the movement of sediments and nutrients, and the formation of various geological features such as deltas, beaches, and sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, knowing the factors influencing sediment transportation allows us to better manage and mitigate the potential impacts of erosion, such as reduced soil fertility, water pollution, and the loss of valuable land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Coming off their win against the Eagles, the Redskins had a short turnaround and traveled to Cowboys Stadium to take on their hated rival the Dallas Cowboys for the 2012 edition of the annual Thanksgiving Day game. Washington had reason to be nervous, as they were 1-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 0-6 against Dallas. In the first, Washington got the ball first, but went three-and-out. After a Sav Rocca punt, Dallas had decent field position, and quickly reached the red zone. However, Washington's defense then stiffened, and held Dallas to a Dan Bailey 30-yard field goal. The teams then exchanged punts, and the first quarter concluded without any further scoring. In the second, Washington had the ball inside their own 35, and quarterback Robert Griffin III used a play-action pass, and found a streaking Aldrick Robinson for a 68-yard strike, and Washington took its first lead of the game, at 7-3. On Dallas' ensuing possession, Dallas moved the ball into Washington territory, but after Tony Romo completed an 11-yard pass to Dez Bryant that had Dallas in Washington territory, Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson hit him, and dislodged the football, which was subsequently recovered by safety DeJon Gomes into Dallas territory. Washington would capitalize, with their drive culminating in an Alfred Morris 1-yard touchdown run to extend Washington's advantage to 14-3. Dallas would then punt after just three plays, and Washington marched near midfield, before Griffin connected with wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on across the middle, and Garcon proceeded to streak to the endzone for a 59-yard score, and Washington led 21-3 with just over 2 minutes remaining in the half. Dallas would attempt to run a two-minute drill, but Romo's pass, intended for Cole Beasley was intercepted by DeAngelo Hall and returned inside the Dallas 25. With mere seconds remaining in the half, Griffin found Santana Moss in the corner of the endzone for a score, and a 28-3 halftime lead. In the third, Dallas marched down the field on their opening possession, but the drive stalled again, and Dallas settled for another Bailey field goal, this time from 33 yards out. The majority of the rest of the quarter proved to be a defensive struggle, as Romo was intercepted again, this time by London Fletcher, but Washington could not capitalize on it. After a Rocca punt, Dallas was pinned inside their 20, but Romo connected with a wide-open Dez Bryant, who streaked 85 yards to the end zone, and before you could blink, Dallas was back in the game, at 28-13 Washington. Going into the fourth, Washington was driving, in an attempt to extend their lead back to three scores. They would succeed in this endeavor, as Griffin found tight end Niles Paul for a 30-yard touchdown on third-and-inches, and Washington took a 35-13 lead with just under 13 minutes to go. Dallas, however, would not give up, as expected. To save time, Dallas ran a no-huddle offense, and was able to march down the field, and find Felix Jones for a 10-yard touchdown, and a subsequent quarterback draw by Romo cut the lead to 35-21 with just under 10 minutes remaining. On Washington's next possession, disaster struck. Robert Griffin III lofted a throw over the middle that he overthrew horribly, and it was easily intercepted by Charlie Peprah and returned inside the Washington 20. However, Washington's defense put Dallas into a 4th down situation, but Romo found Dez Bryant in the left corner of the end zone, and with over 8 minutes remaining, Dallas was now within a touchdown, as Washington's lead was merely 35-28. With his mettle about to be tested, Robert Griffin III led an efficient, clock-chewing drive that concluded with a Kai Forbath 48-yard field goal to extend Washington's advantage to 38-28 with just under three minutes remaining. Dallas, needing a touchdown, onside kick recovery, and field goal to send it to overtime, again marched into Washington territory, but couldn't get to the endzone, as Dez Bryant caught a pass in the endzone that was dislodged at the last minute by Madieu Williams, and Dallas had to settle for a 51-yard field goal by Bailey. This cut the score to 38-31, and Dallas lined up for an onside kick, needing a touchdown to tie the game, with 18 seconds remaining. However, it was recovered by DeAngelo Hall and returned to the Dallas 2, as Hall opted not to score, instead letting Robert Griffin III kneel-down to seal the deal. Griffin went 20-for-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, becoming the first rookie QB in NFL history to throw 4 passing touchdowns in back-to-back games. With the win, Washington improved to 5-6, 2-1 in the NFC East, and into second place in the NFC East by virtue of the tiebreaker over Dallas. Washington also won its first Thanksgiving game since the 1973 season, when they defeated the Detroit Lions. Washington improved to 2-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 1-6 against Dallas.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'.

Wal-mart is often associated with affordability and cost cutting at the expense of quality. Therefore, the sentence implies that the movie might not have been able to achieve the same level of success as it intended, due to these limitations.

Summarize this article: Nevada law prohibits gun owners from aiding or permitting a child to have access to a firearm. You cannot be convicted of a violation of this law if you keep your firearms in a secured locked container. To provide additional protection, keep the container in a place where children in the household can't get to it, such as in the top of a closet. Although not required by Nevada law, disassembling or locking your firearms before storing them helps protect children. If they somehow stumble upon your firearms, they won't be able to fire them if they are locked or disassembled. You can get a safety kit with cable-style locks to protect your firearms at your local police or sheriff's department. For a list of law enforcement agencies in Nevada that have safety kits available, visit https://www.projectchildsafe.org/safety/safety-kit/Nevada. Even if you don't disassemble your firearms, make sure they're unloaded before you store them. Keep the ammunition apart from your firearms so that even if children happen to access your firearms, they can't access the ammunition. Your ammunition should also be stored in a locked container. Ammunition can be dangerous for children even if not loaded in a weapon. While Nevada law doesn't require you to store your ammunition separately from your firearms, this will keep children in your household safer. Make sure any children in your household are aware of firearms and how they should act around them. Instruct them that if they ever see a gun, even one that looks like a toy, they should not touch it and tell an adult immediately. If there are adolescents or teenagers in your household who are trained to use firearms, such as for hunting or for target practice, make sure they understand that they should never touch or use a firearm without an adult present. Discourage children from snooping around the house for guns, even if they just want to look at it. Tell them that guns are not toys. Summary:","completion":"Nevada law prohibits gun owners from allowing children access to firearms and recommends storing firearms in a secured locked container. To enhance safety, disassemble or lock firearms before storage, and keep ammunition separate in a locked container. Obtain safety kits from local law enforcement agencies and educate children about firearm safety, instructing them not to touch guns and to inform an adult immediately if they find one.

Dr. Barden was a former winner of the game. Iris reluctantly accepts. The next day at Lambrick's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, an elderly, paralyzed woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Cal; Amy; and Conway, an alcoholic debtor. A steak and fois gras dinner is served but, Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepherd then offers her 10,000 to compromise her principles, and so she eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers Conway 10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines he then offers him 50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch. Conway accepts the 50,000 and reluctantly drinks the Scotch. After dinner ends, the game begins.

For week four, the Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks when they hosted the 1-2 Packers, the Bears having led the all-time series 93-89-2, but the Packers had won 9 of the previous 11 games. On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers.

I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth.

Star ratings are subjective and can vary depending on individual experiences and expectations. Additionally, this statement is too brief to make a fair judgment and provide a detailed and long answer. However, let's try to give a general analysis based on this statement. The reviewer appears to be experiencing difficulties in updating something, possibly a device or an application, while using a Jio sim card. Jio is a telecommunications company in India which provides primarily mobile network services, including data, voice, and messaging. From the perspective of the reviewer who has encountered this issue, they could be experiencing frustration and dissatisfaction due to the inability to update, which may have prevented them from utilizing particular features or applications they consider essential. Based on this information, it could be inferred that they might assign a low star rating, such as ★ or ★★. However, it's important to consider if this issue is limited to the Jio sim or if others have experienced similar problems, as isolated issues can sometimes result from individual user errors or technical difficulties unrelated to the product or service itself. Also, consider the user's overall experience and satisfaction with other aspects of the product or service. The issue they are facing might not be significant enough to strongly influence their overall rating. In summary, a precise star rating cannot be determined from the statement alone as it lacks the necessary context and information. It's also essential to evaluate other factors, such as the general sentiment of other users, technical variables, and the scope of the problem before accurately assigning a star rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:In July 2011, Ball signed a new three-year contract, which extended his stay at the Pride Park club until at least 2014. Ball scored his first senior goal for the club in a 2–1 win at home to Bristol City on 10 December 2011. Ball then scored the opening goal of the game against West Ham which was a great curling effort form the edge of the area after being played in by Nathan Tyson, this was the second former England goal keeper (Robert Green) he had scored against after scoring his first goal against David James. Ball scored his 3rd goal for derby, which proved to be the winner against Coventry City, once again this proved to be a goal against an internationally capped goal keeper in Joe Murphy who at the time had been capped twice by the Republic of Ireland. Ball became a regular in the Rams matchday 16 until he picked up an ankle injury in a reserves game against Belper Town on 26 March 2012. Ball returned from injury a 3–2 reserve win against Sunderland Reserves in the Totesport Cup semi-final game on 19 April 2012, playing the whole 90 minutes in central defence.
