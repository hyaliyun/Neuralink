In the given scenario, a large number of Americans, including a significant number in Arizona, have lost their health insurance or have no health insurance at all. 3. A large number of uninsured people indicates limited access to healthcare for a considerable part of the population. 4. The fact that the number of uninsured people has increased during President Bush's watch suggests that there is an ongoing issue with the healthcare system. 5.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In West Virginia, Charles \\"Boomer\\" Baxter is setting mountain top-depletion explosives. He detonates the TNT, and an unprecedented earthquake devastates the area. A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter. They decide to set explosives to block the fault's path. Later, when it reaches the park, Boomer detonates the explosives causing the fault to stop just short of reaching the volcano, but costing Boomer's life.

Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter.

Sound waves are created as the air vibrates in response to a person's speech or other sounds. A second person's ear collects these sound waves and converts them into nerve impulses which their brain interprets as sound. In normal speech these waves travel through the air, but with a tin can telephone the waves are transmitted through an additional medium of cups and string. What's the best answer to this question: does a tin can and string really work?","completion":"To determine the best answer for whether a tin can telephone really works, we need to examine the components of the system and the effectiveness of sound transmission. Step 1: Understand a tin can telephone system A tin can telephone consists of two tin cans (or plastic cups) connected by a taut string. The assumption is that when a person talks into one can, sound travels through the string and is audible to the listener at the other can. Step 2: Assess the effectiveness of sound transmission The key factor in a tin can telephone's success lies in preserving the integrity of the sound waves as they travel through the system. Sound waves need a medium to propagate, and the taut string provides that medium. When a person speaks into a can, the can vibrates, causing the string to vibrate as well. These vibrations travel along the string to the other can, where they are converted back into sound waves. Step 3: Consider factors that influence sound quality Various factors influence the sound quality of a tin can telephone: 1. Material: The cans and string must be made of materials that effectively transmit sound vibrations. Tin cans or plastic cups usually work well for the cans, while a tightly-stretched nylon string is a good choice for the string. 2. String tension: The string must be taut to maintain the integrity of the sound waves. A loose string will dampen vibrations and decrease sound quality. 3. Distance: The length of the string affects the sound quality. The longer the string, the more energy is lost in transmission, decreasing the sound quality. After considering these factors and the means through which a tin can telephone functions, the best answer to the question is: Yes, a tin can and string can really work as a simplistic means of communication, transmitting sound between two points. However, the effectiveness and quality of sound largely depend on the materials used, string tension, and distance between the cans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which team allowed the most points in the first quarter?","completion":"Title: Which Team Allowed the Most Points in the First Quarter? Hi, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about basketball. 🏀 Do you like watching basketball games? In basketball, two teams play against each other, and they try to score points by putting the ball through the hoop. The team that scores the most points wins! But sometimes, teams have a hard time defending their hoop, which means they let the other team score many points. We are going to find out which team allowed the most points in the first quarter. In a basketball game, there are four quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes long. The first quarter is the start of the game. Sometimes, teams start the game slowly, maybe because they are nervous, or they are not warmed-up, or they are just having a bad day. Now, let's talk about the team that allowed the most points in the first quarter. This can change every season since teams play many games and the players might change too. In the NBA (that's the professional basketball league in the USA 🇺🇸), it is common for teams to give up about 25 to 30 points in the first quarter. But, sometimes teams end up giving up lots more points! 😮 To find out which team allowed the most points in the first quarter, you can look up the basketball statistics. The statistics will tell you how many points each team scored and how many they let other teams score. You can find this information online or in the sports section of a newspaper. Once you find the statistics, you should look for the team that has the highest number of points allowed in the first quarter. That is the team that let other teams score the most points! Oh no! 🙁 But, don't worry, even if a team has a bad start in the first quarter, they can still come back and win the game. That's the beauty of sports! 😊 So now you know how to find which team allowed the most points in the first quarter. It's fun to learn about basketball, isn't it? But remember, playing basketball is even more fun. Let's go grab a ball and shoot some hoops! 🎉 Happy playing, and remember to always have fun! 🌟"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. and Russian ambassadors to the United Nations have exchanged a flurry of Twitter posts about the controversial punk rock band Pussy Riot. Meanwhile, Russian media suggested a Russian athlete in the Sochi Games may have been sporting an image supporting Pussy Riot on his snowboard Thursday in what could be the Olympics' first protest. In the diplomatic dispute, Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, apparently initiated the exchange with a Russian counterpart when she tweeted Wednesday about meeting formerly imprisoned band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, both of whom were released in December. Power posted a photograph of herself with the two punk rockers, who \\"came by to discuss their time in jail,\\" Power tweeted. She also stated: \\"Met some brave 'troublemakers' today.\\" . Power subsequently tweeted: \\"I asked #PussyRiot if they were afraid of prison. Response: No. In prison we could see the terrible conditions. It's human rights fieldwork.\\" Then the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, told a U.N. press conference that Power should join the band and invite them to play at the National Cathedral in Washington. Power responded on Twitter: \\"Ambassador Churkin, I'd be honored to go on tour with #PussyRiot -- a group of girls who speak up & stand for human rights. Will you join us?\\" Power also added: \\"I can't sing, but if #PussyRiot will have me, Amb Churkin, I say our 1st concert is for Russia's pol. prisoners. #LiveFromMatrosskayaTishina.\\" Matrosskaya Tishina is a notorious Moscow prison where opposition activists have been held. Pussy Riot tells Christiane Amanpour: 'We are free people, and free people feel no fear.\\" A third member of Pussy Riot, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released in 2012. The three members were sentenced to prison after performing a song critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February 2012. The performance was carried out in a flash-mob style. Meanwhile, the Russian state-run media agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday that Russian athlete Alexei Sobolev sported an image on his snowboard resembling \\"a female figure in a balaclava wielding a knife.\\" That image purports to resemble members of Pussy Riot because the anti-Putin, all-female band perform while wearing balaclavas, the news agency reported.

The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies. In the face of this attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet to take control of the channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade.

The context of the tweet suggests that the user is discussing something happening within a particular environment or group, referencing the slowness of events or change. By stating \\"yep, still the same one,\\" the user acknowledges that things are moving slowly, and the ellipsis after that statement may indicate a sense of frustration or resignation. However, it can also be interpreted as a more light-hearted and casual acknowledgment, which is why the sentiment is not predominantly negative. The use of \\"things happen slowly around here\\" might be seen as a mild complaint, but it does not convey strong negative emotions like anger, disappointment, or dissatisfaction.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space. - Civil Engineering History of the civil engineering profession. Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing. - Medical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. - Structural engineers analyze, design, plan, and research structural components and structural systems to achieve design goals and ensure the safety and comfort of users or occupants. Their work takes account mainly of safety, technical, economic and environmental concerns, but they may also consider aesthetic and social factors. - The term structural system or structural frame in structural engineering refers to load - resisting sub-system of a structure . The structural system transfers loads through interconnected structural components or members . Commonly used structures can be classified into five major categories , depending on the type of primary stress that may arise in the members of the structures under major design loads . However any two or more of the basic structural types described in the following may be combined in a single structure , such as a building or a bridge in order to meet the structures functional requirements . Tensile structures : Members of tensile structures are subjects to pure tension under the action of external loads . Because the tensile stress is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of members , the material of such a structure is utilized in the most efficient manner . Compressive structures : Compression structures develop mainly compressive stresses under the action of axial loads . Because compressive structures are susceptible to buckling or instability , the possibility of such a failure should be considered in their designs if necessary , adequate bracing must be provided to avoid such failures . Trusses : Trusses are composed of straight members connected at their ends by hinged connections to form a stable configuration . Because of their light weight and high strength , are among the most commonly used type of structure . Shear structures : These are structures such as reinforced concrete shear walls , which are used in multistory buildings to reduce lateral movements due to wind loads and earthquake excitations . Shear structures develop mainly in - plane shear with relatively small bending stresses under the action of external loads . Bending structures : Bending structures develop mainly bending stresses under the action of external loads . The shear stresses associated with the changes in bending moments may also be significant should be considered in their designs . - Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns). Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be design.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits Context: Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano's Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album Finn in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances. Recurring Dream contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were \\"Instinct\\", \\"Not the Girl You Think You Are\\" and \\"Everything Is Good for You\\", which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks. Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the Farewell to the World concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people. Farewell to the World was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued as to commemorate the concert's tenth anniversary.

A: Answer:","completion":"The first discovery of the moons of Jupiter was made by Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo Galilei in 1610. Hence, the correct answer is (D) Galileo. Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy, on February 15, 1564, and died in Arcetri, near Florence, on January 8, 1642. He was, without a doubt, one of the most significant figures in the history of science. His work laid the foundation for the modern scientific method and made vital contributions to the fields of astronomy, mathematics, and physics. In January 1610, while using an early prototype of the refracting telescope—an invention that he had recently improved—Galileo observed what appeared to be three small, bright objects in close proximity to Jupiter. He concluded that they were stars based on his initial observation, but as the nights passed, he noticed that they appeared to move relative to the planet. After further observation, Galileo discovered a fourth object and became convinced that these celestial bodies were not stars, but rather moons orbiting Jupiter. These discoveries had significant implications for the scientific community. Prior to this, it was widely believed that all celestial bodies revolved around the Earth in fixed orbits, a notion known as the geocentric model. However, the discovery of these moons challenged this belief and provided support for the heliocentric model—the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. Galileo's groundbreaking observations of the moons of Jupiter ultimately led to the acceptance of the heliocentric model of our solar system, which replaced the previously dominant geocentric model. This, in turn, had a profound impact on the way people understood the universe. In honor of Galileo's discovery, the four largest moons of Jupiter are now collectively known as the Galilean moons. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons have been extensively studied in the centuries since their discovery, revealing fascinating details about their geological and geophysical properties, as well as their potential to harbor life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Experts say riding horses can be effective in gaining access to autistic children. Rowan Isaacson's language and temper improved with horse/shaman therapy. His parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for Rowan's autism. Article:","completion":"Title: A Family's Journey to Mongolia: How Horses and Shamanism Helped Their Autistic Son Introduction: When the Isaacson family found themselves seeking unconventional solutions to support their autistic son, Rowan, they embarked on an extraordinary journey across Mongolia - all in search of horseback riding and shamanic healing. Their quest was fueled by a desire for deeper connection and improved communication, as well as the knowledge that experts have found horse riding to be an effective method for gaining access to autistic children. The Unconventional Treatment: For the Isaacson family, the decision to travel across Mongolia was not taken lightly. They were well aware of the significance of their autistic son's needs and were dedicated to exploring any viable options for his development. Their journey led them to a powerful combination of horse riding and meetings with shamans, which ultimately had a profound impact on Rowan's life. Despite their focus on these alternative approaches, Rowan's parents never left behind more orthodox treatments, ensuring that their son received a well-rounded and comprehensive care plan. The Therapeutic Power of Horse Riding: While horse riding might seem like an unusual therapy choice, countless experts support its benefits for autistic children. Engaging with horses allows children to develop vital skills through the gentle and non-judgmental interaction that these animals provide. This unique connection fosters a sense of self-awareness, as well as emotional and social growth, which can be challenging for autistic children to achieve through traditional methods. Rowan's Progress: Throughout the Isaacson's journey across Mongolia, they witnessed incredible progress in their son, who experienced significant improvements in both his language and temper. As a result of his time spent with horses and shamans, Rowan grew in ways his parents never imagined. They strongly believe that this unique combination was instrumental in unlocking the door to their son's development. Integrating Orthodox Treatments: While the Isaacsons were eager to explore unconventional treatments such as horse riding and shamanic therapy, they also understood the importance of integrating these alongside more traditional approaches. By maintaining a blend of methodologies, Rowan received a comprehensive and balanced treatment plan that nurtured his growth and development. Conclusion: The Isaacson family's journey across Mongolia is an inspiring story that reminds us of the extraordinary lengths parents may go to for their children. The unique blend of horse riding and shamanic healing provided Rowan with the opportunities to make remarkable progress in his overall development. This inspiring story serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes, unconventional methods may complement traditional treatments in helping children with autism reach milestones that were once considered out of reach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: While moving the antique a wooden rod fell out, but since it was just part of the chimes what was still functional? Possible A: hardware store, old clock, broom closet, puzzle, old houses Why is \\"old clock\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Old clock\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because of the context and clues provided in the question itself. The question describes a scenario involving an antique, a wooden rod falling out, and a component of chimes. By analyzing each possible answer and using human common sense, we can deduce which answer is the most appropriate. 1. Hardware store: While a hardware store may carry items to fix an antique, it is not the most fitting answer, as the question asks what is still functional after the wooden rod fell out. The hardware store is unrelated to the actual functioning of the object in question. 2. Old clock: When thinking of antiques that contain chimes and a potentially wooden rod, an old clock instantly comes to mind. Clocks are not only one of the most common antiques but also have chimes as an integral part of their functionality. Grandfather clocks, cuckoo clocks, and mantle clocks with chimes often have wooden components. Therefore, when a wooden rod connected to the chimes falls out of an antique, it is reasonable to assume that an old clock is still functional despite the dislodged rod. 3. Broom closet: This answer does not make much sense in the given context, as a broom closet is an unrelated object. It has no connection to the antique, the wooden rod, or the chimes mentioned in the question. 4. Puzzle: Though some antique puzzles could have a wooden construction, there is no obvious connection between a puzzle and chimes. Chimes are not a common feature of puzzles, and thus, this answer does not align well with human common sense. 5. Old houses: While old houses could have antique items with wooden rods and chimes, the answer is too general and does not directly address the specific functionality of the object. The question is asking about the functional aspect of an object rather than the location or context it is found in. In conclusion, \\"old clock\\" is the answer that best aligns with human common sense due to the direct association with the given context and clues in the question. The antique with a wooden rod and chimes suggests an object with a function related to those attributes, and an old clock fits that description most accurately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You are presented with the quiz \\"What keeps penguins warm?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"feathers help birds fly and provide insulation\\" and \\"penguins rely on their feathers for insulation\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What keeps penguins warm?\\" is that penguins rely on their specialized feathers for insulation to stay warm in the extreme cold environments they inhabit. These unique feathers play a crucial role in helping penguins maintain their body temperature and stay comfortable amidst harsh conditions like strong winds, cold temperatures, and frigid waters. Penguin feathers are specifically adapted to provide exceptional insulation, which is essential for the birds to thrive in their environments. Penguin feathers are quite different from those of most birds. They are short, dense, and posses a unique structure that makes them highly effective for retaining warmth. A penguin's feathers are closely packed together, and they interlock to create a thick and insulating layer that helps trap warm air close to the bird's body. This trapped air acts as a barrier against the cold and minimizes heat loss. In addition to this dense feather layer, penguins also possess a layer of downy feathers close to their skin. The downy feathers are soft and fluffy, providing another layer of insulation that prevents the cold from reaching the penguin's skin and maintains the heat generated by their bodies. Another essential aspect of penguin feathers is that they are highly waterproof. This characteristic is vital for penguins, as they spend a significant amount of time in the icy waters hunting for food. The waterproofing is achieved through the presence of special oils that penguins preen onto their feathers from a gland near the base of their tail. This helps to ensure that their feathers remain dry and continue to insulate even when they are submerged in cold waters. Moreover, penguins have the ability to control the depth of their insulation by adjusting the position of their feathers in response to the surrounding temperature. This is called piloerection, and it helps them maintain a steady body temperature by either trapping more air for additional insulation when it's colder or releasing some of the trapped air to cool down when it's warmer. In summary, the best answer to the question \\"What keeps penguins warm?\\" is that penguins rely heavily on their specialized feathers to provide insulation in their freezing environments. These feathers, combined with the bird's ability to adjust the depth of insulation, allow them to maintain their body temperature and thrive in extreme cold conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Lib Dem minister has called for a rethink of plans to provide government guarantees for low-deposit mortgages beginning in January. He said there were already signs of \\"serious housing inflationary pressures\\" in parts of the country. But Downing Street said the plan would remove \\"obstacles\\" to aspiring buyers. The Help to Buy Scheme, announced in March's Budget, is designed to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder and enable existing homeowners to \\"trade up\\" to larger properties by giving banks greater confidence to lend. Under the second phase of the scheme, the government will guarantee a proportion of the loan for purchases of up to Â£600,000 for those able to put down a deposit of between 5% and 20%. The assistance, championed by Chancellor George Osborne, will be available for three years. Some economists have questioned whether such a major government intervention in the mortgage market - on top of existing equity loans for first-time buyers - is justified, saying it may lead to an unsustainable increase in prices. Recent indicators have suggested that prices are already increasing at their fastest rate for almost seven years - boosted by competitive mortgage rates and continuing imbalances of supply and demand. Mr Cable told Sky News that ministers should \\"certainly think about how it [Help to Buy] should come into effect, indeed whether it should come into effect in the light of changing market conditions\\". \\"We don't want a new housing bubble,\\" he added. \\"In many parts of the country it clearly isn't a problem. If you are in Northern Ireland or Wales or indeed the East Midlands you would wonder what all this is about,\\" \\"But certainly in London and the South East, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures.\\" The chief executive of Barclays, Antony Jenkins, has said he is concerned about the potential for a \\"property-driven boom\\" and although the Bank of England is monitoring the state of the market carefully, \\"these things can be difficult to control\\". But No 10 said the scheme would go ahead as planned. \\"We are faced with a situation - because of the fall in availability of 90 to 95% loan-to-value mortgages - where many first-time buyers are faced with a real obstacle to making a home of their own,\\" a spokesman said. \\"It is important we address this issue.\\" In an upbeat speech on the economy earlier in the week, Mr Osborne said 95% mortgages were not \\"weapons of mass financial destruction\\" but legitimate products that enabled those who could not save enough for a larger deposit to buy a home. Mr Cable has suggested an \\"uncontrolled\\" rise in house prices is one of the risks to a sustainable long-term economic recovery but the Council of Mortgage Lenders has described the pace of housing activity - compared with pre-2007 boom levels - as \\"moderate\\". Speaking at a CBI conference at Warwick University on Wednesday, Mr Cable said there were clear signs the economy was beginning to pick up but the upturn would only be \\"meaningful\\" when business had the confidence to increase levels of investment. He also warned against complacency \\"generated by a few quarters of good economic data\\". The CBI's director general, John Cridland, said there was \\"gathering momentum\\" in the economy but more needed to be done to correct the \\"profound economic imbalances which built up during the boom years\\", including developing a \\"coherent\\" industrial strategy.","completion":"A Lib Dem minister has called for a reevaluation of plans to provide government guarantees for low-deposit mortgages starting in January due to signs of \\"serious housing inflationary pressures\\" in parts of the UK.

Write an article based on this summary: A railway that was dormant for 50 years has reopened after more than 200 community volunteers spent eight years restoring it.","completion":"Title: Reviving History: Community Volunteers Bring Dormant Railway Back to Life after 50 Years Introduction History has been brought back to life as a railway that remained dormant for 50 years is now up and running again, all thanks to the dedication and hard work of more than 200 community volunteers who spent eight long years restoring it. This remarkable example of community spirit demonstrates how collective efforts can contribute to a significant achievement that benefits the entire community. Step 1: The Beginning of the Restoration Project The journey of this historic railway's revival started eight years ago when a group of passionate volunteers recognized the potential of the disused railway. Upon seeing the sorry state of the railway, overgrown with vegetation and in disrepair, the volunteers felt that restoring it would not only preserve a piece of history but also provide numerous benefits to the community. Step 2: Gathering Support and Resources With the initial idea of restoring the railway in place, the group of volunteers set out to garner support from the local community. They organized meetings, events, and fundraisers to raise awareness about the project. Through persistent efforts, the group members succeeded in gathering the needed resources and increasing the number of volunteers willing to lend a hand, bringing the overall count to over 200. Step 3: Assessing Requirements and Formulating a Plan The next step involved assessing the restoration requirements of the railway. The volunteers conducted a thorough examination of the tracks, bridges, stations, and other infrastructure elements. This assessment helped them understand the extent of the work needed and formulate a comprehensive plan that highlighted the tasks required, their estimated time frames, and potential budgetary constraints. Step 4: The Restoration Process With the plan in hand, the volunteers set to work on the restoration process. This undertaking involved clearing away vegetation, repairing or replacing tracks, fixing bridges, renovating railway stations, and refitting electrical systems. The skillful work of the volunteers spanned many professions, including carpenters, electricians, and engineers. Over the course of eight years, the hardworking volunteers devoted their spare time to bring the railway back to life. Step 5: Testing and Formal Reopening Once the restoration work was complete, the railway underwent a series of safety tests to ensure its functionality and compliance with regulations. Upon successful completion of the tests, the long-dormant railway finally reopened for public use amidst great fanfare. The volunteers celebrated their remarkable achievement with the community, who were excited to witness a piece of history come back to life. Conclusion The revitalization of this long-dormant railway stands as a testament to the power of community spirit, dedication, and hard work. The collective efforts of more than 200 volunteers have transformed a neglected piece of history into a fully-functioning railway that now benefits the local community. This inspiring story serves as a reminder that, when united in a common cause, anything is possible."},{"prompt":"Question: Title: beautiful night under the stars/ceiling :) Review: the size of the star are great not to big not to small the adhesive stickers could've been better but will do they dont glow very long but if you use a black light they glow all night i have them in my room and when i watch movies with my girl or friends its great i turn off the lights and turn on the black light and the stars are beautiful its like being at a drive thru people are looking at the stars more then the movie try a black light it works :) Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of person whose ancestral home was denied to her through agnatic primogeniture? Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

Answer: After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"While the Balfour Declaration you mentioned refers to the development of the British Empire's relationship with its Dominions, it is important to note that the task refers to a separate Balfour Declaration. The Balfour Declaration in your question clashing refers to a public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a \\"national home for the Jewish people\\" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population. It was dated 2 November 1917. The declaration was contained in a letter from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. This declaration was significant because it represented one of the first instances in which a major world power supported Zionist goals. The reasons behind the issuance of the Balfour Declaration are multifarious and complex. Firstly, Britain’s primary motivation was rooted in its own strategic interests. During the First World War, Britain was in dire need of Jewish support - specifically American Jewish backing - to strengthen its efforts against Germany and its allies. By endorsing the Zionist cause, Britain hoped to secure this much-needed support. Secondly, many in the British government, including Balfour himself, were influenced by their Christian upbringing with its underlying Zionist tenets. There was a romanticized conception of bringing the Jewish people back to the biblical homeland. Finally, there were internal political calculations. At the time, Zionist ideals were popular among some sections of the British Liberal party, with which Balfour was affiliated. They believed that a Jewish state would help ensure that the area remained pro-British. The Balfour Declaration had far-reaching implications. It engendered substantial immigration of Jews to Palestine and is considered one of the main catalysts of the eventual establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Despite initiating a monumental shift for the Jewish diaspora, it simultaneously became a source of ongoing contention with the Arab population in Palestine, laying grounds for a century-long conflict in the region. The Balfour Declaration, therefore, holds a critical place in the annals of Middle East history. It has proved to be one of the most contentious and controversial documents in the recent history of the world, promising a homeland for one people at the expense of another already living there, hence contributing to a long, ongoing conflict that remains unresolved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ABC Familyâs âBunheadsâ Season Ends With No Word on Renewal âBunheadsâ stars Sutton Foster, center, who has made the transition to television lead. As the end of the television season approaches, and odds are laid on the survival of prominent shows like “Smash” and “The Good Wife,” a handful of us are asking: What about “Bunheads”? This bittersweet comedy from Amy Sherman-Palladino about life and dance in the California hills lost about 40 percent of its audience over the course of its first season, which ended Feb. 25, and ABC Family has not announced whether it will be renewed. For the one million people who watched the finale Sutton Foster and Bailey Buntain may forever be sitting on a bench, wondering if the boy Ms. Buntain’s character slept with will ever call her back. That would be unfortunate, because “Bunheads,” beyond being a charming and funny show, has the great merit of being unlike anything else on television at the moment. It doesn’t fit into any of the typical prime-time genres, though it has affinities with teenage comedy and family drama. It could also be grouped, very loosely, with the music show “Glee” and the theater show “Smash,” except that “Bunheads” gets at what performance really means in its characters’ lives rather than using it as a kind of artificial sweetener to stimulate the fantasies of the audience. The show isn’t sui generis; its predecessors include Ms. Sherman-Palladino’s “Gilmore Girls” and other category-resistant shows like “Northern Exposure” and “Picket Fences.” But as a serious, literate, hourlong comedy it will always be a rare breed. (And it is a comedy, in the classical sense, not a comic drama or, ugh, dramedy.) Ms. Sherman-Palladino’s hyperverbal, screwball style and amusingly neurotic characters seem to be drawn less from television history than from John Hughes, Woody Allen and Jane Austen. “Bunheads” started with an audaciously arbitrary plot twist. The sassy and cynical Las Vegas showgirl Michelle Simms (Ms. Foster), blind drunk after a pity date with a nerdy admirer, Hubbell (Alan Ruck), woke up married to him. (That wasn’t the twist.) After Michelle saw Hubbell’s idyllic but rustic hometown, named Paradise, and met his formidable mother, Fanny (Kelly Bishop), logic dictated that she would high-tail it back to Vegas. So Ms. Sherman-Palladino killed off Hubbell in the first episode, stranding Michelle in Paradise and saddling her with enough guilt and responsibility to make it mildly plausible when she stayed to help at Fanny’s dance studio. Hubbell’s death was a clever device but also, through the first two episodes, a downer. That might help explain why the audience started to slip away even as the show shifted into more of a high-comic gear, and the focus quickly moved from Michelle’s angst — 30-something former dance prodigy still yearning for the bright lights of Broadway — to her relationship with four precocious ballet students, the bunheads of the title, who function as her fan club, her younger selves and her comic chorus line. Another problem early on was Ms. Foster, who wasn’t immediately successful in the transition from Tony-winning Broadway musical star (“Thoroughly Modern Millie” and “Anything Goes”) to TV lead. She seemed to scale herself down too far, as if afraid of making Michelle a stereotypical wisecracking chorine, and made her an uncomfortable noodge. That was fixed. The character seemed to be tweaked to fit with Ms. Foster’s low-key style, and for most of the season “Bunheads” was in a groove. It hasn’t been extraordinary, perhaps, but it’s been unusually smart, stylish and well acted, with winning performances by Ms. Bishop (a “Gilmore Girls” alumna) and the bunheads (Ms. Buntain, Kaitlyn Jenkins, Julia Goldani Telles and the swanishly gawky Emma Dumont) as well as Stacey Oristano and another “Gilmore” alum, Liza Weil, as the hilariously mismatched Stone sisters. In a Sherman-Palladino trademark all the characters take turns being the adult, in a way that reflects the insecurities and fulfills the wishes of real life: the teenagers tend to be focused and mature, while the actual adults are more likely to be scattered and irresponsible. The bunheads take care of one another, though in a crunch it’s Michelle’s shoulder they prefer to cry on. The season finale was a representative episode, with some story lines that were just O.K. — a scene with Franny insisting on giving the bunheads a sex-ed lecture wasn’t as funny as you’d expect — and a 12-minute sequence that was as good as anything I’ve seen on TV this year. In it Michelle sneaked off to Los Angeles to audition for a Broadway-bound musical alongside hundreds of other hopefuls while a casting director dismissed them at a machine-gun pace: “Nope. Nope. Nope.” It felt sadly, hopelessly real, and it epitomized Ms. Sherman-Palladino and Ms. Foster’s ability to render the texture of the performer’s life. That also shows up, in a different style, in the dance numbers that satirize and celebrate the sort of amateur performances many of us have endured, while illuminating the characters’ emotions and aspirations. The kicker to Michelle’s audition (the show had already been cast) could be seen as a cop-out; if the central conflict is between her Broadway dreams and her attachment to Paradise, then she needs to be faced with a real choice. But I’d be happy to let that wait until Season 2.

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.

Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed by the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries. - Alfriston is a village and civil parish in the Sussex district of Wealden , England . The village lies in the valley of the River Cuckmere , about four miles ( 6 km ) north - east of Seaford and south of the main A27 trunk road and part of the large area of Polegate . The parish has a population of 769 ( 2001 census ) , increasing to 829 at the 2011 census . - Polegate is a town and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England, United Kingdom. It is located five miles (8 km) north of the seaside resort of Eastbourne, and is part of the greater area of that town. Although once a railway settlement, its importance as such has now waned with closures of routes. The parish of Polegate had a population of 8586 on the 2011 census of which 41.2% were aged 65 and over. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The River Cuckmere rises near Heathfield in East Sussex, England on the southern slopes of the Weald. The name of the river probably comes from an Old English word meaning \\"fast-flowing\\", since it descends over 100 m (328 ft) in its initial four miles (6.4 km). It flows into the English Channel, and has the only undeveloped river mouth on the Sussex coast. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The Weald is an area in South East England situated between the parallel chalk escarpments of the North and the South Downs. It crosses the counties of Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and Surrey. It has three separate parts: the sandstone \\"High Weald\\" in the centre; the clay \\"Low Weald\\" periphery; and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, Old English in origin, signifies \\"woodland.\\" The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names. - East Sussex is a county in South East England. It is bordered by the counties of Kent to the north and east, Surrey to the north west and West Sussex to the west, and to the south by the English Channel. - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government. - Wealden is a local government district in East Sussex, England: its name comes from the Weald, the remnant forest which was once unbroken and occupies much of the centre and north of this area.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: With another invention in use, viewers will be also able to watch TV while walking to the office, taking a bus or simply waiting in line for lunch. A Beijing-based company named Innofidei Inc. claims to have developed the first mobile TV chip for the market, which can change hundreds of thousands of mobiles into micro-TVs. With this chip, people can receive TV signals on their phones and watch programs without any time or space limitations.\\"As long as the handset terminal has a colored screen and a battery, our chip can turn it into a mobile TV,\\" said Meng Fei, director of Innofidei's business development department. The chip can be placed into a cell phone, a PDA, an MP4, a digital camera or even a laptop. He said that this, together with plans by China's state broadcaster, would ensure the 2008 Games lives up to its promise as a \\"People's Olympics\\". \\"Our chips are cheap so that cell phones with them will not be much different in price from regular phones,\\" Meng said. \\"CCTV will offer some free channels during the Games, so people can enjoy the Olympics for free.\\" SARFT is planning to build a regional test network in Beijing and hopes to start trials as soon as possible. The goal is to deploy CMMB on a national level by the first half of 2008. Innofidei is now busy selling their chips to cell phone makers so that the new generation of phones reaches the market in early 2008. \\"Our invention successfully combines the good points of the two best-selling consumer products in history--TV sets and cell phones, \\" said Meng. \\"In the near future, soccer fans won't be tearing their hair out because they are stuck in traffic and missing the chance to see their favorite team's play.\\" Local baseball fans, meanwhile, will be able to draw comfort from the knowledge that--both at the Olympics and afterwards--their teams will be playing on a field designed to help recycle water.

Question: Question: \\"Who is supposed by a religious scholar of the time to place themselves in the position of god?\\" Context: \\"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of Enlightenment and the various religious perspectives that emerged during this era, the religious scholar's statement seems to refer to individuals who deny the existence of a higher power or divine law and rely solely on their own judgment and reasoning. Such individuals are believed to place themselves in the position of god, as they dismiss any higher authority beyond their own understanding and will. During the Enlightenment, various perspectives competed for intellectual acceptance, such as skepticism, deism, vitalism, pantheism, and atheism. While few intellectuals were true atheists, many challenged the prevailing orthodox beliefs and championed alternative religious outlooks. Deism, for instance, focused on the belief in God as the Creator without reliance on the Bible or any other miraculous source, prioritizing personal reason as the guiding force for their beliefs. This idea was particularly appealing to many Enlightenment thinkers who emphasized reason and rationality. Some intellectuals, like Pierre Bayle, argued that atheists could still be moral individuals despite their lack of belief in a god who punishes evil. They believed that atheists could hold concepts of honor and contribute positively to society, going beyond their own self-interest. However, critics like Voltaire maintained that without the belief in a higher authority, the moral order of society would be compromised. Concerns about the impact of atheistic beliefs on societal stability stemmed from the fear that, without divine law or a Supreme Authority, there would be no guiding principles for behavior and morality. Locke, for example, argued that in the absence of a god or divine law, individuals \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.\\" Consequently, such individuals would have nothing to restrain their actions or guide their moral compass, thus leading to moral anarchy. In this light, the religious scholar's remark on individuals placing themselves in the position of god appears to address the potential consequences of rejecting divine authority and relying solely on one's own judgment. By doing so, they disregard any external moral standards or laws, and in effect, assume a god-like authority over their actions. This perspective raises concerns about the impact of such beliefs on society, with critics arguing that the absence of divine guidance might undermine the moral fabric of society and lead to chaos and instability. On the other hand, some argue that it is possible for such individuals to develop their own moral frameworks and contribute positively to society without appealing to higher powers. The debate surrounding these issues reflects the complex religious dynamics during the Enlightenment, with intellectuals challenging the influence of orthodox religious beliefs on society while also trying to understand the role of religion and morality in structuring social order."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. They were one of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s and became counterculture icons of the decade's social revolution, alongside artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. Their biggest hits--including \\"The Sound of Silence\\" (1964), \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" (1968), \\"The Boxer\\" (1969), and \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" (1970)--reached number one on singles charts worldwide. Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements, which resulted in their breakup in 1970. The duo's fourth studio album, Bookends, was recorded in fits and starts over various periods from late 1966 to early 1968. The duo were signed under an older contract that specified the label pay for sessions, and Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists. The record's brevity reflects its concise and perfectionist production. The team spent over 50 studio hours recording \\"Punky's Dilemma\\", for example, and re-recorded vocal parts, sometimes note by note, until they were satisfied. Garfunkel's songs and voice took a lead role on some of the songs, and the harmonies for which the duo was known gradually disappeared. For Simon, Bookends represented the end of the collaboration and became an early indicator of his intentions to go solo. Although the album had been planned long in advance, work did not begin in earnest until the late months of 1967. Prior to release, the band helped put together and performed at the Monterey Pop Festival, which signaled the beginning of the Summer of Love on the West Coast. \\"Fakin' It\\" was issued as a single that summer and found only modest success on AM radio; the duo were much more focused on the rising FM format, which played album cuts and treated their music with respect. In January 1968, the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special, Three for Tonight, performing ten songs largely culled from their third album. Bookends was released by Columbia Records in April 1968. In an historical context, this was just 24 hours before the assassination of civil rights movement activist Martin Luther King Jr., which spurred nationwide outrage and riots. The album debuted on the Billboard Top LPs in the issue dated April 27, 1968, climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non-consecutive weeks; it remained on the chart as a whole for 66 weeks. Bookends received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies left the warehouse, a fact it touted in magazine ads. The record became the duo's best-selling album to date: it fed off the buzz created by the release of The Graduate soundtrack album ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units. Davis had predicted this fact, and suggested raising the list price of Bookends by one dollar to 5.79, above the then standard retail price, to compensate for including a large poster included in vinyl copies. Simon instead scoffed and viewed it as charging a premium on \\"what was sure to be that year's best-selling Columbia album\\". According to biographer Marc Eliot, Davis was \\"offended by what he perceived as their lack of gratitude for what he believed was his role in turning them into superstars\\". Rather than implement Davis' price increase plan, Simon & Garfunkel signed a contract extension with Columbia that guaranteed them a higher royalty rate. The lead single \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" became, at the 1969 Grammy Awards the first rock and roll song to receive Record of the Year; it was also awarded Best Contemporary Pop Performance by a Duo or Group.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did they record any other albums in the studio?","completion":"From the provided text: \\"The duo's fourth studio album, Bookends, was recorded in fits and starts over various periods from late 1966 to early 1968.\\" This quote indicates that there were prior studio albums, as Bookends was their fourth studio album, implying that they have recorded at least three other studio albums before this one."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in Spanish and your task is to translate it into English.

Given the question: Process: - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no air in the lung happens, how will it affect air is cleared in the lung. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having no air in the lungs would have a direct effect on the process of air clearing within the lungs. The entire process of respiration is predicated upon the presence and exchange of air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) within the lungs. Let's examine this situation in greater detail. First, let's recap the normal process of respiration: 1. Inhalation: You inhale, which involves drawing air into your lungs. This is facilitated by the downward movement of the diaphragm and the expansion of the chest cavity. 2. Lung expansion and filling: As the diaphragm moves down, the lungs have more room to expand, and air fills the lungs. The inhaled air contains oxygen, which is necessary for survival. 3. Exhalation: After a short duration, you exhale, at which point the diaphragm moves back up and reduces the volume of your chest cavity. During this process, carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular respiration, is expelled from the lungs. 4. Repeating the process: The process starts over again as you continue to inhale and exhale. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis – the complete absence of air within the lungs. Under this circumstance, several consequences would arise, directly affecting the normal process of respiration and gas exchange within the body: 1. Difficulty in inhaling: With no air in the lungs, it might be challenging to draw air into them due to the vacuum effect generated by the emptiness. This could further lead to strain on the diaphragm and respiratory muscles as they work harder to overcome the vacuum pressure. 2. Disruption of gas exchange: The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the bloodstream. Oxygen is vital for cell function and overall survival, while carbon dioxide is a waste product that needs to be removed from the body. No air in the lungs would mean that the necessary gas exchange would not occur, leading to oxygen deprivation and an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body. 3. Potential damage to lung tissue: The absence of air in the lungs can also cause the delicate lung tissue to collapse, as the alveoli, which are tiny sacs responsible for gas exchange, rely on air to maintain their structure. Collapsed alveoli can lead to lung damage and decreased lung capacity, further impacting the efficiency of gas exchange. 4. Systemic effects: If the absence of air in the lungs persists, it can lead to a severe reduction in oxygen levels and a dangerous increase in carbon dioxide levels in the body, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, and eventually leading to unconsciousness and death, if not addressed. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis stating the absence of air in the lungs would have a direct effect on the process of air being cleared in the lungs as well as having systemic implications on the body's overall function. The normal process of respiration is critical for maintaining adequate oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body, and any disruption to this process may lead to detrimental health consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200 houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west. The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298 houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.

Question: \\"What partial definition was created by Nakdong?\\" Context: \\"By August, the KPA had pushed back the ROK Army and the Eighth United States Army to the vicinity of Pusan in southeast Korea. In their southward advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung that he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities. By September, the UN Command controlled the Pusan perimeter, enclosing about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The partial definition created by the Nakdong River refers to the natural boundary formed by the river, which contributed to the delimitation of the Pusan Perimeter during the Korean War. This geographical feature played a significant role in the defensive strategy of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army and the United Nations Command led by the Eighth United States Army during their stand against the advancing North Korean People's Army (KPA) in August and September 1950. The Pusan Perimeter was a defensive line that encompassed the southeastern region of the Korean Peninsula, where the ROK Army and the UN Command managed to maintain control over approximately 10% of Korea. This line was essential for the survival and eventual counterattack of the allied forces since Pusan, the area's main port city, served as a crucial logistics and supply hub during the conflict. The Nakdong River, a major river in South Korea, emerges as an important natural barrier in this context because it provided a defensible line for the ROK Army and the UN Command, protecting the Pusan Perimeter from the southward advance of the KPA. The river's presence allowed the defending forces to establish a strong frontline based on its geographical features, which included steep banks, tight bends, and limited crossing points. Despite the challenging conditions, the KPA repeatedly attempted to breach the Nakdong River line and break through into the Pusan Perimeter. These efforts led to several significant confrontations, such as the Battle of Taegu and the Battle of the Naktong Bulge, both of which resulted in the successful defense by the ROK Army and UN Command and the subsequent failure of the KPA's offensives. In conclusion, the partial definition created by the Nakdong River refers to its role in shaping the Pusan Perimeter and providing a vital natural defensive barrier for the ROK Army and the UN Command during their battle against the KPA in the early stages of the Korean War. This natural boundary significantly influenced the strategic planning and defensive measures adopted by the allied forces and served as a contributing factor in their eventual ability to halt the KPA's southward advance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Now, I have a new situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Answer this question please: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania?

There are several factors that contribute to this difference, including the types of plant species present, the role of fires in grassland ecosystems, and the overall soil composition. In grassland ecosystems, like those found in Kenya, the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses play a crucial role in adding organic matter to the soil. These roots grow extensively both vertically and laterally, creating a dense network that holds the soil together and helps to prevent erosion. As the roots die and decompose, they contribute large amounts of organic matter to the soil, resulting in the development of a thick A horizon with a deep distribution of organic matter. In addition, fires are a frequent occurrence in grassland ecosystems, and although they may destroy aboveground plant material, they also stimulate increased contributions from roots. This is because the fires remove the aboveground biomass, freeing up space and nutrients which then encourages root growth. The ash from the burned vegetation also adds nutrients to the soil, further promoting root growth and soil development. By contrast, in the Tanzanian forests, tree leaves falling on the forest floor serve as the primary source of soil organic matter. Although the roots of trees also contribute to soil organic matter, this contribution is generally less significant than that of grass roots in grassland ecosystems. The soil in forests is characterized by a more layered structure, with most of the organic matter stored in the forest floor (O horizon) and a thinner A horizon. Moreover, the acidity in forest soils inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that would otherwise mix surface litter into the mineral soil, resulting in a thinner incorporation of organic matter in the A horizon of forest soils compared to grassland soils. In conclusion, plant roots play a greater role in soil development in the Kenyan grasslands due to the extensive root systems of grasses, their adaptation to the natural fire regime, and the deeper distribution of organic matter in grassland soils. The Tanzanian forests, while also contributing through root systems, rely more heavily on the accumulation of leaf litter on the forest floor for organic matter input and have a typically thinner A horizon and higher soil acidity which influences root growth and the activities of soil organisms."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village had a volcano about to erupt next to them? Hint: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Green village experienced an increase in both the size and number of daily earthquakes. This increase suggests that the magma is pushing upward into the magma chamber, causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up.

The body of Titus Tackett was found inside of a minivan about 11am this morning. The minivan was parked outside of a home off Highway 72, the body was found by a resident. Tackett disappeared between about midnight and 1:15am on Wednesday morning from a home near Lake Killarney in the Killarney Shores area. That\`s about four miles southeast of Ironton. A massive search started after Titus\` family discovered he had disappeared and called authorities. Titus' aunt tells FOX 2 that Titus lived in Potosi with his mother and her parents. His mom brought him to his dad\`s home Tuesday night to visit his father and his sister. Titus\` father lives in Killarney Shores with his father and his daughter. At about midnight Titus\` mom and dad went into Ironton and left Titus with his grandfather at the home. When they got back about 1:15am this morning, they noticed the door to the home was open and Titus was gone. That was when the search started. Law officers from the Iron County Sheriff\`s Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol and the FBI searched all night into this morning. They searched by air and on the ground. K-9 searchers were also brought in. Volunteers showed up as well- they walked the area and rode ATV\`s. That search went on until the tragic discovery was made inside the minivan. At this point, authorities say it's unclear if foul play is involved or if Titus' death was somehow a tragic accident. An autopsy will help reveal clues into how the three year old died. His says Titus was adventurous and his parents had caught him trying to get of the house in the past.

Lee was a kind-hearted girl who always loved helping others and had a zest for learning new things. One evening, Lee came across a documentary on her town's local history showcasing their beautiful park and its lush green gardens. She was intrigued to discover that the park was actually established by the town's founding fathers, who wanted to promote relaxation and clean air for its residents. The park had been well kept for generations and had become a symbol of the town's pride. The following weekend, Lee and her mom visited the park, marveling at the vibrant flowers, tall trees, and happy people enjoying their leisure time with friends and family. Lee couldn't help but notice an elderly woman sitting alone on a bench, her eyes glazed over as if she was lost in deep thought. Sensing that the woman might be feeling lonely, Lee decided to approach her. \\"Excuse me, ma'am, would you like some company?\\" Lee asked gently. The woman looked up and a smile slowly formed on her face. \\"Why, yes, young lady. Please, sit down and join me.\\" As they talked, Lee discovered that the woman, Mrs. Thompson, was a descendant of one of the town's founding fathers. Unfortunately, Mrs. Thompson had no family left and had begun to feel a sense of sadness and loneliness despite the park's beautiful surroundings. Feeling her heart go out to the kind but lonely woman, Lee decided that she would do something special to make Mrs. Thompson feel more connected to the town and its people. Over the next few weeks, Lee did extensive research on the town's history and gathered several interesting stories interwoven with Mrs. Thompson's ancestors. One sunny day, she invited Mrs. Thompson to a picnic she had organized in the park. To Mrs. Thompson's surprise, the park was filled with families all having picnics, everyone chatting and enjoying the lovely day. It was as if the park had returned to its original purpose of fostering a sense of community and togetherness. With Mrs. Thompson in the center of it all, Lee began to tell the stories she had uncovered about the town's founding fathers. Each story resonated deeply with the townspeople, and the atmosphere grew vibrant and warm. Mrs. Thompson's eyes twinkled as she listened, grateful for Lee's efforts to bring connection and life back to the park. As the day came to an end and the families said their goodbyes, Mrs. Thompson hugged Lee tightly. \\"Thank you, dear. You've made this park, and my heart, feel alive again.\\" Returning home, Lee's mom couldn't help but gaze at her little girl with admiration and love. \\"Today, you did something truly special, sweetheart,\\" she said, with tears welling up in her eyes.

It is evident that they had devoted a significant amount of time to this operation, however, there is no information given about the duration of the chase once the thief was spotted. The actions during the specific event of the thief being spotted and subsequently caught are described in relatively brief terms, 'they saw the thief', followed immediately by 'all the police officers rushed to grab the guy and they caught him.' There is no explicit mention of the time it took from the moment they saw the thief to the moment they apprehended him. Without this specific information, it would be impossible to confirm whether it took them 20 minutes to apprehend the thief during that particular incident. Hypothetically, the capture could have been instantaneous, without any chase at all, or it could have spanned a much longer period than the suggested 20 minutes. To be able to confidently conclude the duration of the capture, we would need additional information describing the event in more detail. For instance, it would be pertinent to know whether there was a chase, if so, how long it lasted, how far they had to run, or if there were other factors that could have prolonged the period before the thief was finally apprehended. Lacking such specifics, any assertion about the time taken for the actual capture would be conjectural at best.

Judge denies request to delay Boston Marathon bombing trial due to Paris attacks The judge overseeing the Boston Marathon bombing trial on Wednesday denied a request from the alleged bomber’s attorneys to delay the trial due to the recent attacks in France. Lawyers for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev had asked the judge to delay jury selection due to the violence in France, which has dominated the news over the last week and drawn comparisons to what unfolded in Boston two years ago. The shooting massacre at the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper in Paris, was followed by a massive manhunt for two brothers who authorities said had become radicalized; days of bloodshed and panic culminated in a shootout with police. News reports and commentators have repeatedly pointed to how this mirrored much of what happened when the Boston Marathon was bombed, an attack that killed three people and injured more than 260 others in April 2013. Within days, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, were the subjects of a manhunt that reverberated across a major metropolitan area; the brothers, who law enforcement officials said had become radicalized, engaged in a shootout with police before Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed and his younger brother eventually taken into custody. Attorneys for Tsnarnaev argued that while the massive pool of jurors was instructed to avoid news about the Boston Marathon bombing trial, they were not told to avoid news from France, which meant they could have been exposed to the reports tying the two situations together. District Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. rejected the request Wednesday, saying that the detailed questionnaires filled out by potential jurors confirmed his judgment that a fair and impartial jury could be found: This is the latest time O’Toole has rejected requests from Tsarnaev’s attorneys arguing that the trial be postponed. He has done so at least twice and has also denied requests that the trial be moved to a different location, determining that a fair jury could be found. O’Toole, a Massachusetts native who was appointed in 1995, is said to have a calm, collected temperament. “He has that unique way of detaching himself, to be absolutely objective, which I think is a great skill,” Jim McIntyre, who recruited O’Toole to Boston College, told the Boston Globe last month. While he has repeatedly turned down requests to delay or move the trial, he has also suggested that he is keeping an open mind and said he would revisit these issues based on what happens during jury selection. Jury selection in the high-profile trial began last week. Tsarnaev faces 30 charges for the attack and for shooting and killing Sean Collier, an MIT campus police officer, in the days after the bombing. About 1,200 potential jurors are being considered for the trial, which is expected to begin on Jan. 26 and could last for up to four months. The jury pool is so large because of the nature of this case. In addition to finding jurors in the region who can be deemed impartial, there needs to be 18 potential jurors — a dozen to sit on the jury and six alternates — who are willing to give Tsarnaev the death penalty. The Justice Department is seeking the death penalty in this case, which makes for an unusual situation in Massachusetts, a state that abolished the death penalty in 1984. A Boston Globe poll conducted five months after the bombing showed that 57 percent of people in Massachusetts wanted Tsarnaev to serve a life sentence, compared to 33 percent who wanted the death penalty.

Article: The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone. For more information: www.wfp.ofp/purchase-progress.

Let's break down these factors and analyze how discovering oil in countries other than the Middle East might affect them. 1. Supply and demand: The main reason that oil prices fluctuate is due to supply and demand. If more oil is discovered in countries outside of the Middle East, global oil supply would increase. This could lead to a temporary decrease in oil prices. However, considering the current trend towards more eco-friendly and sustainable means of transportation, the demand for petrol might continue to decrease despite temporary changes in oil prices. 2. International relations and geopolitics: Dependence on oil imports from the Middle East has historically led to tense geopolitical relationships between oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. If oil reserves are discovered in other regions, international relations might become more stable, as nations would have more diverse sources of oil imports. This could reduce the risk of conflicts and economic turbulence caused by issues related to the oil market. However, it is also essential to note that tensions around oil production might shift to new regions where the reserves have been discovered. 3. Technological advancements and alternative energy sources: The world today is moving towards adopting greener, more sustainable, and renewable sources of energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular, affordable, and accessible due to advances in battery technology and increasing charging infrastructure. Most major automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in the development of electric and hybrid vehicles, accelerating the transition away from petrol-run cars. This shift is likely to continue, even if oil is found in regions other than the Middle East. 4. Environmental concerns and government policies: There is a growing global awareness about the impact of fossil fuel consumption on the environment and climate change. Many governments across the world are implementing policies and incentives to encourage the use of cleaner and more sustainable modes of transportation. These initiatives are expected to continue and strengthen in the coming years, thus leading to reduced reliance on petrol-run cars, regardless of the location of oil reserves. In conclusion, discovering oil in countries other than the Middle East might have short-term effects on oil prices and international relations, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the ongoing transition towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly modes of transportation. Therefore, there will likely be fewer petrol-run cars in the long run, regardless of the new oil reserves location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a hypothesis: Journalism addresses matters of public importance, and this should be recognized. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the premise, if true, supports the hypothesis, it is essential to analyze them independently and identify any direct or indirect correlations. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The premise suggests that the moral takeaway might be recognizing the need for more humility when considering the usefulness of journalism in addressing matters of public importance. Essentially, it implies that journalists or the public should not overstate journalism's benefits in tackling significant public issues. Hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that journalism does address matters of public importance, and this role should be acknowledged by society or the journalism industry. First, both the premise and hypothesis acknowledge that journalism has a role in addressing matters of public importance. The difference between the two statements lies in their approach to recognizing this role. The premise suggests that there should be greater humility in acknowledging journalism's usefulness, while the hypothesis asserts that journalism's role should be openly recognized. Now, let's analyze if the premise's truth leads to the hypothesis being true. If we accept the premise that there should be more humility about the usefulness of journalism, it still implies its usefulness and admits that journalism plays a role in addressing public issues. The element of humility does not negate the fact that journalism has a role; it merely cautions against overstating or overestimating that role. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then it indirectly supports the hypothesis, as acknowledging the necessity for humility in understanding journalism's usefulness still implies that journalism does have a role in addressing matters of public importance. However, it's important to understand that the premise calls for a more nuanced and humble approach to acknowledging journalism's value, while the hypothesis enables a more direct and open recognition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This will loosen up the grime and brake dust that has collected on the wheel, prepping the wheels for treatment. If you have a pressure washer, use this to provide a stronger stream of water. Some examples of aluminum wheel cleaner are P21S Gel Wheel Cleaner and SONAX Wheel Cleaner, but any non-acidic, aluminum wheel cleaner will do. Spray the cleaner over the surface of the wheels, inside of the spokes, and around the lug nuts. You can find aluminum wheel cleaners at a mechanic shop, a superstore (for example, Walmart) or online on Amazon. If you want to make your own aluminum wheel cleaner at home, you can try combining lemon juice and soda and using this as a cleaner. You can also wash the wheel with dawn detergent and water, and then sprinkle on baking soda to scrub. In both of these cases there is an abrasive material (soda or baking soda) which serves to scrub off grime. Scrub the surface of the wheel, inside the spokes and around the lug nuts. You may need special, wheel-specific brushes or a toothbrush to get into hard to reach areas. If the wheel starts to dry, add more water to it as you scrub. Scrubbing a dry wheel might scratch the finish. To reach in and scrub inside the spokes, use a cone brush. To get around the lug nuts, use a lug nut brush. Both kinds of brushes should be available at mechanic shops. A soft-bristled brush will prevent you from scratching the finish on the wheel. The wheel wells are a prime spot for caked in dirt and grime. Use a stiffer brush in this area, as a soft bristled brush probably won’t do the trick. A long-handled brush can be helpful for reaching into the well. A soft-bristled brush is a bad fit for the wheel wells. You need soft bristles on the wheel surfaces and stiff bristles on the wheel wells. Now that you’ve scrubbed away dirt and dust, use the hose to rinse the entirety of the wheel, directing water into the spokes, up to the wheel well, and in the lug nut holes. Let the wheel sit for a few minutes to dry, and use a clean rag to lightly remove residual dust.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Suspect in Northridge shootings arrested in Las Vegas, police say Los Angeles Police Department detectives have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting deaths of four people in Northridge outside an unlicensed boarding home, department officials confirmed. Few details were released about the circumstances of the arrest, which took place without incident overnight in Las Vegas, according to several sources familiar with the case. A news conference is planned for later Tuesday. Police would not immediately identify the suspect, citing the ongoing investigation, but said he was involved in the shooting early Sunday in the 17400 block of Devonshire Street. PHOTOS: Four killed in shooting at Northridge home Sources said the shooting may have been prompted by a personal dispute, but did not elaborate. Officers responded to a home about 4:25 a.m. Sunday after a 911 caller reported yelling and shots fired, police said. Authorities found four people — two men and two women — shot dead outside. No weapon was recovered at the home, prompting police to rule out a murder-suicide. Three of the victims — a man and two women — were shot on the walkway on the left side of the home, a source familiar with the case told The Times on Monday. They were all wearing hooded sweat shirts and were about two feet apart from one another. All three had at least one bullet wound to the head. One victim was crumpled on her knees, the source said, her face buried in the palms of her hands, \\"almost like she was praying.\\" The other two victims on the walkway were face down. The fourth victim — a man — was farther away and appeared as if he was trying to run to the backyard when he was shot. He had at least one gunshot wound, according to the source. \\"It looked like a quick kill,\\" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. The names of the victims have not been released. Police said the women were in their mid-20s; one man was in his mid-30s and the other man in his late 40s. Authorities said the home was an illegal boardinghouse, with up to 17 people living in conditions that Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander described as \\"deplorable.\\" The home had so much debris and so many partitions that one room could be accessed only through a window, he said. A trail of extension cords led investigators to the backyard, where several makeshift living quarters had been assembled. The owner of the home, Yag Kapil, said he rented out rooms but denied he was running a boardinghouse. Kapil, 78, who lives at the home, said he is bedridden and was sleeping at the time of the shootings. He said he didn't hear anything and didn't know the victims. The slayings stunned the quiet Northridge street, which residents said was the kind where neighbors knew each other and walked to the grocery store or synagogue nearby. \\"It's usually sleepy-time America,\\" said Richard Rutherford, 58, who was awakened by the gunfire. The violent crime rate for Northridge falls in the middle of all Los Angeles neighborhoods, but homicide is rare in the community, according to LAPD data analyzed in The Times' Crime L.A. database. In the previous six months, Northridge had one homicide out of the 89 violent crimes reported. Since 2007, and before Sunday's quadruple homicide, Northridge had 11 homicides, 10 of them south of Nordhoff Street. The location of Sunday's slayings is on the border with Granada Hills, which typically has a much lower violent-crime rate than Northridge.

They come to understand that each element embodies a vital aspect of harmony. By uniting their unique talents, they can wield the Magic Property to its fullest potential and restore balance to the world. While Lord Volthrax strengthens his hold on the land, Alexia and her friends delve deeper into the lore and secrets of the Magic Property. As they uncover the source of Magic Property - the mythical Sixth Element - Alexia must grapple with her destiny and her ever-growing understanding of the enormity of the long-held secret. Ultimately, they learn that only by embracing the Sixth Element and its infinite potential can they unlock their true powers and combat the impending darkness. In the climactic battle, Alexia's newfound understanding of the Magic Property propels her and her friends to confront Lord Volthrax. Embracing their elemental powers and trust in each other, they use the Elemental Artifacts and Magic Property to overwhelm and defeat Lord Volthrax and his minions, restoring balance to Elytheria and ushering in a new era of magic property empowerment. The Five Elements of Magic Property is a tale of adventure and self-discovery, weaving in themes of friendship, courage, and sacrifice, as it explores the true meaning and depth of power, responsibility, and the untapped potential of the mystical elements that bind our world together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jay and Bella loved fish tanks. They had everything they needed for a new tank except for some plants. They set the tank up and ordered some plants from a web site. It took 2 weeks for the plants to arrive.","completion":"When the plants finally arrived, Jay and Bella eagerly opened the package, excited to add the final touch to their fish tank. The first step was to carefully inspect the plants for any sign of damage or disease, as they wanted to ensure that the aquatic environment they were creating was healthy for their fish. Satisfied with the condition of the plants, Jay and Bella decided to give them a gentle rinse under cool, running water. They did this to remove any dirt or debris that could potentially harm the water quality in their fish tank. Next, Jay and Bella prepared the fish tank for the addition of the plants. They turned off the aquarium light and any pumps or filters connected to the tank to ensure a calm and safe installation process. They also lowered the water level slightly to make it easier to place the plants in the substrate without making a mess. With the fish tank prepped, Jay and Bella began the process of adding the plants. They carefully chose the ideal location for each plant based on its lighting and space requirements for optimal growth. They used a fine-tipped pair of aquascaping tweezers to help them place the plants in the substrate, pushing them in far enough to secure them without damaging the roots. Once all the plants were securely in place, Jay and Bella gently added more water to the tank, filling it back up to the appropriate level. They turned on the aquarium light and pumped in some liquid fertilizer to give the plants an initial boost of nutrients. Since the plants would take some time to acclimate to their new environment, Jay and Bella decided to wait a few days before introducing fish into the tank. This would give the plants a chance to settle and start absorbing nutrients, making the environment more stable and suitable for the fish. During this time, they monitored the water parameters using a test kit to ensure that the plants were effectively cycling the water. Once the water parameters were stable and suitable for fish, Jay and Bella selected a variety of colorful and vibrant fish species to add to their new, lush aquatic environment. As the days turned into weeks, Jay and Bella marveled at the beauty of the thriving aquatic ecosystem they had created. The plants flourished and provided a serene haven for the fish as they swam gracefully around the tank. The fish tank became a symbol of Jay and Bella's dedication to their shared passion and love for the underwater world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking.

It was only natural that the two friends would turn to each other for help in navigating their shared interest in literature. The long book Craig had picked up was a highly anticipated new release, generating a buzz around town and igniting the curiosity of both voracious readers and casual book lovers alike. The story revolved around a fantastical world filled with marvelous creatures, mythical beings, and thrilling adventures. The due date for the book was fast approaching, but Jason had yet to crack open its cover. Knowing that his friend would miss the opportunity to immerse himself in the wonderful world the book had to offer if left to his own devices, Craig decided to step in and help. The two friends spent days together, nestled in the cozy nook of Craig's living room, as Craig patiently and engagingly read the adventure to Jason. They laughed together at the humorous parts, gasped in shock at unexpected twists, and occasionally paused to mull over a particularly profound phrase or idea. The outside world seemed to vanish entirely as they lost themselves in the magical, captivating realm brought to life by the book. Jason, ears attentively catching every word, felt profoundly grateful for his friend's help. Reading the long book was a challenge he had been reluctant to face alone, but with Craig to steer him through the labyrinth of prose, he could deeply appreciate the narrative. The journey that the dynamic duo embarked upon seemed no less powerful, real, and transformational than that experienced by the characters themselves. As Craig neared the end of the final chapter, anticipation hung heavy in the air. Each word carefully articulated, every sentence filled with emotion, it felt as though all the loose ends of the story were gradually being woven together. When Craig at last finished reading, a heavy silence permeated the room, the weight of the story's conclusion resting upon both friends. Their minds were filled to the brim with vivid imagery, heart-stopping action sequences, profound wisdom, and emotional connection to the characters.

The long book stirred something within them, igniting a fire of passion for literature that they had previously only sensed on an individual level. Jason's newfound appreciation for understanding complex narratives, characters, and subtexts drove him to confront his reading difficulties and become increasingly committed to improving his fluency.

Plot title: The Man in the Iron Mask Movie plot: In 1638, King Louis XIII of France is delighted when his wife bears him a son, Louis, the heir to the throne. However, a few minutes later, a second son is born. Colbert (Walter Kingsford), the king's trusted adviser, persuades the king to secretly send the second child, Philippe, away to Gascony to be raised by his majesty's dear friend, d'Artagnan (Warren William), in order to avert a possible civil war later. Fouquet (Joseph Schildkraut), a mere cardinal's messenger at the time, finds out about the twin and uses this to advance his career. Twenty years later, he is the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. The king is hated by the commoners for levying oppressive taxes and for executioning them for not paying them. Fouquet sends soldiers to force d'Artagnan and his people to pay the taxes, though the old king had exempted him and his village from them. They are driven off, but return in much greater numbers and, with great difficulty, capture d'Artagnan, the three musketeers and Philippe. Louis is about to order their executions when Colbert tells him about Philippe's uncanny resemblance to him. As Louis is aware of an assassination attempt to take place that day (but not where or when), he makes Philippe impersonate him in exchange for his friends' lives. Philippe not only survives the ambush, he shows mercy to his would-be killers and is cheered by the people. Princess Maria Theresa (Joan Bennett), whom Louis is to wed to seal an alliance with Spain, finds this new Louis much more attractive than the real one. However, when she discovers that Louis is having an affair with Mademoiselle de la Valliere (Marion Martin), she returns to Spain. When the truth is discovered, Louis has Philippe imprisoned with an iron mask placed on his head, hoping that Philippe's beard will grow inside the mask and eventually suffocate him. Philippe is rescued by the musketeers, who break into the sleeping Louis's chamber and imprison him in the mask. The musketeers drag him away and lock him in the Bastille, where the jailers...

One is the Northern Stonemans: abolitionist U.S. Representative Austin Stoneman (based on the Reconstruction-era Representative Thaddeus Stevens[14][15]), his two sons, and his daughter Elsie. The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their two daughters, and three sons. The Stoneman brothers visit the Cameron estate in South Carolina, representing the Old South. Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, while young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War begins, these young men enlist in their respective armies. Black militiamen under a white leader ransack the Cameron house; the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout the militia. Meanwhile, the younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the Siege of Petersburg, earning the nickname of \\"the Little Colonel\\". But he is also wounded and captured, and is taken to a Union hospital in Washington, D.C. There he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. While recovering, Cameron is told that he will be hanged for being a Confederate guerrilla. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see Abraham Lincoln, and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theater, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and his fellow Radical Republicans are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the Reconstruction era.[16] Part 2: Reconstruction[edit] Stoneman and his protÃ©gÃ© Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic characteristics,[17] travel to South Carolina to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand.

How to recognize hives (rash )<br>Detect itchy or stinging skin spots. Hives may begin as an itchy or stinging area on your skin. If you begin to notice itching, stinging or pain on any parts of your skin with or without a specific cause, it may be hives and you could develop welts. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hives can kill.","completion":"Hives, also known as urticaria, are a common skin condition characterized by the appearance of raised, red, itchy welts on the skin. They are often caused by an allergic reaction to something, but can also develop in response to infection, stress, or physical stimuli such as heat or cold. While hives can be unpleasant and uncomfortable, they are generally not life-threatening. However, in some cases, they may be indicative of a more serious underlying medical condition that requires attention. So, while it is incorrect to draw the conclusion that \\"hives can kill,\\" it is important to be aware of the potential complications and seek appropriate medical care when necessary. To recognize hives, follow these steps: 1. Inspect your skin for raised welts or bumps: Hives often present as raised, red, or pale-colored welts that appear suddenly on the skin. These welts may vary in size, shape, and location, and can occur individually or merge to form larger areas. 2. Check for itching or stinging: Hives are typically accompanied by itching, stinging, or a burning sensation. If you are experiencing these sensations, particularly in conjunction with the appearance of welts, you may have hives. 3. Monitor for changes: Hives can appear and disappear quickly, often within a few hours. If you notice the welts on your skin are changing in size, shape, or location, you may be dealing with hives. 4. Observe the duration of symptoms: Hives usually last for a short period, often less than 24 hours. However, there are instances where hives can last longer, even up to six weeks (known as chronic urticaria). If your symptoms persist, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management. 5. Pay attention to potential triggers: Identifying possible triggers, such as specific foods, medications, or environmental factors, may aid in determining whether the symptoms are hives. Document any new exposures, dietary changes, or other situations that could possibly be linked to your hives to help with diagnosis and treatment. Though hives themselves are typically not life-threatening, it is crucial to consider the possibility of a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction that can be potentially fatal and requires immediate medical attention. Signs and symptoms may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, rapid or weak pulse, nausea, vomiting, and a sudden drop in blood pressure. If you suspect you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylactic symptoms along with hives, seek emergency medical care right away. In conclusion, while hives are generally not life-threatening, they can sometimes indicate a more severe underlying issue, such as anaphylaxis or an underlying medical condition. It is essential to monitor your symptoms, recognize potential triggers, and consult your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment when necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it's true that the premise involves a group of people practicing in a field, there's no explicit reference to the game of soccer or any activities typically associated with it. Instead, it's mentioned that a man is performing a \\"high kick in the air\\", which might hint at some form of martial art practice, but it could also be interpreted in numerous other ways. Moreover, the woman in the black tank top watching the man adds another layer of ambiguity. She could be a trainer, an observer, a participant taking a rest, or just someone casually watching. Again, there’s no clear link to soccer. In order to confirm the hypothesis that they are playing a soccer game, there would need to be additional contextual clues referencing elements of the game itself.

We might also look for specific actions that are unique to soccer, such as dribbling the ball, scoring goals, or defending.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did Slavicisation do?\\" Context: \\"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"\\"Slavicisation\\" refers to the cultural, linguistic, and social process of adopting or borrowing Slavic culture, language, and norms, typically by non-Slavic societies. In the context you have provided, Slavicisation was a key contributor to the absorption and assimilation of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans in Eastern Europe (modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans) by the Proto-Slavic population of the region approximately by the 6th century AD. This process ultimately led to the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages in the region. This process of Slavicisation was typically not a rapid process, but extended over several centuries during which the original language and culture of the absorbed societies progressively disappeared or evolved, and the cultures, languages, and identities of the incoming Slavic peoples increasingly became dominant. Therefore, Slavicisation contributed to the major linguistic and cultural shifts observed in Eastern Europe and was instrumental in shaping the region's modern day linguistic and cultural landscape."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Premise: \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\"?","completion":"To analyze the entailment of the hypothesis \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\" based on the premise \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" it is essential to begin by defining the terminology and understanding the logical structure of the statements. Entailment is a logical relation between two statements where the truth of one statement necessitates the truth of the other. In other words, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. In the premise, \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" the key terms can be broken down as follows: - \\"Horrible-looking\\": A term used to describe something that has an unpleasant or repulsive appearance. - \\"Things\\": A general term that can refer to any object, entity, or being. In this context, it implies that the speaker is referring to various items or beings that share the described attribute (horrible-looking). In the hypothesis, \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\" the terminology can be broken down similarly. Here are the definitions of the key terms in the hypothesis: - \\"Horrible-looking\\": As before, this term is used to describe something with an unpleasant or repulsive appearance. - \\"Beasts\\": A term for non-human animals, typically large and wild ones, often with a negative connotation and implying that they are frightening, dangerous, or unpleasant in appearance. Now let's analyze the entailment. The premise states that the things under discussion are horrible-looking, and the hypothesis is inquiring if these horrible-looking entities are indeed beasts. Thus, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise, as the truth of one statement does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the other statement. This is because the word \\"things\\" in the premise is more general and can encompass a broader range of objects or entities. While the word \\"beasts\\" used in the hypothesis is a subset of \\"things,\\" they represent a specific category of creatures (non-human animals, especially the massive and wild ones). There could be other entities (such as human-built structures, objects, plants, or phenomenon) that fit the description of horrible-looking but are not beasts. For example, if someone said, \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" while pointing at a collection of misshapen statues, this premise could be true. However, it does not entail that they must be \\"horrible looking beasts,\\" as they could instead be inanimate objects or entirely human creations.

Jerika Bolen, an Appleton, Wisconsin, resident who has spinal muscular atrophy type 2, plans to turn off her nighttime breathing assistance at the end of August with the full support of her mother Jen. “There were a lot of tears, but then I realized I’m going to be in a better place, and I’m not going to be in this terrible pain. I’ve been working on it and thinking about it for way longer than anyone else has,” Bolen told Appleton’s Post-Crescent News. Many adults with SMA are saddened by her decision and disturbed her mother and the media aren’t questioning it. “She’s not sick, she’s not terminal, she’s just in pain. Get her some help, but don’t let her die,” says Emily Wolinsky, president of NMD United, an organization by and for people living with neuromuscular diseases such as SMA. She is also the creator of Dear Julianna, a campaign in which adults with neuromuscular diseases wrote life-affirming letters to a 5-year-old child with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a type of NMD, whose mother allowed her to die when she said she “wanted to go to heaven” instead of the hospital. Much of the media coverage makes a point of saying most don’t survive SMA past adolescence, but there are many examples of adults with SMA who have pain, but lead rewarding lives. “I use a ventilator most of the day, a wheelchair, and a lot of services and my life (even with pain) is pretty fantastic,” says Alice Wong, 42, founder of the Disability Visibility Project, who has the same diagnosis as Jerika. Most with SMA have had surgeries, especially in their teens, but many wonder why the media hasn’t investigated Bolen’s 38 surgeries claim. “Thirty-eight surgeries in 14 years is a lot,” says Wolinsky. Polling her friends, she found the most they’d had was two before age 18. “Maybe it’s the surgeries, not the diagnosis that’s exacerbating her pain.” Still, there’s a lot of variability in lived experience, shouldn’t Bolen have the right to decide her fate when she wants to? “Some in the disability community confuse value of life with quality of life and no one, disability or not, can make a judgment on quality of life except the person living the life. The main right she needs is the right to be herself, provided that self is fully-informed and gutsy,” says Ruth von Fuchs, president of Right to Die Canada. In Canada, assisted suicide is legal for those over 18 when death is “reasonably foreseeable.” But Bolen is only 14, and without action on her part, her death is not “reasonably foreseeable.” Bolen’s lack of information may be the problem, just no one in the media seems to mind. “If this was a nondisabled girl the same age who wants to end her life for similar reasons, would we be so quick to support it? Would the media be as eager to cover a person’s quest to raise money for an accessible van or home compared to a community-wide effort to put together her ‘Last Dance?” asks Wong. ||||| Published on Jul 20, 2016 Jerika Bolen, 14, who was diagnosed with Type 2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy, has decided to go on hospice and live out her final wishes over the summer including having a prom July, 22, 2016, at the Grand Meridian in Appleton, Wis.

She says she wants to \\"be free\\" and scheduled her own death. Now, disabled parent's activists are trying to intervene. Jerika Bolen and her mother Jen are illuminated by green fireworks Saturday, July 2, 2016 in Menominee, Mich. Danny Damiani/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) APPLETON, Wis. — Disability rights groups are attempting to intervene in an Appleton teenager’s decision to cease medical treatment and die of the incurable disease that has racked her body and left her in constant pain. Carrie Ann Lucas, executive director of the Colorado-based Disabled Parents Rights, said her organization is one of several that have asked for child-protection authorities to investigate the case of 14-year-old Jerika Bolen, whose decision to enter hospice care at the end of summer gained national attention. “A child doesn’t have the capacity to make those types of decisions, and under the eyes of the law, this is a child,” Lucas said Tuesday. Jerika suffers from Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2. She and her mother, Jen Bolen, said earlier this summer that Jerika would go without her ventilator while under hospice care in early September, essentially scheduling her own death. Her story drew an outpouring of support when her family, friends and her care team held a prom, dubbed Jerika's Last Dance, in late July. On Tuesday, Jen Bolen asked for privacy and declined further comment about her daughter's medical care. Melissa Blom, director of Outagamie County’s Children, Youth and Families Division, also declined comment on whether her office has received a referral or opened an investigation, citing the confidentiality of child-welfare cases. Jerika was diagnosed as a baby with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, often referred to as SMA. The incurable disease destroys nerve cells in the brain stem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle activity. Jerika has never walked, and today her movement is mostly limited to her head and hands. Jerika said she’s in constant pain — about a seven on a scale of one to 10 on her best days. She expressed concern that her pain and the need for more invasive medical interventions would grow as her body continues to deteriorate. Lucas, who said she is unaware of whether a child-protection investigation has commenced, said her organization is not asking that Jerika be removed from her mother’s care. “Foster care will not solve this problem,” she said. But Jerika is in need of mental health care, not additional support for ending her life, Lucas said. Lucas said four organizations sent a joint letter to the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families asking for intervention, and she followed up with a phone call to Outagamie County's Children, Youth and Families Division. The other organizations are Not Dead Yet, NMD United and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, Lucas said. Debate began to bubble as many reached out to celebrate Jerika's life in July. More than a 1,000 people arrived at a prom thrown in Jerika's honor as a last wish. Police and firefighters provided a motorcade. She received cards and gifts from around the world and shout-outs from a number of celebrities. But her decision also drew pleas that she change her mind, including from adults with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Jen Bolen, in a July interview, said those critical of Jerika's decision fail to understand the depth of medical intervention it’s taken for her to reach her teenage years. \\"I was fighting for my kid,\\" she said. \\"I never thought I'd be on this side of things.\\" Lucas, meanwhile, said Jerika's decision — and the support she's received — is an important issue to the disability rights community. Those with disabilities have equal rights to child protection, which includes efforts to ensure parents are acting in their children’s best interests, she said. Though Jerika's disease is progressive, it isn’t “acutely terminal,” Lucas said, and she questions whether simply withholding treatment would be sufficient to end her life quickly. When it’s a decision of death, “it’s never in the child’s best interests,” Lucas argued. Jerika’s story is far from the first time end-of-life decisions have drawn controversy. Perhaps the most famous case was that of Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged Florida woman who was taken off of life support in 2005 after a family battle and a national debate over decision-making authority. Diane Coleman, executive director of the anti-euthanasia organization Not Dead Yet, compared the Bolens’ situation to that of Julianna Snow, a 5-year-old Oregon girl who was given the choice by her parents on whether to continue medical treatment. Snow, who had an incurable neurodegenerative illness, chose against further hospitalization and died in June after spending 18 months in hospice care. Coleman questioned both cases based on their ages. But her organization views euthanasia as a form of discrimination against the old, ill and disabled. “I worry that there’s an attitude in the health care profession that really writes people off with disabilities,” she said. “I worry that people like Jerika and Julianna are in the throes of that, and without adequate support.” The withholding of treatment from the disabled was recently subject of court scrutiny in Wisconsin based on a lawsuit brought by the Disability Rights Wisconsin organization. In 2009, the organization sued five doctors from UW Health over their withholding of treatment from two developmentally disabled patients, including a 13-year-old boy they had placed in hospice care. Lawyers argued the boy would have recovered from pneumonia. The case was dismissed at the circuit court level, and in 2014, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld that decision, putting an end to the lawsuit.

(Photo: Danny Damiani/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) Attorneys for Disability Rights Wisconsin argued “parents had no right to direct the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment to their children who are not in (a persistent vegetative state.)” The court rejected the organization's arguments that withholding of care violated the patients' due process rights. Lisa Pugh, public policy director for Disability Rights Wisconsin, couldn’t be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Which language is this?","completion":"This sentence is in German. \\"Die Aussprache ist geschlossen\\" translates to \\"The discussion is closed\\" in English. German, or Deutsch, is a West Germanic language that is widely spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and other regions in Europe. German is known for its complex grammar rules, including gendered nouns, various cases, and long compound words. The language uses three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, each with their respective articles \\"der,\\" \\"die,\\" and \\"das.\\" In addition, nouns in German have four grammatical cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. These cases are used to show the function of a noun or pronoun in a sentence. German pronunciation is relatively straightforward compared to some other languages, as the pronunciation of words tends to follow consistent rules. The standard German consonants and vowels are similar to those in English; however, there are a few unique sounds, such as the guttural \\"ch\\" and the umlauted vowels \\"ä,\\" \\"ö,\\" and \\"ü.\\" The German language has a rich history that dates back to the Early Middle Ages. The Old High German period (6th to 11th centuries) saw the first significant written German texts, such as the Hildebrandslied, an epic poem written in the 8th century. During the Middle High German period (11th to 13th centuries), courtly literature flourished, including the works of the Minnesänger, who composed love songs and poems. One of the most significant historical events that influenced the German language was Martin Luther's translation of the Bible into German in the 16th century. This translation played a vital role in standardizing German grammar and vocabulary, which eventually led to the development of modern German. Today, German is spoken by more than 100 million people worldwide and is an official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. It is also an official language of the European Union. German is an essential second language for many Europeans, and learning the language can open doors to cultural experiences and business opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: At stake is the future of this country, torn between Russia and Europe, and riven by anger over the corruption and cronyism in Yanukovych’s government. For two months, a partnership of pro-Europe liberals, die-hard nationalists, and critics of the ruling family and its circle of oligarchs has carried out a protracted campaign of protest, almost all of it peaceful. That moment could be nearing an end. The deaths of three and possibly more activists shocked and energized the legions of protesters, who again turned out Wednesday evening. One of the victims was shot four times, medics said. Police denied they had used firearms, though they could be seen aiming rifles during the day. The dead are being portrayed as martyrs. The politicians broke off the talks after three hours, and the opposition leaders later delivered angry avowals of their determination to oust Yanukovych but said they planned to continue the dialogue Thursday. “If the president does not go forward” on a peaceful resolution, said Vitali Klitschko, head of the opposition UDAR party, “tomorrow we’ll go on the offensive.” As darkness fell, tens of thousands of protesters flocked through snow to be on hand to defend Independence Square, known to all simply as the Maidan, after fears spread that the police would try Wednesday night to clear the encampment, which has been in place since Nov. 21. They had twice swept away the young protesters on nearby Hrushevsky Street, by the stadium, but the opposition forces reclaimed the street each time. The aggressive police action occurred on Unification Day, a national holiday. It drove the already deep divide between Yanukovych and his opponents to the point where a negotiated settlement looks difficult. The two sides have just 24 hours to prevent bloodshed, Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the opposition Fatherland party said Wednesday night after he left the president’s office. “After that, if I get a bullet in my head, then so be it,” he said. “We’re going to kick the authorities out. We’re going to win and have the new Ukraine that we deserve,” said Oleh Tiahnybok, head of the nationalist Svoboda party, who also took part. The mood on the Maidan on Wednesday evening, as it filled with protesters, was serious but not grim. As young men in helmets and improvised body armor came and went from Hrushevsky Street, old women on the Maidan watched and made the sign of the cross. Youths furiously chipped away at the newly fallen but already packed snow, while others scooped it up into sandbags, to be used to bolster the formidable barricades built on foundations of ice and snow last month. Rain and warm weather have since caused considerable depletion, but the cold has returned, and that’s welcome news for the opposition. On Hrushevsky, protesters set alight piles of tires, sending thick black smoke westward across Kiev. Their goal was to create a smokescreen behind which they industriously constructed a fallback barricade in an attempt to prevent another police sweep. Many of those injured Wednesday were broadcast journalists and medics, leading to accusations that they had been deliberately targeted. All told, hundreds of injuries have been reported, on both sides. The activist beaten to death was Yuriy Verbytskiy, a resident of the western city of Lviv who was on Hrushevsky Street. He was kidnapped from a Kiev hospital Tuesday night after he had sought treatment for a splinter in his eye. Another man, Ihor Lutsenko, who was abducted with him, was beaten but later released. Verbytskiy’s body was found near the airport, according to his brother. The protest began when Yanukovych suddenly backed off a trade deal with Europe and turned to Russia for support. It quickly broadened to include demands that he step down. Throughout, protest leaders continually stressed the need to use peaceful means to pursue their ends. But Yanukovych hung on, and last week his party rammed through harsh new laws restricting protest and speech. On Sunday evening, a breakaway group of frustrated young nationalists, led by a group called Pravy Sektor, marched off the Maidan to Hrushevsky Street, where they were confronted by police and began throwing stones, fireworks and molotov cocktails at them. Police responded with stun grenades and rubber bullets. The confrontation on Hrushevsky Street persisted, and it complicated the task for opposition leaders who have denounced violence as self-defeating. But the sight of young men taking the fight to the police thrilled thousands of spectators who didn’t play a direct role in the clashes. The violence, and especially Wednesday’s escalation, seemed only to harden the resolve of both sides, even as the talks were getting underway. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said the opposition has to decide once and for all whether it will renounce the violence of the nationalists on Hrushevsky or embrace it and suffer take the consequences. He then flew off to an economic forum in Davos, Switzerland — though news agencies here reported that his invitation had been withdrawn. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev announced that it has revoked the visas of Ukrainians it deems responsible for the violence here. It said it would not identify those people, but official U.S. statements on the crisis suggest that those affected are probably Ukrainian government or police officials. In Washington, Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, released a statement saying that the United States “strongly condemns” the violence in Kiev. “Increased tensions in Ukraine are a direct consequence of the Ukrainian government’s failure to engage in real dialogue and the passage of anti-democratic legislation on January 16,” it said. “However, the aggressive actions of members of extreme-right group Pravy Sektor are not acceptable and are inflaming conditions on the streets and undermining the efforts of peaceful protesters. We likewise deplore violence by unofficial groups known as ‘titushki.’ “We also condemn the targeted attacks against journalists and peaceful protesters, including detentions.” The issue of thugs for hire, working on behalf of Yanukovych and known here as “titushki,” has become a potent addition to the grievances of the protesters. Opposition groups have been scouting the streets of Kiev the past two nights in search of titushki, who are accused of smashing cars and beating up passersby. At least a dozen young men have been rounded up and taken to the protest headquarters. Almost all of them are teenagers. The Interior Ministry declared that 40 people were “kidnapped” in Kiev on Tuesday night, clearly referring to what the opposition believes is an act of self-defense.

TEXT:The movie begins a with mentally-challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a Madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane. The movie examines the life of five womenAdela, Leire, Maricarmen, Anita & Isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes. Their shoes is the first superficial, yet affixed with some glancing meaning, clue we get at their fragile identities. In a theatrically embroidered and embellished way, a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's souls by the sole of her feet. The premise is risky and slightly contrived, but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good. What may have been light-hearted and superficial, quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes, seeing the love or lack thereof, the pain, the confusion, the hope, the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below... What a scene (!) , but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair. Moving along, a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi, while another has completely lost her husband emotionally, sexually, intellectually, but not physically. A ghost, a pending divorce reproach, regret & remorse. A new love? Can you love a mirage? Can you love the person in the mirror? Can you love someone you can't love? Or think you can't love? Can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless? Yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness? A lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution, definitive decision or effective healing. Maybe a elusive thought, a fleeting feeling, but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film. Live. Live again. Rewind the reel. Unveil the real, the important; the big stones (piedras) of life. The rest is just details.","completion":"Based on the description provided, the correct sentiment for this movie review is: 2). positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My friends and I did a lot of research on which buffet in Vegas was the best. The Wynn came up often, so we decided to go with it. It's also one of the most expensive, but I understood when I got there. Talk about gourmet! The selections in this buffet were definitely the fanciest I've seen. These are not your standards- there's a lot of diverse options from asian to hispanic to italian to american and more. One of my faves was the couscous, and there was an asparagus dish that was amazing. There were some dim sum and sushi selections. The star of the show was the snow crab legs- people were lining up. Lots of desserts- I'm not a huge dessert person, but the colors and variety were enough to lure me in for some ice cream, pastries and even a candied apple. I was somewhat surprised that my least favorite options were the meats- the beef, pork, chicken- all lackluster compared to the seafood and veggie options. Which was a little disappointing for how much we paid for the buffet. I would probably want to try a different one next time I'm in town, but I can definitely see why the Wynn is up there on the list.

The shot slowly moves closer and closer. Once it stops, the lighting quickly changes to reveal that the eye and nose form the shape of a man holding a knife.The film begins on October 31, 1963, a cold Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois. In the middle of a street stands a two-story white Victorian house. Someone begins walking toward it, and sees a 17-year-old Judith Margaret Myers (Sandy Johnson) through the front door, kissing her boyfriend (David Kyle) passionately. As they move towards the couch in the living room, the person outside follows them around the side of the house and watches through the window. The boyfriend asks Judith if they are alone and she replies that someone by the name of Michael is around someplace. Her boyfriend puts on a clown mask jokingly and kisses her. She laughs and tells him to take it off and he suggests that they go upstairs to have sex. They run up the staircase as the person outside the house follows them back around to the front. The Shape sees the light in the upstairs window go out and begins swiftly walking back to the side of the house through the kitchen door. Quickly, the Shape opens a drawer and grabs a very sharp knife. It begins slowly creeping through the dining and living rooms and reaches the bottom of the staircase. There, Judith's boyfriend is putting his shirt back on and leaving the house. Judith calls down the staircase for him to call her the next day. He takes one last look upward and quietly leaves.

Do these questions have the same meaning? What languages are Windows, Mac OS X and Linux written in? Is it easy to port apps written for Linux to run on Mac OS X? Pick from: (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"(1). no. These two questions address different aspects of the software and programming involved in the Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems, as well as the process of porting applications between platforms. Question 1: What languages are Windows, Mac OS X and Linux written in? This question asks about the programming languages used to develop the mentioned operating systems. Windows: The Windows operating system is primarily written in C, C++, and C#. Lower-level code, such as drivers and the kernel (the core part of the operating system), is primarily written in C and C++, while higher-level components and utilities are developed using a mixture of C, C++, and C#. Mac OS X: Mac OS X, also known as macOS, is based on the Unix-like operating system called Darwin, which is written primarily in C and C++. However, its user interface layer, called Aqua, is written in Objective-C. Additionally, macOS supports application development using programming languages such as Swift, Objective-C, AppleScript, and more. Linux: The Linux operating system is mostly written in C, which provides a high level of compatibility across various hardware platforms while still being an efficient and low-level language. Some parts are also written in Assembly, Python, and other scripting languages. The userland tools and applications for Linux are developed using a variety of languages, such as C, C++, Python, Perl, and others. Question 2: Is it easy to port apps written for Linux to run on Mac OS X? This question refers to the ease of converting or adapting applications developed for Linux to be compatible with Mac OS X. The process of porting applications between these platforms depends significantly on the nature of the specific application and the programming languages, libraries, and frameworks used in its development. Because Mac OS X is based on a Unix-like system, many command-line tools and applications can be ported between Linux and Mac OS X relatively easily. On the other hand, graphical applications may require more effort to adapt, particularly if they rely on platform-specific frameworks, libraries, or APIs. In some cases, porting a Linux application to Mac OS X can be facilitated using cross-platform development tools, libraries, or frameworks (e.g., Qt, GTK, or wxWidgets) that support both platforms. In other cases, the application may need to be rewritten or substantially modified to function correctly on Mac OS X, especially if it relies on Linux-specific functionality or interfaces. Ultimately, the ease or difficulty of porting an application from Linux to Mac OS X will depend on the specific circumstances and requirements of the application in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. The 2017 line up is; Chris Barber and Bob Hunt (trombones); Mike Henry and Pete Rudeforth (trumpets), Bert Brandsma, Nick White and Ian Killoran (clarinets and alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax). John Watson (drums), John Day (double bass), Joe Farler (banjo & guitar) Pat Halcox, trumpeter with the Chris Barber Band since 31 May 1954, retired after playing his last gig with the Big Chris Barber Band on 16 July 2008. Halcox and Barber were together in the band for 54 years - the longest continuous partnership in the history of jazz, exceeding even that of Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974). Tony Carter (reeds) also left the band at this time. Vic Pitt (double bass) retired in January 2007 after 30 years with the band. His feature duet with the drummers of the day - \\"Big Noise From Winnetka\\" was not only a feature of the Barber concerts, but also his time with the Kenny Ball band immediately before. When Amy Roberts joined the band in 2011, she was still a student at Royal Northern College of Music and thus not always able to be present. On several tours Bert Brandsma (reeds) replaced her. Brandsma joined as a permanent member in 2012. At St Luke's, London, on 9 June 2007 Barber appeared in the horn section of Nick Lowe's band during a concert. In 2008 Barber, along with Eric Clapton and others, were involved in a new co-operative record company, Blues Legacy.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the given equation, we will follow these steps: 1. Identify the equation: -6349 = 12 * n - 6469 2. Our goal is to isolate n. We do this by performing operations to both sides of the equation until we have n by itself on one side of the equation. 3. Let's first add 6469 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant on the right side: -6349 + 6469 = (12 * n - 6469) + 6469 This simplifies to: 120 = 12 * n 4. Now, we need to isolate n. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by 12: 120 / 12 = (12 * n) / 12 This simplifies to: 10 = n So, the solution to the equation -6349 = 12 * n - 6469 is n = 10."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In June 1963, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a major speech in Detroit that foreshadowed his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in Washington, D.C. two months later. While the African-American Civil Rights Movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades. It was the most costly riot in the United States.\\"?

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To charge a power drill battery,","completion":"To determine which solution is better for the goal of charging a power drill battery, let's evaluate some common charging methods and technologies available today. We will consider factors such as efficiency, convenience, cost, and charging time. Here are a few common charging approaches: 1. Traditional Wall Charger 2. Fast Charger 3. Solar Battery Charger 4. Wireless Charging 1. Traditional Wall Charger: A traditional wall charger is usually the standard accessory provided with a power drill when you purchase the tool. These chargers are designed to work with the specific battery type and voltage of your power tool. They plug directly into a wall socket and are connected to the battery for charging. Pros: - Generally included with the power drill purchase - Simple and easy to use - Reliable and consistent charging performance Cons: - Standard charging time can be longer compared to other methods (usually between 3-5 hours) - Tethered to a wall socket, limiting mobility 2. Fast Charger: A fast charger is designed to charge power drill batteries more quickly than traditional wall chargers. These chargers use advanced charging technology to regulate the flow of electricity and reduce charging time. Pros: - Reduced charging time (usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours) - May include smart charging features to prevent overcharging and extend battery life - Can potentially increase productivity by reducing downtime Cons: - More expensive than traditional wall chargers - May generate more heat while charging, which could impact battery life over time 3. Solar Battery Charger: A solar battery charger uses solar panels to harness energy from the sun and convert it into electricity to charge a power drill battery. This is an eco-friendly charging method that reduces reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Pros: - Environmentally friendly - No dependency on wall sockets, allowing for greater mobility - Potentially lower ongoing energy costs Cons: - Charging times may be longer and dependent on sunlight exposure - Less efficient in cloudy or low-light conditions - Initial setup costs can be higher compared to other methods 4. Wireless Charging: Wireless charging uses electromagnetic fields to transfer energy and charge a power drill battery without a wired connection. The battery is placed on a charging pad or in close proximity to the charging station, and the charging process begins. Pros: - Enhanced convenience due to the elimination of cords - Less wear and tear on charging ports of the battery - May include smart charging features Cons: - Slower charging times compared to fast chargers - Limited range of compatible power drill batteries - Additional expense for the wireless charging station Overall, the best solution for charging a power drill battery depends on individual preferences and needs. If convenience and reduced downtime are the highest priority, a fast charger may be the best choice due to its quick charging times and smart charging features. For those who are environmentally conscious and don't mind slightly longer charging times, a solar battery charger would be a suitable option. If the primary focus is ease-of-use and lower cost, a traditional wall charger will suffice. Lastly, for those who want to invest in a cord-free, modern charging method, wireless charging may be the ideal solution."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In-line skating is a fun sport that everyone can enjoy. Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there.

James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The vapor light is more energy-efficient than a regular light bulb. Here's a detailed and long answer to explain why this is the case and to provide some background information about street lights, vapor lights, and regular light bulbs. Street lights have evolved over the years to become more energy-efficient and provide better illumination for roads, sidewalks, and other outdoor areas. The two most common types of street lights are high-pressure sodium (HPS) vapor lights and light-emitting diode (LED) lights. When comparing these street lights to regular incandescent light bulbs, both HPS vapor lights and LED lights outperform in terms of energy efficiency, lifespan, and overall performance. High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) Vapor Lights: High-pressure sodium vapor lights are a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) lighting that has been widely used for street lighting applications since the 1970s. The HPS light contains a mix of xenon, sodium, and mercury gases in a ceramic arc tube. When an electric current is passed through the tube, it ionizes the gases and produces a bright yellow-orange light. Energy efficiency: HPS lights are much more energy-efficient than regular incandescent light bulbs. Typically, an HPS light can produce 50-140 lumens per watt, while an incandescent light bulb produces only about 15 lumens per watt. As a result, HPS lights require less wattage to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent bulb, leading to lower energy consumption and electricity costs. Light-emitting Diode (LED) Lights: LED lights are semiconductor devices that emit light when an electric current passes through them. In recent years, they have become the preferred choice for street lighting due to their long lifespan, environmental friendliness, and energy efficiency. Energy efficiency: LED lights are even more energy-efficient than HPS lights, with an efficacy of up to 100-150 lumens per watt. Due to their energy-efficient nature, LEDs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease the overall energy consumption of streetlights. In conclusion, if we only consider energy efficiency, the vapor lights (HPS) outperform the regular incandescent light bulbs. However, LED lights are now the most energy-efficient option available on the market for street lighting applications. Additionally, they offer other benefits, such as longer life, improved color rendering, and reduced maintenance costs. As a result, LED lights are now being installed in many cities worldwide as part of energy-saving initiatives and to create safer and more visually appealing urban environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: when did france and great britain declare war on germany?","completion":"France and Great Britain declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, in response to Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. The invasion marked the beginning of World War II, a devastating global conflict that lasted until 1945. The root cause of the war lied in the unresolved issues and resentments from World War I. After the Treaty of Versailles – signed on June 28, 1919 – Germany suffered significant territorial losses, crippling economic reparations, and military limitations. The treaty left the German nation humiliated and discontented, giving rise to radical political groups such as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) led by Adolf Hitler. In 1933, Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany and implemented aggressive expansionist policies, violating the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria followed by the Munich Agreement in September 1938, through which Germany seized the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939, Germany proceeded to occupy the remaining territories of Czechoslovakia, violating the Munich Agreement. The invasion of Poland was the culmination of Germany's aggressive actions and prompted France and Great Britain to act. Both countries had signed mutual defense pacts with Poland earlier in the year, promising to protect Polish sovereignty. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, causing France and Great Britain to issue ultimatums demanding the immediate withdrawal of German forces from Poland. Germany ignored these ultimatums leading France and Great Britain to formally declare war on Germany on September 3, 1939. The war eventually resulted in the formation of two major opposing alliances: the Allies, which mainly consisted of France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and the Axis Powers, led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. World War II resulted in millions of casualties, widespread destruction, and immense human suffering. The war concluded in September 1945 with the unconditional surrender of Germany to the Allies, marking the end of Hitler's Third Reich and the advent of a new world order shaped by the collaboration of the victorious powers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.'' But no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Republican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \\"absolutely unacceptable.\\" Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \\"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \\"are just plain despicable.\\" Vela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 — well before Trump's ancestors.

Imagine you have 779 apples and someone gives you 14 more apples. So let's count: 779 apples + 14 apples = 793 apples Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -61*y - 793 In order to get y alone, we need to move 793 to the other side of the equal sign. When we move a number to the other side, we change its sign. Since -793 is negative, when we move it to the other side, it will become positive: 0 + 793 = -61*y Which is the same as: 793 = -61*y Almost done! Now, we need to get y alone. We have -61 times y, so we need to divide both sides by -61 to solve for y. It's like sharing 793 pieces of candy equally among -61 (hungry, but imaginary) friends: 793 ÷ -61 = y And when we divide, we get: -13 = y So, the answer is: y = -13 If that was a bit complicated, just remember that we solved the puzzle to find that y is equal to -13."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: A colorful pebble falls on a goldfish, where is the pebble? Possible A: aquarium, creek, pet store, playground, pond Why is \\"aquarium\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Aquarium\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. When presented with the question involving a colorful pebble and a goldfish, a person with common sense would deduce that the most likely place for these two objects to come into contact would be in an environment that typically houses both elements. 1. Compatibility with the Goldfish's natural habitat: Goldfish are aquatic creatures that typically live in freshwater environments. An aquarium is specifically designed to house water-dwelling creatures like fish, providing a controlled and well-maintained ecosystem. It is a suitable environment where a goldfish can survive and thrive, making it a reasonable answer that aligns with human common sense. 2. Commonly used to house pet goldfish: Many people around the world keep goldfish as pets, and often they are housed in aquariums within their homes. Aquariums are a popular choice for displaying and caring for fish, as they provide the necessary conditions such as clean water, aeration, temperature control, and other essential factors that ensure the well-being of these aquatic pets. 3. Frequent presence of pebbles in aquariums: Aquariums often contain pebbles and other colorful substrates to enhance their visual appeal and create a more natural habitat for the fish. Pebbles serve as both a decorative feature and a functional element in the aquarium, providing shelter for the fish and contributing to the maintenance of healthy water conditions. 4. Limited likelihood of other options: When compared to the other possible answers – creek, pet store, playground, and pond – the probability of a colorful pebble falling on a goldfish is highest within an aquarium. While goldfish can exist in creeks and ponds, these natural environments tend to contain less colorful pebbles, and the likelihood of one specifically falling on a goldfish is much lower.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. When Trump ultimately made his decision last week to... According to the above context, answer the following question. When did Tillerson learn of his termination?

For the first batch of batter, add a few drops of red food coloring or edible gel paste to the bowl and stir with a clean spoon until the color is fully incorporated. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired intensity. Repeat with the blue and yellow food coloring. You can actually use any colors you like for tie-dye cupcakes, and can also use more than just three colors. Be sure to use a fresh bowl and a fresh spoon for each batch of colored batter, otherwise the colors will become muddy. You can also mix and match food coloring to achieve different colors. For instance, you can mix blue and red to achieve purple. To have white in your mix, leave one of the bowls of batter uncolored. Prepare a cupcake tin by lining it with white cupcake liners. Into the bottom of each liner, drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of red batter. Then place one or two spoons of yellow batter on top of that, followed by an equal quantity of blue batter on top. Stop when the liners are filled half way. You can layer the colors in any way you like, and don’t have to use the red, yellow, blue pattern. different spoons for each color. If you're using more colors, use ½ to 1 tablespoon (7.5 to 15 ml) of batter for each color. Instead of spooning the colors into the liners, you can also transfer each batter color to a separate pastry bag, and pipe in the batters one color at a time. To create the tie-dye effect, take a clean toothpick and gently swirl around the batter in each liner. Don’t mix too much, or you will end up blending the colors and they’ll become muddy. You can create circular tie-dye patterns by swirling the toothpick in circles. Create wavy patterns by zig zagging the toothpick in the batter. Make tie-dye spikes by dipping the toothpick into the batter in a few places and pulling it straight out. This will lift the bottom batter colors to the top.","completion":"Create tie-dye cupcakes by dividing batter into separate bowls, adding different food coloring to each, layering the colored batter in cupcake liners, and swirling with a toothpick for a tie-dye effect."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In 1933, a child orphaned during the Ukrainian Holodomor runs away from his orphanage and is taken in by a Red Army unit and adopted by its kindly commander, who gives him the name Leo Demidov. In 1945, now a sergeant with the unit, Leo becomes an icon across the Soviet Union when he is photographed planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag during the Battle of Berlin. He becomes a Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa and living in Moscow, is a captain in the Ministry of State Security, commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky, and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin, shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun, and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters. Angry, Leo strikes Vasili, who harbours growing resentment against Leo and the other officer in the unit, Alexei Andreyev; all three were in Berlin together in 1945. Vasili is in charge of Brodsky's interrogation and execution, and one of the names he gives to their superior, Major Kuzmin, is that of Raisa, a primary school teacher, several of whose colleagues have recently been arrested for dissident views.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Although Questions 1 and 2 are related, they are not exactly the same. Let's break down the nuances of these questions. Question 1: \\"How do one feel happy when one is lonely?\\" This question is focused on understanding how an individual can gain a sense of happiness while experiencing loneliness. It targets the strategies and mechanisms that may help in overcoming the feelings of loneliness and moving towards a happier state of mind. Question 2: \\"What's a happy thing to do when you feel sad and lonely?\\" This question is more action-oriented by asking for specific activities or actions that can be taken to immediately improve one's mood when they feel both sad and lonely. It implies that a quick fix may be in the form of a single action, as opposed to a broader state of mind. Though similar, these questions ask for different kinds of responses. Here's a detailed answer for each question: Question 1: How do one feel happy when one is lonely? Finding happiness while being lonely can be achieved through multiple approaches: 1. Self-reflection: Take the opportunity to explore your thoughts and emotions and gain a better understanding of yourself. Use this time for introspection and personal growth. 2. Develop hobbies: Engaging in hobbies or learning new skills can give you a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment, making you feel happier even when you are alone. 3. Connect with nature: Spending time outdoors, going for a walk, or simply sitting in a park can help you feel a sense of connectedness to the world, which can combat feelings of loneliness. 4. Practice gratitude: Focus on the positive aspects of your life and what you are thankful for. Keeping a gratitude journal or mentally listing the things you are grateful for can help shift your mindset toward a happier one. 5. Maintain a routine: Creating a daily routine can provide structure and purpose in your life, even when you're feeling lonely. 6. Mindfulness and meditation: These practices can help you become more present in the moment, gain a sense of inner peace, and alleviate feelings of loneliness. Question 2: What's a happy thing to do when you feel sad and lonely? Here are some activities you can engage in when you feel sad and lonely: 1. Reach out to a friend or family member: Sometimes, a simple conversation can remind you that you aren't alone, and your loved ones are always there to support you. 2. Watch a funny movie or TV show: Laughter is a natural mood booster. Watching something funny can help take your mind off your feelings of sadness and loneliness. 3. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins, which can help improve your mood. Going for a walk, run, or participating in a group exercise class can be a great way to lift your spirits. 4. Listen to uplifting music: Music has a powerful effect on our emotions. Create a playlist of your favorite feel-good songs and listen to it when you're feeling down. 5. Volunteer or help someone in need: Acts of kindness and generosity can boost your happiness level and reduce feelings of loneliness. Find a local organization where you can volunteer, or simply offer help to a friend, family member, or neighbor. 6. Engage in creative pursuits: Painting, writing, cooking, or playing a musical instrument can serve as an outlet for your emotions and provide you with a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. In conclusion, while both questions are related to dealing with loneliness, they focus on different aspects. Question 1 asks how individuals can feel happy despite feelings of loneliness, whereas question 2 seeks specific activities to create happiness when experiencing sadness and loneliness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Conserving resources has a positive impact on the environment, and recycling conserves natural resources. Given these facts, what has a positive impact on the environment among the following options: - patch reefs - coral - animals - recycling - power - ferns - bushes - Green beans A:","completion":"Recycling has a positive impact on the environment among the given options. While patch reefs, coral, animals, ferns, bushes, and green beans all play crucial roles in ecosystem function and biodiversity, they are not actions that directly contribute to the conservation of resources. On the other hand, recycling is a human action that serves to conserve natural resources and reduce negative impacts on the environment. To understand the positive environmental impact of recycling, let us examine some of its benefits: 1. Reduction of Waste: Recycling helps to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and incinerators. Landfills contribute to environmental degradation and release toxic chemicals into the soil and air, while incinerators produce harmful emissions and toxic ash. By repurposing waste materials into new products, recycling helps limit these detrimental effects on the environment. 2. Conservation of Natural Resources: Recycling allows for the efficient use of limited resources and reduces the demand for extracting raw materials. For example, recycling paper reduces the need to cut down trees and conserves forests, which in turn benefits the numerous species that rely on them for habitat. Additionally, the recycling of metals, such as aluminum and steel, reduces the need for mining and the associated environmental damage. 3. Energy Efficiency: The production of new goods using recycled materials requires less energy than producing goods from virgin materials. Recycling aluminum cans, for example, is estimated to save up to 95% of the energy needed to produce new cans from raw materials. Not only does this conserve resources, but it also decreases greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy production. 4. Reduction of Pollution: The use of recycled materials in production often results in lower emissions of greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and water pollutants compared to using raw materials. Additionally, recycling can help prevent hazardous waste, such as electronic components, from ending up in landfills and polluting the environment. 5. Sustainable Development: Recycling supports sustainable development by encouraging the responsible management of resources, increasing resource efficiency, and fostering the principle of a circular economy, in which materials are continuously cycled through economic processes rather than being simply discarded after only one use. In conclusion, recycling is the option among those listed that has a positive impact on the environment. Through the reduction of waste, conservation of natural resources, improved energy efficiency, reduced pollution, and promotion of sustainable development, recycling serves to lessen the burden on ecosystems and help protect the Earth for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The infant Jason is spirited away by one of Aristo's soldiers. Pelias slays one of the king's daughters, Briseis (Davina Taylor), as she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess Hera (Honor Blackman). Because the murder has profaned her temple, the angry Hera becomes Jason's protector. She warns Pelias to beware \\"of a man wearing one sandal\\". Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong) saves Pelias from drowning (orchestrated by Hera), but loses his sandal in the river; Pelias recognizes him from the prophecy. Learning that Jason intends to find the legendary Golden Fleece, he encourages him, hoping Jason will be killed in the attempt. Jason is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. Hera tells him Zeus has decreed he can only call upon her for aid five times. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis. Zeus offers his direct aid, but Jason declares he can organize the voyage, build a ship, and collect a crew of the bravest men in all Greece. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor. Because their ship is named the Argo after her builder, Argus (Laurence Naismith), the crew are dubbed the Argonauts. Among them are Hercules (Nigel Green), Hylas (John Cairney), and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, sent by his father to sabotage the voyage. Hera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a treasure building, surmounted by a gigantic statue of Talos, which comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos' heel, to release the giant's ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas, hiding his body.

That’s right. That’s the theme of my house. Nobody else has that theme.” Griffin, 55, leads the way up a stone-clad spiral staircase to a light-filled living area she picks up one of her two Emmys, and as is her MO, makes a tongue-in-cheek shameless plug. “These are my Emmys. I don’t know if you know I have two Emmys. You probably do, right?” she says, pausing to pose with the award and smile for the camera.

She still wants me to be a dental hygienist.” RELATED: Watch: Everything You Need to Know About Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s 60 Million French Chateau Leading the way into a massive kitchen with two freestanding islands, she explains “I happen to have a spacious and palatial kitchen. The best part is I don’t technically cook…anything…at all.” Unless, you count making cookie dough and crying, which she reveals are the main uses of the space. Signing off Griffin gets serious for just a second: “Look, the house is light, bright and fun,” she says. “Come back anytime.” Watch full episodes of Hollywood at Home now at People/Entertainment Weekly Network.

Flashbacks reveal that his wife (Salli Richardson) and daughter (Willow Smith) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced quarantine of the island in 2009, when Neville stayed behind on the island as military personnel. Neville's only mitigation for his loneliness is his German Shepherd named Samantha, a.k.a. Sam (given to him by his daughter as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day, while waiting for survivors, Sam follows a deer into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer's corpse along with Sam, but the building is infested by a colony of Darkseekers.

Summarize the following: To make this traditional Jamaican treat, you only need a few simple ingredients: 2 brown coconuts 1 cup of fresh ginger, diced 2 cups of golden brown sugar, packed 3 cups of water Take your fresh brown coconuts and use a screwdriver to poke holes through the eyes of the nut. Drain the coconut water from the center of the coconuts -- use or discard as you wish! Use a hammer to crack the coconuts open and use a butter knife to pry the coconut meat from the shell. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the brown outer layer from the meat, then use a knife to dice the coconut. Tip: You can make it easier to remove the coconut meat from the shell by baking the drained coconut in a 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Allow the coconut to become cool to the touch before cracking with the hammer. Combine the diced coconut, diced ginger, brown sugar and water in a heavy bottomed-saucepan and place over a medium heat. Stir the mixture continuously with a large spoon until it boils and the sugar starts to caramelize. Keep stirring as the mixture thickens to prevent the sugar from sticking to bottom and sides of the saucepan. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature -- you want it to reach approximately 295 °F (146 °C). Once the sugar has caramelized nicely and the mixture becomes very difficult to stir, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Working quickly, spoon drops of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with waxed paper, using about two tablespoons of mixture per coconut drop. Allow the drops to cool and harden before eating.

I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.

And the answer is?","completion":"The comic hero created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939 is Batman. Batman is one of the most iconic and enduring characters in the world of comic books and beyond. Batman debuted in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. It was in this issue that readers were first introduced to the wealthy Bruce Wayne, who by night turns into Batman, a compelling crime fighter. The co-creators of Batman are Bob Kane and Bill Finger. Bob Kane was an American comic book writer and artist most famously known for co-creating Batman and several of the superhero’s iconic villains. He was born as Robert Kahn on October 24, 1915, in New York City. In contrast, Bill Finger was born on February 8, 1914, and he, too, was a native of New York. Bill Finger was initially brought in by Kane to help add to the initial design of the character, which Kane had begun. Finger played a significant role in adding several iconic elements to the character of Batman, including his dark look, the city of Gotham, and the character’s lack of superpowers. What started as a mere comic book endeavor quickly snowballed into a phenomenon. This is because Batman as a character connected with readers in ways that few characters had before. He was human, had no superpowers, and battled inner demons, even as he fought off crime in Gotham City. This element of depth made Batman a beloved hero among readers and continued to appeal to subsequent generations, ensuring his survival and popularity. Over the years, Batman has evolved and taken on many shapes and forms, both in the comic book pages and on screen. The character has been featured in multiple television shows, films, video games, and other media, gaining global recognization. Despite the vast array of interpretations, the core essence of Batman, the superhero who straddles the line between light and dark, upholds justice, fights crime and represents human resilience, remains the same. The character continues to be celebrated and remains alive in the hearts of youngsters and adults alike, seven decades after he was first introduced by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. Their creation, Batman, continues to strike a chord with every individual who looks up to things greater than life itself, giving them hope and faith, making them believe in righteousness and justice. That's the power of Batman and such is the legacy of Bob Kane and Bill Finger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Article:","completion":"Title: Youth Football Coach Sentenced to 15 Years for Horrific Sexual Offenses Youth football coach, Andrew Faulds, age 40, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty of a series of harrowing sex offenses, including the rape of a 13-year-old girl with severe learning difficulties. The long-standing children's worker, whose despicable actions have left a lasting impact on his victims and their families, was caught and subsequently arrested after a video of the evil act was discovered on his mobile phone. The horrifying discovery was made by police officers who were executing a search warrant at Faulds' residence. In addition to the video evidence, the officers also found hundreds of indecent images of children on Faulds' laptop. Faulds admitted to the string of sex offenses, including the rape of the young girl, after his arrest, leading to his eventual conviction and sentencing. The severe consequences of Faulds' actions extend far beyond his own personal punishment and have a profound effect on his young victims, their families and the community as a whole. The trust placed in Faulds as a football coach and as a mentor to children was shattered by his heinous crimes and serves as a grim reminder of the potential dangers that lurk in every corner of society. As a youth football coach and children's worker, Faulds was skillfully positioned at the heart of his community and manipulated his role to gain access to vulnerable children whom he would later betray. While parents and guardians placed their faith in the man responsible for nurturing and guiding their children, Faulds used his opportunity to commit unspeakable acts that have marred both the lives of his victims and their families forever. The long-lasting impact of Faulds' sex offenses will undoubtedly leave a dark shadow in the community where he once held a role of responsibility and trust. As society grapples with the realization that such sinister acts can be carried out by those you least expect, it is essential for parents, guardians, and community members to remain vigilant in their interactions with authority figures. Mandatory background checks and thorough monitoring procedures should be implemented by organizations and institutions that cater to children. Implementing safer recruitment practices and offering continuous training to staff on safeguarding children will create a more secure environment for young people now and in the future. While it may not be possible to predict or prevent every potential threat, it is of the utmost importance to take measured, reasonable precautions to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. In conclusion, the conviction and sentencing of Andrew Faulds serve as a sobering reminder of the hidden dangers that can exist in the most trusted of roles. As a society, we must work diligently to safeguard our children, ensuring that those who prey on the vulnerable are brought to justice. Let Faulds' 15-year sentence serve as a much-needed wake-up call to communities everywhere, inspiring them to remain vigilant in their quests to protect the innocent and vulnerable from the wicked and depraved individuals hidden among us."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But on the whole, the plot is very clichéd, as is its seeming message. If you're a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw, you'll love it. If you're looking for something at all high-brow, steer away. I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing.

Although they acknowledge that the visual elements of the film were impressive and there were some enjoyable comedic moments, the overall tone of the comments is negative. Words like 'grinding', 'unpleasant to sit through', and indicating that it failed to be 'disturbing' (which was their initial pursuit) convey a clear dissatisfaction with the movie. The suggestion to 'steer away' from the movie if looking for a more 'high-brow' experience and the recommendation to watch another film ('The Lost') if one seeks a challenging film also demonstrate a negative sentiment. Furthermore, the recommendation they give for people who want to 'be grossed out' or talk about a 'messed up film', suggest that the movie did not meet the intellectual or aesthetic standards of this reviewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Among the alleged targets: Sens. John McCain, Joe Lieberman, Jack Reed, Al Franken and Carl Levin; Rep. Steve Israel of the House Appropriations Committee -- and Adm.

Over a four-month period last year, a military cell devoted to what is known as \\"information operations\\" at Camp Eggers in Kabul was repeatedly pressured to target visiting senators and other VIPs who met with Caldwell. When the unit resisted the order, arguing that it violated U.S. laws prohibiting the use of propaganda against American citizens, it was subjected to a campaign of retaliation. \\"My job in psy-ops is to play with people's heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave,\\" says Lt.

The stuff with Rich was a different process for me. I never sat down and said, OK, I'm writing songs now for this or for that. I wasn't choosing this subject or that subject. It seemed to work with the music and I didn't want to edit that. I didn't want to bend it into a different direction. It was really a pure process, and I think you hear that. \\"I Can't Stay\\" was one of the first things I worked on. When I sent it back to Rich, he was blown away by what I'd done over the guitar chords he'd given to me and it started the process between us. These songs really kind of wrote themselves. I can't describe it in any better way. I just had to get out of the way, really. CNN: Speaking of blessed, you explore spirituality on this album, especially on \\"Presence of God,\\" and have said that may make people uncomfortable. Sure, it's more direct than what Depeche Mode usually does, but was it really such a major departure? Gahan: Not at all. I think that's because Martin [Gore] and I shake from the same hip as well. In the past, especially in the \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" period, I felt like Martin was writing songs about me or for me. He wasn't really; I was younger then. But we had those same doubts, and quite often seemed to experience the same weird, dark sense of humor. \\"Presence of God\\" is really that understanding that sometimes when you step out of your own shoes and just open your ears and listen to what's going on around you, you get answers to the questions you were asking. The title \\"The Light the Dead See\\" works so well because sometimes when you're still and not trying to steer things in a certain way is really when the magic can happen. It's when I'm trying to figure that out for myself that I get into all kinds of trouble. CNN: It's a delicate balance to explore these subjects in your lyrics and not alienate the audience by coming across as tortured or preachy. How did you manage to pull it off? Gahan: I'm glad you heard that. There was no torture at all. It really came easy, this stuff. For me, that doubt and that faith are so close. It's impossible to deny that happening around you when you really kind of let go of trying to control things. But it's not hokey in any way. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. It's purely my experience of feeling like I really belong, and then moments of really what the f--k am I doing? We all have that. I tried to keep that as open as possible without directing. I don't want to direct you. I want you to listen and conjure up your own thoughts. CNN: The album is beautiful -- both melancholy and uplifting at the same time. How did you go about hitting those emotional nerves? Gahan: I think some of that stuff comes from the way I used my voice. I go to a very visual place when I'm singing. It's very cinematic and I get this feeling of space. I love when music does that. I listened to David Bowie a lot when I was a teenager. The place that he seemed to be singing from is the place that I wanted to go to. I didn't know if that place really existed, but I believed it did. I tried to capture that same magic again on this record. It's a place you go to when you listen, where you just feel a sense of belonging. Or, not feeling a sense of belonging and that being OK. CNN: Is there any one Bowie line, image or album that was able to transport you more than others? Gahan: There's many records that have been pivotal for me. If I were to name one, it would be \\"Ziggy Stardust.\\" It changed my life. The same thing happened when punk rock came along and I heard the Clash for the first time. I was 16 or 17 years old. It made me feel like I belonged to something. Music has always done that and continues to do that for me. Lately, a record that I bought that I'm really listening to a lot is the new Spiritualized album, \\"Sweet Heart Sweet Light.\\" There's a sense of humor to me in the combination of his words and his musical styles. It just spoke to me and brought a smile to my face. Some may listen to that record and not get the same feeling, but it's really uplifting and a beautiful record. CNN: You are currently recording your 13th Depeche Mode album. Can you give us a hint about what we can expect? Gahan: Martin's been particularly prolific, and myself as well. I was doing the Soulsavers thing and writing demos for Depeche Mode with a friend. Martin got on a writing streak. He's got some really great songs. We usually start a record with six or seven songs; we currently have about 20. In the studio, we're trying to not over-fuss things. We're trying to not over-produce the sound. If something's working, we're just recording it. We're trying to get the element of performance into the record more. We've already been talking to Anton Corbijn about some ideas we have about where we want to take the record visually and he usually has a pretty great angle. The songs have a bluesy influence. Obviously, it's not a blues record, but there's definitely some of those influences there. And it has a kind of soulful feel as well. It's still early so it's difficult to tell at this stage. We've been making records for a long time together, but there's always an element of surprise when it comes to the way a Depeche Mode record is really going to sound -- even for ourselves.

Article:","completion":"Title: Changes in England's Top Order and the Importance of Adapting During the World Cup A year ago, it would have been unthinkable to imagine Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, and Gary Ballance as England's top three in One-Day cricket. However, recent alterations in the line-up show that this format of the game is still not a priority for England's management. With the 2015 Cricket World Cup currently underway, England now face the challenge of maintaining a consistent top order to ensure success throughout the tournament. The late changes in England's ODI line-up reveal the team's lack of focus on one-day cricket. This could be attributed to an emphasis on Test cricket, which England is traditionally known for excelling in. However, this lack of priority has the potential to prove detrimental to England's performance during the Cricket World Cup. Despite the surprising inclusion of Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, and Gary Ballance in the top order, Ravi Bopara, a previous regular in the squad, cannot express disappointment as his recent performances have not been sound enough to secure him a spot. Bopara's current form does not warrant his inclusion in the top order, and the team must move forward without him. One of the concerns facing England's cricket team during the World Cup is the lack of diversity in their bowling attack. The current squad's bowling is relatively one-dimensional, featuring predominantly fast bowlers. This could prove problematic as opposing teams become used to the consistent pace. England must develop a Plan B in the event that their primary bowling strategy fails to deliver results. Captain Eoin Morgan will play a crucial role in guiding the team to adapt and succeed during the World Cup. Morgan must rely on his instincts and experience to make crucial decisions during matches. At times, this may mean going against conventional wisdom or established strategies. However, the ability to make such decisions is what sets successful captains apart from the rest. It is worth noting the impressive performances put forth by associate nations during the World Cup so far. Teams like Ireland, Afghanistan, and Scotland have shown that they have the potential to cause upsets against more established cricketing nations. England must not underestimate these opponents and should prepare thoroughly to avoid falling behind. With the tournament in full swing, England now has the opportunity to settle their top order and hone their strategies to ensure success in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. By acknowledging the importance of one-day cricket and adapting to various challenges that come their way, England's cricket team can pursue their ultimate goal of becoming world champions.

Solve -20 = 6*y + 10 for y.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like a little story: We have this equation: -20 = 6*y + 10 1. Our goal is to find out what \\"y\\" is! 2. Let's look at the numbers. We have \\"10\\" on the right side of the equation and we want to get rid of it. To do that, we can do the opposite action. So, let's subtract 10 from both sides. Now, we get: -20 - 10 = 6*y 3. That gives us: -30 = 6*y 4. Now, we have \\"6*y,\\" which means 6 times y. To find out what \\"y\\" is, we're going to do the opposite action again. Instead of multiplying, we will divide both sides by 6. So, let's divide -30 by 6: -30 ÷ 6 = y 5. Finally, we get the answer: y = -5 So, the solution to the math problem is y = -5!

Michael Morse, Steve Lombardozzi, Danny Espinosa and Strasburg each had an RBI for the Nationals, winners in seven of their last 10. Tyler Clippard pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth to secure the win for Washington. Emilio Bonifacio doubled and Greg Dobbs had a pair of hits for Miami, which has lost four of its last five. Ricky Nolasco (8-7) was pegged with the loss after giving up all four runs on six hits with two strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings. The Nationals scored a pair of two-out runs in the fifth. Espinosa reached on a fielder's choice, then moved to second when Roger Bernadina grounded out. Nolasco intentionally walked Jhonatan Solano to put runners at first and second for Strasburg, who singled to right to plate Espinosa. Lombardozzi followed with a single to bring Solano home.

Q: Context: Recent randomized trials suggest that intensive glycaemic control fails to reduce heart failure-related events in patients with diabetes. The molecular cues underlying persistent myocardial damage despite normoglycaemia restoration remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, orchestrate transcriptional programs implicated in adverse cardiac remodelling. The present study investigates whether miRNAs participate to hyperglycaemic memory in the diabetic heart.', 'miRNA landscape was assessed by Mouse miRNome miRNA PCR Arrays in left ventricular specimens collected from 4-month-old streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, with or without intensive glycaemic control by slow-release insulin implants. A dysregulation of 316 out of 1008 total miRNAs was observed in the diabetic hearts when compared with controls. Of these, 209 were up-regulated and 107 were down-regulated by >2.0-fold. Interestingly enough, the expression of 268 of those miRNAs remained significantly altered in diabetic mice even after subsequent normoglycaemia. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that dysregulated miRNAs were implicated in myocardial signalling networks triggering apoptosis (miR-320b, miR-378, miR-34a), fibrosis (miR-125b, miR-150, miR-199a, miR-29b, miR30a), hypertrophic growth (miR-1, miR-150, miR-199a, miR-133a, miR-214, miR-29a, miR-125b, miR-221, miR-212), autophagy (miR-133a, miR-221, miR-212, miR30a), oxidative stress (miR-221, miR-146a, miR-34a, miR-210, miR-19b, miR-125b, miR27a, miR-155), and heart failure (miR-423, miR-499, miR-199a), respectively.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. After the trade discussion Trump is most likely doing what? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Still looking for a double edged sword - Still reading the 232 report - not enough information - Still considering imposing tariffs Answer:","completion":"Still considering imposing tariffs"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like \\"Society Pages\\" and \\"I'm a Beautiful... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar?, what is it ?

Summarize this article: Last week, the head of exam watchdog Ofqual suggested some schools were making \\"strategic\\" use of challenges to A-level and GCSE grades. But the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference said the \\"real issue is inaccurate marking\\". Ofqual has said it is planning improvements to the appeal process. The university sector's Supporting Professionalism in Admissions organisation has also called for \\"greater clarity\\" about the rising numbers of appeals and grades being changed. Director Janet Graham said: \\"This is an area that the awarding organisations and Ofqual could explore in more depth.\\" Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey faced questions last week from the Education Select Committee about the process of challenging exam results. Ms Stacey told MPs she wanted a system that was \\"swift, effective and fair\\". In the past four years, the number querying results has more than doubled to more than 400,000 and the number getting their grades changed after re-marking has also more than doubled to more than 77,000. But Chris King, Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) chairman and headmaster of Leicester Grammar School, said there needed to be much more transparency and information about the grades being challenged and changed. He also criticised the suggestion the increase in appeals was being driven by schools gaming the system to improve their grades \\"It is misleading to imply that schools who appeal wrong grades are actually a cause of the problem. This is a smokescreen,\\" said Mr King. Instead he blamed \\"inconsistent marking and grading and a Byzantine appeals process, which Ofqual itself acknowledges is inadequate\\". \\"Any suggestion that schools of any kind are 'gaming' the appeals system is unfair and underserved,\\" said Mr King. Exam boards charge for re-marking, unless there is a grade changed, with schools and parents paying millions of pounds each year. \\"Independent schools submit proportionally more appeals but naturally state schools put in far more than we do, and we welcome this. Ultimately this is about justice for hard working pupils, whatever school they go to,\\" said Mr King. Ofqual has said that only about 1% of the overall exam results are subsequently changed and that proposals to improve the process of appealing against GCSE and A-level results would be announced later this month.","completion":"Recently, the number of schools challenging exam grades went up and the head of exam watchdog Ofqual thinks some schools are using this as a way to get better grades. But the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference said the real problem is that the grades are not being marked correctly. Ofqual is working on making the process for challenging exam grades better, and a university group also wants more information about why there are more challenges and grade changes.

A:","completion":"A: Yes, this product review is indeed negative. The reviewer has expressed disappointment in the movie \\"The Road to Christmas\\" due to the use of foul language and presence of LGBTQ+ content. They feel that these elements are not suitable for a Christmas movie and blame Hollywood for spoiling the overall experience. The review's tone can be interpreted as negative through various points. First, the opening statement directly states \\"very disappointed,\\" clearly highlighting the dissatisfaction the reviewer experienced. Second, the reviewer is highly critical of the inclusion of foul language and gay characters, which they believe do not belong in a Christmas movie. This disapproval further emphasizes the negative nature of their review. Additionally, the reviewer holds Hollywood responsible for tarnishing the experience, implying that the movie industry has a negative impact on the quality and content of the film. This statement not only reinforces the negative sentiment expressed in the review, but it also expands the criticism to include the broader film industry.

They massacre the ranch hands and kidnap Little Jake, the grandson, leaving a ransom note and heading back for Mexico, where they have been hiding out. Martha, the head of the family, is offered the help of both the army and the Texas Rangers in hunting the gang.

Then his son Michael rides up on a motorcycle, bringing word that he has seen the kidnappers in the Chilicothe Canyon. The Texas Ranger captain is present and offers the services of his men, equipped with three REO touring cars. They, however, are ambushed and their cars put out of action. Jake, preferring the old ways, has followed on horseback, accompanied by an old Apache associate, Sam Sharpnose. He is now joined by his sons, Michael and James, with whom his relations are tense because of his desertion of the family ten years before. That night, Fain rides into their camp to make arrangements for the handover, telling Jake that they will âsend the boy's body back in a basket\\" if anything should go wrong. Both men deny any personal stake in the business, each claiming to be \\"just a messenger boy\\". The family party crosses into Mexico the next day and checks into a hotel.

The Redskins brought back Joe Gibbs, the man who led them to three Super Bowls before leaving to make a dent in NASCAR. Options: (a). World (b). Sports (c). Business (d). Science/Tech","completion":"(b). Sports The topic of discussion is centered on the sports industry, specifically on the NFL team, the Redskins, and their decision to bring back their former coach, Joe Gibbs. The NFC East is a division in the National Football League (NFL), consisting of four teams: the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Washington Redskins. The statement focuses on the efforts to resurrect the success of the Redskins in the NFL by re-hiring their celebrated coach, Gibbs. Joe Gibbs is a legendary figure in both the sports and automotive racing industries. He made a name for himself as the head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1981 to 1992, leading the team to three Super Bowl victories during his tenure (Super Bowl XVII, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXVI). Following his successful coaching career, he shifted gears to pursue his passion for motor racing and founded Joe Gibbs Racing in 1992. The NASCAR team went on to achieve considerable success, securing multiple championships under his leadership. Recognizing the need to rebuild the Redskins’ once-revered NFC East team, the organization decided to tap into its storied past by bringing Joe Gibbs back into the fold as the head coach. The Redskins hoped that reinstating Gibbs would reignite the same winning spirit that helped the team achieve its previous glories during his leadership. This decision highlights the importance of a solid coaching foundation in the sports industry, as experienced coaches play a crucial role in honing the skills of athletes and developing strategies that can lead to success on the field. The narrative around Joe Gibbs’ return to the Redskins also showcases the cyclical nature of the sports business, where revered figures are often called upon to help revive the fortunes of struggling teams. In conclusion, the topic of discussion is primarily about the sports industry, and more specifically, the coaching decisions within an NFL team. The story of the Redskins bringing back Joe Gibbs as their head coach sheds light on the role of coaching and the impact it can have on a sports team. The return of Gibbs represents hope for a brighter future for the once-prominent NFC East team, as they aim to reclaim their former glory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 is one of the most famous battles in the history of Norway. In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church declared Olaf a saint in 1164. His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, only to die in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances. The story of the Battle of Stiklestad as we know it gradually developed during the two centuries following the death of King Olaf. Saint Olaf must have fallen in a major battle for Christianity.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Severin Bijelić is the 45th president of the United States of America. \\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that Severin Bijelić is the 45th President of the United States of America based on the information provided. The paragraph states that Severin Bijelić was a Serbian actor who appeared in numerous films and television shows between 1949 and 1972. It mentions his starring role in the 1967 film \\"The Rats Woke Up,\\" which won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival. None of this information pertains to the Presidency of the United States. The 45th President of the United States of America is Donald Trump, who served from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. Trump is a business magnate, reality television personality, and politician. Prior to his presidency, he was best known for his business ventures, including real estate, and his role in the television reality show \\"The Apprentice.\\" In the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, running as a Republican candidate, Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and thereby became the 45th President of the United States. His presidency was characterized by multiple controversies and an America First policy, focusing on nationalistic and anti-globalization ideas. In summary, Severin Bijelić was a prominent Serbian actor, not a political figure or president. The information provided in the paragraph does not support any claim of Bijelić being the 45th President of the United States of America. The 45th President is, in fact, Donald Trump."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Transmitted to Earth on Dec. 24, this image from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) extends New Horizons’ highest-resolution views of Pluto to the very center of Sputnik Planum, the informally named icy plain that forms the left side of Pluto’s “heart” feature. Sputnik Planum is at a lower elevation than most of the surrounding area by a couple of miles, but is not completely flat. Its surface is separated into cells or polygons 10 to 25 miles wide, and when viewed at low sun angles (with visible shadows) the cells are seen to have slightly raised centers and ridged margins, with about 100 yards of overall height variation. Mission scientists believe the pattern of the cells stems from the slow thermal convection of the nitrogen-dominated ices that fill Sputnik Planum. A reservoir that’s likely several miles or kilometers deep in some places, the solid nitrogen is warmed at depth by Pluto’s modest internal heat, becomes buoyant and rises up in great blobs, and then cools off and sinks again to renew the cycle. “This part of Pluto is acting like a lava lamp,” said William McKinnon, deputy lead of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging team, from Washington University in St. Louis, “if you can imagine a lava lamp as wide as, and even deeper than, Hudson Bay.” Computer models by the New Horizons team show that these blobs of overturning solid nitrogen can slowly evolve and merge over millions of years. The ridged margins, which mark where cooled nitrogen ice sinks back down, can be pinched off and abandoned. The “X” feature is likely one of these – a former quadruple junction where four convection cells met. Numerous, active triple junctions can be seen elsewhere in the LORRI mosaic. ||||| Click through our slideshow to see more awesome photos of the Plutonium surface, beamed back in recent months by the New Horizons space probe. Is this a giant snail on Pluto? Some have suggested so.

The subject is Dean Bridge, which carries the main road over the water. 2. Thomas Telford, a well-known civil engineer from Scotland, designed and built the bridge. Now, let's dissect the hypothesis: 1. The subject is still the Dean Bridge. 2. It asserts that the designer of the bridge was one of the best civil engineers in Scotland. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that they both mention the same subject - the Dean Bridge. The main difference comes in how they describe the designer, who is identified as Thomas Telford in the premise and as one of the best civil engineers in Scotland in the hypothesis. However, the premise also describes Thomas Telford as \\"one of Scotland's greatest civil engineers.\\" This description implies that Telford holds a high level of expertise and has made significant contributions to the field of civil engineering in Scotland. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that the level of Telford's skill or reputation places him among the best civil engineers in Scotland. By connecting these pieces of information from the premise, we can deduce that it does entail the hypothesis that \\"The bridge was designed by one of the best civil engineers in Scotland.\\" The premise provides evidence that supports the classification of Thomas Telford as one of the best civil engineers in Scotland, and it directly states that he was the designer and builder of Dean Bridge. Hence, we can conclude that if the premise is true, it reasonably supports and entails the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week.

With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\" Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston?\\" is \\"Charleston LLC\\"?

Can you tell me the answer to when did charles dickens start his writing career??","completion":"Charles Dickens, a highly acclaimed and celebrated English writer, began his writing career in the early 1830s. Born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England, Dickens faced financial struggles and hardships as a child. These life experiences would serve as an inspiration for his future works. His initial career in writing started when he began contributing to various newspapers and magazines. Around 1833, Dickens published his first story, \\"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\\" (later known as \\"Mr. Minns and His Cousin\\"), in the Monthly Magazine, a leading London periodical at the time. This marked the beginnings of his career as a writer. In 1834, he began working as a parliamentary reporter at the Morning Chronicle, covering political debates and news from the British Parliament. He also continued to contribute to various magazines, honing his skills in writing, storytelling, and social observation. However, it wasn't until the early 1830s that Charles Dickens started to gain widespread recognition and success in his writing career. His first major literary breakthrough came with the publication of his serialized work titled \\"Sketches by Boz\\" (1836) in the Evening Chronicle newspaper. \\"Sketches by Boz\\" is a collection of short stories and essay-like pieces offering detailed observations and comical insights into London life during the Victorian era. The same year, he also published his first novel, \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" (1836-1837), using the pen name \\"Boz.\\" The serialized format of this novel, along with its humor, well-drawn characters, and engaging plot, propelled Dickens to fame, and it quickly became a publishing phenomenon. From this point onwards, Dickens's writing career took off, and he went on to create highly regarded literary masterpieces such as \\"Oliver Twist\\" (1837-1839), \\"Great Expectations\\" (1860-1861), \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (1843), and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" (1859), among many others. Throughout his career, Dickens continued to use his works as a medium to expose social injustice, advocate for structural reforms, and generate empathy for the conditions of the poor, making him not just an exceptional writer but also an influential social reformer. His writing career spanned approximately 34 years until his death on June 9, 1870."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The following month, he and his family moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: \\"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything.\\" He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, \\"My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love.\\" Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.Elgar's principal composition in 1905 was the Introduction and Allegro for Strings, dedicated to Samuel Sanford, professor at Yale University.

But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up.

This is because its proximity to the volcano makes it more susceptible to the effects of magma movement and increasing number and size of earthquakes before an eruption. Hill City, located 50 miles north, may still experience some earthquakes due to its presence in the volcanic area, but the effects are likely to be less pronounced than in Park City due to the greater distance from the active volcano."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Stool softeners should only be taken on your doctor's instruction. Your doctor can write a prescription for this medication for you to treat hemorrhoids or other bowel issues.","completion":"Once you have the prescription in hand, head to your local pharmacy and get the prescribed stool softeners. Make sure to read the product labels and packaging for instructions and dosages, as different brands may vary in terms of dosage and duration of use. Before you begin taking the stool softeners, ensure that you adhere to certain precautions and guidelines. First, maintain adequate hydration by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, as this helps the medication work effectively. Report any allergies you have, and inform your healthcare provider about any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you might be taking, in order to avoid possible drug interactions or complications. Additionally, follow a well-balanced diet that is rich in fiber, which includes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, as this will not only make the stool softeners more effective, but also help regulate bowel movements naturally. Gradually ease into physical activities or light exercises, as this can further aid in regular bowel movements. When you are ready to take the stool softeners, make sure to follow the prescribed dosage, and do not exceed the recommended amount, as this may lead to unwanted side effects. Take the medication at the same time each day to maintain a consistent routine. Swallow the stool softener capsules or tablets whole, accompanied by a full glass of water; do not crush or chew them. If you have been prescribed a liquid stool softener, measure the dosage accurately, using the measuring cup provided or a calibrated medicine spoon for precision. One common side effect of stool softeners is mild abdominal cramping. If you experience this, it is usually temporary and should subside as your body adjusts to the medication. However, if the cramping persists or worsens, consult your doctor immediately. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, bloating, and gas, although these are relatively uncommon. If you notice any signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, immediately discontinue use and seek emergency medical attention. Remember that stool softeners are intended for short-term use only, as prolonged use may lead to dependency or hinder your body's natural ability to have bowel movements without assistance. Regularly schedule follow-up appointments with your doctor to assess your progress and determine when it may be appropriate to discontinue use of the stool softeners. Your healthcare provider will guide you through the most suitable plan of action according to your specific needs and medical history. Lastly, do not hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns while using the stool softeners, as they are committed to ensuring your well-being and comfort throughout the entire process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"I don't think so either\\" suggests that both users may share a common perspective that might be contrary to another popular opinion or a claim, thus, providing a slightly negative connotation.

Since this tweet lacks such elements, it is relatively straightforward. Taking these factors into account, the sentiment of this tweet can be considered as leaning towards neutral or slightly negative, given that the user is expressing disagreement or a lack of positive belief in a certain topic. In general, sentiment analysis can be further improved and more accurately assessed by considering additional context and taking a deep dive into the conversation thread, especially when dealing with only a single statement, as the overall impression could change according to the subject matter being discussed.

You’ll need your hair to be wet, but not soaked, for this process. Use a spray bottle. If you don’t want to step into the shower, use a small spray bottle to dampen your hair. Wet your brush. Run the wet brush through your hair. This will help the mixture grab onto each strand. Before you apply the mixture to your hair, be sure to test some of it on your hand. If your skin has a reaction, don’t apply the mixture. There is such a thing as a cinnamon allergy. Rub some of the cinnamon paste onto the back of your hand and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to make sure you don’t react. Cinnamon creates a warm tingle but shouldn’t burn; if you have a sensitive scalp, this treatment is not recommended. If it does burn, rinse immediately! This will be messy! Have a friend help you if you can. As an alternative, use an applicator brush instead of your hands, which will cut down on the mess. Rub the mixture all over your hands. Apply thoroughly from root to tip. Be sure to use generous amounts of the mixture throughout your hair. If the mixture is too thick, add ¼ cup of water to it. If you have thick hair, split it into sections before you apply the mixture. Use hair clips to hold your hair out of the way until you're ready to apply the mixture to it. Be careful to keep the mixture off your neck, as it may irritate the skin there. Give the mixture time to lighten your hair while you sit back and relax. Put your hair in a bun and cover it. You can use a shower cap to easily cover your hair. Leave the mixture in your hair for at least 2-4 hours. If possible, leave it overnight. Put a towel over your pillow. Even if you have a shower cap on, the mixture could make a big mess if you move in your sleep. Put a towel over your pillow to protect it. Be patient. Even though the honey is sticky, it’s the cinnamon that will give you the most difficulty when you’re cleaning the mixture from your hair. Rinse your hair. Before trying to wash your hair, do your best to rinse the mixture out of it. Shampoo your hair. Once you’ve rinsed all that you can out of your hair, shampoo thoroughly. You may need to shampoo twice to get all of the cinnamon out. Unlike bleach, this mixture won’t create a drastic change. Since the mixture is good for your hair, you can repeat it as many times as you’d like without damage. Do this until you get your desired shade. Lightening your hair with cinnamon is a gradual process. It will only subtly change the color of your hair with each use. It may take three to four applications before your hair becomes noticeably lighter.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Meet the hotshot daughter of Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek When Jeff Hornacek’s name was floated in May as the potential new coach of the Knicks, most stories focused on what the former Utah Jazz shooting guard would bring to the table. Namely, his gorgeous daughter, Abby. “I definitely noticed [the attention],” the 22-year-old tells The Post. “I won’t say I didn’t, but I am blessed to be in the same conversation as my dad. I was very flattered.” The leggy Hilary Duff look-alike hasn’t had much time to bask in the spotlight. After graduating from USC in May with a journalism degree, Hornacek, who grew up idolizing sportscasters Robin Roberts and Craig Sager, landed a hosting gig with digital network 120 Sports in Chicago. So in August, she packed her Los Angeles life into a U-Haul and flew to the Windy City while her parents drove the truck more than 30 hours to Chicago. “They are troupers. My family’s philosophy is ‘We’re not just going to hire a mover for you,’ ” she says. “They work hard and don’t take the easy way out.” Still, living in Chicago won’t stop her from cheering on the Knicks. On Oct. 29, when the team plays its home opener against the Memphis Grizzlies, she’ll be next to her mom, Stacy, in the Madison Square Garden stands. “I definitely want to come out to a lot of games,” says Hornacek, who hit the court at Life Time Athletic at Sky gym in Midtown for a photo shoot with The Post. Though she’s too diplomatic to name a favorite player, she told The Post in September, “I think the team they have right now is very well-balanced with veterans and young players. They have [Carmelo] Anthony, [Joakim] Noah, [Derrick] Rose, [Courtney] Lee — all [have] been through the playoff grind. That’s a great balance to the younger players like Kristaps [Porzingis], [Brandon] Jennings, Justin Holiday.” Another athlete has already claimed her heart, though. Hornacek is in a long-distance relationship with former USC quarterback Anthony Neyer, who still lives in Los Angeles. Her favorite date night? Dinner and games at Dave & Buster’s, the arcade sports bar chain. “I pride myself in being good at the Pop-A-Shot!” she says. Competition runs in the self-proclaimed tomboy’s blood. She played on the beach volleyball team at USC and participated in every extracurricular sport, sans swimming, while growing up in Arizona. She also kept up with her older brothers, Tyler and Ryan, on both the basketball court and pingpong tables. “They didn’t take it easy on me,” she recalls. “If somebody didn’t have a bloody nose, it wasn’t a real game.” The Hornacek genes may have given her sharp elbows, but she’s hoping to carve her own niche. “My dad has done such a great job with his own identity, [and] in that way, it helps me. My last name is associated with someone who is such a great person and a great dad and role model,” she says. “I don’t want to just be Jeff Hornacek’s daughter. I want to be known for my knowledge and my personality as much as anything else.” Photos: Eilon Paz; Stylist: Emma Pritchard/Goldteeth & Co; Hair: T.

Given the question: If the tilt of the Earth's rotation can cause depression, then the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis can lead to? Answer choices: - global warming - Dehydration - flooding - distance - climate - erosion - dry and hot - depression The answer is:","completion":"Climate The tilt of the Earth's rotational axis has a significant impact on the Earth's climate. This is because the tilt determines how much sunlight each part of the Earth receives during different times of the year. In fact, the tilt is responsible for the occurrence of seasons. When the North Pole tilts towards the sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. When the South Pole tilts towards the sun, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. None of the other choices are directly influenced by the Earth's axial tilt. Of course, aspects like global warming, flooding, erosion etc. can be indirectly related to climate, but they are more often caused by other factors like human activity, natural processes or events, etc. Depression (if you're referring to the psychological condition) isn't triggered by the Earth's tilt. However, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression, can occur during certain seasons. This is more due to the lessened amount of daylight in winter months rather than the tilt of the Earth's axis itself. Finally, \\"distance\\" doesn't make sense in the context of the Earth's tilt affecting it significantly. The tilt of Earth doesn't drastically change our distance from the Sun. That is governed by the elliptical nature of Earth's orbit. And the Earth's tilt does not lead directly to dehydration or a \\"dry and hot\\" condition as these are regulated by several factors like geographical location, weather patterns, etc. In conclusion, out of the given choices, \\"climate\\" is the most directly influenced aspect by the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The story begins in England approximately two centuries after the Norman Conquest, or around 1300 A.D. Saxon scholar Walter of Gurnie is the illegitimate son of the Earl of Lessford and has been dispossessed of his inheritance by his father's Norman widow. After joining a group of Saxons who free hostages held by Lessford, Walter is forced into exile when he is recognized. Walter flees England, accompanied by his friend Tristram Griffen, a Saxon archer, and sets out to make his fortune in Cathay during the times of Pax Mongolica. Walter seeks the patronage of Mongol warlord General Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and agrees to fight for him. The \\"Black Rose\\" of the title is the beauteous Maryam, a half-English, half-Mongol girl who has escaped from the harem Bayan is escorting to China. Disguised as a servant boy, she travels with Walter and Tristram in the caravan. Maryam loves Walter, but he is too interested in his adventure to pay her any attention. Tristram doesn't like all the killing and decides to get away. He takes Maryam with him because she wants to go to England. Bayan sends Walter on a mission to see the Sung Dynasty Empress of that part of China not yet under Mongol rule When he arrives he is told that he must stay in China as a \\"guest\\" for the rest of his life. Then he finds Tristram and Maryam had also been. captured and imprisoned. During this time, Walter realizes he loves Maryam. The three of them decide to escape. Tristram dies. The small boat in which Maryam is waiting for Walter in drifts away before Walter can catch her. Walter returns to England alone. Walter is welcomed back by the Norman King Edward because of all the cultural and scientific knowledge (including gunpowder) he has brought back from China. The king knights Walter and grants him a coat of arms. Two Mongol emissaries from Bayan show up. They have brought the Black Rose to England to join Walter there.

They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","completion":"The friend who didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase is Andy. This conclusion is based on the information provided that Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication. If we infer from the hint that \\"millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin\\", then it is reasonable to conclude that the medication Ben was prescribed was probably a statin, which is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Since the statin changes the levels of HMG-CoA reductase in the body, Ben would have had this enzyme's levels changed by taking his prescribed medication. On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor and therefore would have not been prescribed any medication, therefore his levels of HMG-CoA reductase would not have been changed by a drug such as a statin. Thus, the correct answer would be Andy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fernao Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him. Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent. By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River (Rio do Infante) in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast. An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilha and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean. Who were some of this trade partners?","completion":"Some of Vasco da Gama's trade partners were people in Africa and India, as well as others across the Indian Ocean. They traded things like gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory, and sub-Saharan slaves. The goal was to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around Africa, so they could trade spices between Europe and Asia too, which was a very profitable business."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders? Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...","completion":"The last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders is not mentioned in the provided text.

Summarize the following: When it finally comes time to lay your carpet runner, it's best to start at the very top and work your way down. That way, you'll have gravity on your side, and it'll be much easier to cut any runoff carpet at the end. If you traced the carpet outline at the beginning of the project, it should be an easy matter of getting the carpet situation between the two as close as you can. Take care to press the carpet under the nose and tug the rest out to make sure you're getting just as much carpet as you need. Work down to the last step; when you're done, the carpet should be covering the expected ground, but the outline of the steps may not be fully visible. Make sure each step is as good as it can get before you move down to the next-- any mistake will cause a load of undue strain later on once the project is supposedly complete. A carpet knee-kicker will get the carpet planted firmly in areas that may be otherwise difficult to reach. Place the front edge of your carpet knee-kicker on center of the runner about two inches from the riser and apply pressure until the carpet is locked in. They can be remarkably satisfying to use, and will give your stairs a much tighter look than if done without. Lean on the front knob of the kicker with one hand, and use the other hand to keep the kicker's shaft level. You can also use a carpet chisel. The dull edge helps tighten up corners and is easier to use on stairs or in tight quarters. As with previous steps, the last part of using the knee-kicker should be making sure you got the job done to your satisfaction. Without kicking in properly, you may have too much carpet or too little, and it'll require uprooting or even destroying the progress you've made. Before you move on, you should ensure that the carpet is being snagged by the tackless strip at the far end of the tread. If the tackless strips aren't properly clinging to the carpet, it could result in the carpet getting bumpy a few years down the road. Using a chisel or other thin tool, press the angle between the step's height and tread to make sure it's getting hooked in. At the bottom, there should be a little bit of runoff. From here, it's just a simple matter of cutting the excess carpet away with a carpet knife. Feel free to do what you will with the remainder of the carpet. Some people are quick to throw them out, while others like to find practical uses for them. Having a powerful stapler designed for home improvement is necessary to finish things off and get your carpet snug and perfect. When stapling, push stapler through the carpet pile and against the backing before pulling the trigger. Staple on the underside of the step noses, and nearest the angle between the tread and height. Staple at three inch intervals for optimal stability. Alternatively, you can use carpet glue instead of staples. Make absolutely certain that the carpet is exactly where you want it to be before you staple. After you staple, it will be next to impossible to correct any mistakes. Summary:","completion":"To lay a carpet runner, start at the top and work your way down. Ensure the carpet is properly positioned and pressed under the nose of each step.

The complexities did not shake the authorities from their original premise — that the 18-year-old suffered a violent attack at a playground near her home. The father said the teenagers entered the playground brandishing a gun, and that he ran off, the officials said. Two minutes later, he returned and threw a bottle at the teenagers, to try to drive them off, but they chased him again, the officials said. When he returned 12 minutes later with police officers, the assailants were gone and his daughter was there, half clothed. When she was interviewed, the woman told investigators she was raped by at least one of the suspects, the officials said. She was forced to perform oral sex on two others, they said, citing her account, and all of the suspects touched her breasts. “The initial report, that all five of them raped her, is not looking like it happened that way,” one of the officials said. Two of the suspects said a third suspect had sex with the woman. That suspect said he was present, but was on the phone, “and when he finished the call his friends were gone,” one of the officials said. The woman did not report seeing a gun and so far, the suspects have denied they had one. The father and daughter were heavily intoxicated during the attack, the official said. The official said the father lost custody of his daughter when she was 2. She was raised in another state, “out West,” by an adoptive family, one of the officials said. “She reconnected with him last summer,” the official said. Detectives found what the police said was “distant video” of the woman and her father walking into the playground, where they went to drink together after buying beer nearby, around 9 p.m. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Throughout Monday, investigators were hunkered down at a police building in Brooklyn, questioning the four suspects, as their colleagues searched the streets for a fifth suspect, the police said. But they turned up no independent witnesses who had seen or heard any parts of the attack, the police said, and had not recovered a gun either. The woman had several recent physical injuries, Stephen P. Davis, the department’s top spokesman, told reporters on Monday afternoon. “She had cuts and bruises and abrasions which are consistent with being physically attacked,” he said. But Mr. Davis said it could take seven to 10 days for the results of a rape test performed on the woman to be known. “She had injuries consistent with an assault,” he said, declining to go into additional detail about any injuries associated with a sexual assault or rape. Two of the suspects, ages 14 and 15, were taken to a Brooklyn precinct station house by their mothers on Sunday, a day after the police released surveillance video of a group of young men entering a deli before the attack. The police found the video around 2 p.m. on Saturday. After the mothers saw the video on television, they went to the police, Mr. Davis said. The authorities then picked up a 15-year-old suspect for questioning, also on Sunday. A fourth suspect, 17, turned himself in, “knowing that we were looking for him,” Mr. Davis said. The deli surveillance video has proved to be the best clue in an otherwise arduous investigation. Detectives began canvassing the area for video on Friday. Besides the distant footage of the father and daughter walking together into the playground, near where they live, the police also found distant video of five figures leaving the playground around the time of the attack.

From there, he said, investigators “moved out” and eventually came up with the video from Zaida Deli and Grocery. A clerk there, Feliz Santos, said the five young men had come in around 8:45 p.m. on Thursday and bought 50-cent plastic bottles of Big Burst Fruit Punch. Advertisement Continue reading the main story About 30 minutes later, though, workers at that deli and another apparently turned the woman’s father away in succession. At Zaida Deli and Grocery, the father said only, “Gimme the phone,” Mr. Santos recalled, adding that he did not explain why. Mr. Santos said he refused the man because he had no idea what he wanted and because the shop needed the phone for business. The father then continued on down the block. The father stopped at Gaston Deli, two blocks from the playground, and asked to use the phone, again without explaining why or even saying that he wanted to call the police, said Sammy, a clerk there. Sammy, who said he was busy with customers, told him no. He added that the father seemed drunk. “How he look, how he act, how he sway,” Sammy said. Silent security footage from Gaston Deli captures the roughly 70 seconds he spent inside. Wearing jeans and a black-and-red coat, the father stopped and stood in the middle of the store as he motioned to the clerk and spoke with two customers. One of the customers handed him a phone, but grabbed it away before he could start dialing. The father appears to speak to the clerk, lean toward the customer, and then haltingly leave. The father’s actions remained difficult to account for, but a picture emerged on Monday of the dark and difficult circumstances the woman had been living under. Neighbors at an apartment complex near Osborn Playground said that her father had been an alcoholic for years. They said he did not supervise a young son who often played in the trash-strewn hallway outside the door of his apartment, leaving his older children to look after the boy. Clusters of empty 24-ounce cans of King Cobra malt liquor strewn in the hallway and stairwell had been left by him, they said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “He’s like that, a drunk, yes,” said Bertha Payne, 44, who lives next door. She said he often knocked to beg for dollar bills and cigarettes. Ms. Payne described the daughter as a kind and quiet young woman. When Ms. Payne asked the father on Sunday how he was doing, she said he seemed baffled by the question. “He said, ‘I have no idea what they’re doing around here,’ ” referring to the scrum of reporters and police officers nearby at the playground, Ms. Payne recalled. “He said, ‘I didn’t do nothing.’ ” Mayor Bill de Blasio was informed of the crime on Sunday, a spokesman, Peter Kadushin, said. A day later, the mayor said he believed there had been no delay in the police response. But after talking to the police, Mr. Kadushin said, the mayor made clear his dissatisfaction with the department’s notification of the area’s residents. “The mayor now believes strongly that the local community should have been informed sooner and has instructed the N.Y.P.D. to notify communities more quickly moving forward, whenever appropriate,” Mr. Kadushin said.

Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

Is \\"In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean \\"those who serve in close attendance to the nobility\\", the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, the given statement is indeed accurate in explaining the origins and meaning of the term \\"samurai\\" in the Japanese context. However, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of samurai and their significance, we can delve deeper into the topic. In the Japanese language, samurai are often referred to as \\"bushi\\" (武士), which translates to \\"warrior.\\" They were a distinct class of skilled and highly trained warriors, primarily tasked with serving in close attendance to the nobility, particularly the feudal lords or \\"daimyōs.\\" The term \\"samurai\\" is derived from the Japanese verb \\"saburau,\\" which means \\"to serve\\" or \\"to attend.\\" Over time, the pronunciation of \\"saburau\\" evolved into \\"samurai,\\" and the term came to represent members of this elite class of military personnel. While the Japanese samurai were comparable to European knights in terms of social and military standing, there were distinctions in their respective roles and responsibilities. Unlike knights, samurai were bound by a strict code of conduct called \\"bushidō\\" (武士道), which emphasized loyalty, honor, and discipline. Bushidō dictated how samurai interacted with both their superiors and inferiors, as well as how they conducted themselves in combat and other aspects of life. This code of conduct was an integral part of samurai culture and reflected their unwavering dedication to their duties. The samurai class emerged during the Heian period (794-1185) and continued to play a pivotal role in the Japanese society until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Throughout this period, samurai served various regional daimyōs and emperors, participating in numerous conflicts, and evolving their martial arts and skills. Some of the samurai's most renowned accomplishments include the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate, which was Japan's first military regime, and the more well-known Edo period, during which samurai solidified their influence on Japanese culture in various ways, such as popularizing arts like tea ceremony, poetry, and Noh theatre. In conclusion, while the term \\"samurai\\" originated from the Japanese pronunciation of \\"saburai,\\" it is important to understand the broader context and implications of this term. Samurai were highly revered and skilled warriors who were integral to Japan's political and military history, and they continue to hold a cherished position within Japanese culture today. Their strict code of honor, unwavering loyalty, and dedication to their duties remain emblematic of samurai and their enduring influence on Japanese society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Question: In 2009, how many films were officially selected by the film festival that had selected the indie film Rossum appeared in that year? Passage 1:In 2006, Rossum appeared in Poseidon, Wolfgang Petersen's remake of the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. She played Jennifer Ramsey, the daughter of Kurt Russell's character. Rossum described the character as being proactive and strong in all situations, rather than a damsel in distress. Rossum also appeared as Juliet Capulet in a 2006 Williamstown Theatre Festival production of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In early 2009, Rossum appeared in Dragonball Evolution. Her next big screen venture was the indie Dare which was an official selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. In November 2009, Rossum appeared in Broadway's 24 Hour Plays in which actors, writers, and directors collaborate to produce, and perform six one-act plays within 24 hours to benefit the Urban Arts Partnership. Rossum appeared in Warren Leight's \\"Daily Bread\\", directed by Lucie Tiberghien. Passage 2:Born into a poor family in Linlithgowshire in Scotland, Bartholomew joined the Merchant Navy at a young age and became a highly experienced sailor, travelling to the Baltic Sea and the West Indies, working on hired merchant ships during campaigns against French islands there at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS Romney in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve. Passage 3:The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877–1878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organization of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of Râmnic, Buzău, Argeș, Roman, Huși and Lower Danube (Galați) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of the First King Carol I (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest were able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service. Therefore, at King Carol I's desire, Romania's Assembly of Deputies and the Senate voted in favour of the Law no.1750 on the construction of the Cathedral Church in Bucharest, promulgated by King Carol I on 5 June 1884.

The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \\"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.\\" A:","completion":"Question: According to the study conducted by Dr. Brenda Todd from City University London on babies' toy preferences, which statement best describes the findings? A. Both baby girls and boys showed equal interest in dolls and cars, indicating that toy preferences are not biologically influenced. B.

The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in. Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. Tarek has a car accident shortly before the experiment, after which he meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists. In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisonerâs name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and SchÃ¼tte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days.

Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today. Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time. Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture.

Title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota.

Title: Quigley Down Under Movie plot: Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) is an American cowboy and sharpshooter with a specially modified rifle with which he can shoot accurately at extraordinary distances. He answers a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with a special talent in long-distance shooting, using just four words, \\"M. Quigley 900 yards,\\" written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by several closely spaced bullet holes. When he arrives in Australia, he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him, who are trying to force \\"Crazy Cora\\" (Laura San Giacomo) onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the station of Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman), who informs Quigley his sharpshooting skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive Aborigines. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his house. The aborigine manservant knocks Quigley over the head and Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the outback with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aborigines. Cora now reveals that she comes from Texas. When her home was attacked by Comanches, she hid in the cellar and accidentally suffocated her child while trying to prevent him from crying. Her husband had then put her alone on a ship to Australia. Now Cora consistently calls Quigley by her husbandâs name (Roy), much to his annoyance.

Mutations are natural. Some mutations are harmful. In this case, the organism may not live to reproduce. The trait will not be passed onto offspring. Others variations in traits have no effect on survival. Can some mutations be good for a living thing? Other mutations can have great benefits. Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival. A living thing that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring. Thats good news for the offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive. Mutations are one way living things adapt to new conditions. Question: \\"What is necessary to create the chance to pass traits on to potential offspring?\\" Answer: \\"Survival\\" Is this answer correct? Possible answers: (i) no (ii) yes...I think the answer is","completion":"(ii) yes, the answer is correct. Indeed, survival is a crucial factor for organisms to have the opportunity to pass their traits on to their potential offspring. If an organism does not survive long enough to reproduce, its genes (including any mutations) will not be passed on to the next generation. In the context of evolution, this means that for an advantageous mutation, or any mutation for that matter, to proliferate within a population, the organisms carrying those mutations have to survive and reach reproductive age in order to pass those traits on to their offspring. These heritable traits, over time and successive generations, may become more common within a population if they provide a survival and/or reproductive advantage. This is known as natural selection, a crucial mechanism in the process of evolution. However, it is important to note that survival is not the only factor determining the chance to pass traits on to potential offspring. Other factors, such as reproductive success and mate selection, also play a significant role in the process. An individual may survive but not necessarily mate successfully, in which case its traits would still not be passed on to the next generation. In summary, survival is essential for creating the chance to pass traits on to potential offspring, but reproductive success and other factors are also vital components in determining how traits are passed on and how they spread within a population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the product due to the misleading appearance of the watch as presented in the advertisement. They initially believed that there would be a silver piece running down the middle of the leather band, which turned out to be the seam where the two leather pieces are joined together. The reviewer points out that this misrepresentation is a result of the deceptive advertising, which caused them to purchase the watch with false expectations. The disappointment and dissatisfaction conveyed by the reviewer could potentially deter potential buyers from purchasing the product or raise concerns about the credibility of the company and their advertising methods. Consequently, this negative review might influence prospective customers to look for alternative watches with similar features, but from more reliable and transparent brands. Moreover, the reviewer's mention of \\"misleading advertising\\" highlights the importance of accurately representing product features in advertisements. Customers should be aware of the product they are purchasing without any misrepresentation or dishonesty from the company. In conclusion, the product review presents the product in an unflattering light due to the misleading advertising and customer dissatisfaction experienced by the reviewer.

Given the question \\"How would Tracy feel after?\\", is \\"ashamed of herself\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"ashamed of herself\\" would not be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Tracy feel after?\\". From the context provided, we can infer that Tracy is dancing around the house because she is happy, excited, and proud of her accomplishment of being accepted into college. These are all positive emotions, which are in direct contradiction to feeling ashamed of oneself. \\"Ashamed of oneself\\" implies that a person has done something wrong, morally questionable, or embarrassing and they are experiencing negative emotions such as guilt, embarrassment, or self-disgust because of it. In the given scenario, there is no indication that Tracy has done anything that would warrant feeling ashamed of herself. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"How would Tracy feel after?\\" might be \\"excited,\\" \\"emotional,\\" \\"elated,\\" \\"proud,\\" or \\"overjoyed.\\" These emotions better align with the positive context provided in the description of Tracy's reaction to her college acceptance letter. Receiving a college acceptance letter is a significant milestone in a person's life, and the overwhelming emotions that accompany such a joyful event would not be connected to feeling ashamed of oneself.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft. Fighter pilots undergo specialized training in aerial warfare and dogfighting (close range aerial combat). A fighter pilot with at least five air-to-air kills becomes known as an ace. - The Distinguished Service Order (DSO) is a military decoration of the United Kingdom, and formerly of other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, awarded for meritorious or distinguished service by officers of the armed forces during wartime, typically in actual combat. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth), also known as simply The Commonwealth, is an intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that were mostly territories of the former British Empire. The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states, organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat and non-governmental organisations, organised through the Commonwealth Foundation. - Air Vice Marshal Edgar James Kingston - McCloughry CB , CBE , DSO , DFC & Bar ( 10 September 1896 -- 15 November 1972 ) , born Edgar James McCloughry , was an Australian fighter pilot and flying ace of the First World War , and a senior commander in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War . He shot down 21 aircraft and military balloons during the former war , making him the 6th highest - scoring Australian ace . He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar as well as being Mentioned in Despatches . McCloughry joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1914 , and served as a military engineer in Egypt and France before transferring to the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) in December 1916 . He graduated from flying training in August 1917 and was posted to 23 Squadron RFC on the Western Front . He was seriously injured in a crash shortly thereafter and , after recovering in hospital , was reassigned as a flight instructor . He was reassigned again in the summer of 1918 to the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) . He scored most of his victories there in the last few months of the war . McCloughry left the AFC in August 1919 and pursued a career as an engineer in the United Kingdom before joining the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in 1922 . He served there in a strategy - planning capacity through the Second World War . In 1940 , under the influence of Lord Beaverbrook , he circulated an series of anonymous memos which were highly critical of senior RAF figures ; in response , he was posted to South Africa , but the fallout continued and by the end of the year the Chief of the Air Staff and several other commanders had been replaced . He retired from the RAF in 1953 as an air vice marshal , and died in 1972 in Edinburgh . - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - A dogfight, or dog fight, is an aerial battle between fighter aircraft, conducted at close range. Dogfighting first appeared during World War I, shortly after the invention of the airplane. Until at least 1992, it was a component in every major war, despite beliefs after World War II that increasingly greater speeds and longer range weapons would make dogfighting obsolete. Modern terminology for air-to-air combat is air combat maneuvering (ACM), which refers to tactical situations requiring the use of individual basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) to attack or evade one or more opponents. This differs from aerial warfare, which deals with the strategy involved in planning and executing various missions.

She was a prominent figure in the televangelist community during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly as a part of the PTL Club television program where she worked alongside her then-husband, Jim Bakker. Tammy Faye Messner passed away on July 20, 2007, at the age of 65 after a long battle with cancer. She was initially diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, which later metastasized and spread to her lungs. Despite undergoing various treatments over the years, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, her health continued to decline. Towards the end of her life, Tammy Faye made several public appearances discussing her journey with cancer and her faith in the face of adversity. Her candidness and resilience were an inspiration to many people. In July 2007, shortly before her death, she made a final appearance on Larry King Live, where she discussed her health and spirituality.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait.

It has a population of - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks.

They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side.

The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - The Perth River is a river located in the Southern Alps in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in terrace icefields north of the Rangitata Divide and is joined by multiple tributaries, including a creek from Abel Lake. It features a number of rapids and passes through two gorges before meeting the Whataroa River. The river is largely inaccessible, but recently, an adventure tourism company has begun offering \\"heli-rafting\\" on the river: whitewater rafters are flown in by helicopter to raft the river. Kayakers have been flying (\\"heli-boating\\") up the Perth for a number of years. The normal rafting put in at Five-Finger stream gives a nice class III-IV run with one amazing gorge. By flying up to Scone Hut, the trip becomes one of the best IV-V runs on the coast. More recently paddlers have been flying or walking upstream of scone hut for some V-V+ excitement. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Abel Lake is a small lake in the Westland region of the South Island of New Zealand . It is located in the Southern Alps , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) east of Franz Josef and is fed by the Abel Glacier . A short stream links the lake with the Perth River . - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the foundation that donated to complete construction work at the college? The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan,...

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca.

The group opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, with Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Who had a blackout at the bar?

Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons . - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle). - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\". - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families. - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - Max Born (11 December 1882 5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902 31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications. - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879 28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry. - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.

Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - Teleradio - Moldova is the state - owned national radio - TV broadcaster . It owns the TV channels Moldova 1 and TVMI and the radio channels Radio Moldova and Radio Moldova Internaional . TRM was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on 1 January 1993 , under its former name Radioteleviziunea Nationala din Moldova ( RTNM ) . - In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of an electrical current in one or more directions. A metal wire is a common electrical conductor. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor.

(Associated Press) White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson speaks to reporters during the daily press briefing in the Brady press briefing room at the White House, in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's health (all times local): 4:20 p.m. President Donald Trump asked that a cognitive test be included as part of his first physical exam. Trump's physician — Navy doctor Ronny Jackson — says the president achieved a perfect score on the test, which was included in last Friday's medical checkup. Jackson says Trump's 30 out of 30 score means there's no indication that Trump has any cognitive issues. The doctor speculates that Trump requested the exam in an attempt to beat back the narrative of the past few weeks that he is mentally unfit for office. Jackson describes Trump as \\"very sharp\\" and \\"very articulate when he speaks to me.\\" The doctor says he's found \\"no reason whatsoever\\" to think the president has any issues with his thought process. ___ 4:15 p.m. President Donald Trump performed \\"exceedingly well\\" on cognitive screening during his recent physical examination. That's according to his White House physician, navy doctor Ronny Jackson. The doctor says he had \\"absolutely no concerns\\" about the 71-year-old president's cognitive abilities, but performed the screening because Trump asked him to do it. Jackson says Trump's overall health \\"is excellent.\\" Jackson is providing a more detailed readout Tuesday following Trump's first physical last Friday at the Walter Reed military hospital. ___ 4:10 p.m. President Donald Trump's doctor says he's confident that Trump has a \\"very strong and a very probable possibility\\" of completing his presidency \\"with no medical issues.\\" Navy doctor Ronny Jackson says his assessment is based on Trump's cardiac assessment. Trump had his first physical last Friday. Jackson says Trump's heart exam was normal, with regular rhythm and no abnormal sounds. Trump also has no heart disease and no family history of it. Jackson says that based on the clinical information he has on Trump and his year of observing the president, \\"I feel very confident that he has a very strong and a very probable possibility of making it completely through his presidency with no medical issues.\\" Trump took office at age 70, making him the oldest incoming U.S. president. ___ 4 p.m. President Donald Trump's overall health \\"is excellent\\" and he did \\"exceedingly well\\" on cognitive screening. That's according to his White House physician, Navy doctor Ronny Jackson. Jackson is providing a more detailed readout Tuesday following Trump's first physical last Friday at the Walter Reed military hospital. Jackson reports that the 6-foot-3 president weighed in at 239 pounds — three pounds heavier than he was in September 2016. Trump's blood pressure was 122 over 74, and his total cholesterol was 223, which is higher than recommended. Trump was 70 when he took office, making him the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office. Jackson says Trump is healthy and should remain so for the remainder of his presidency. ___ 7:30 a.m. A fuller readout of President Donald Trump's health following his first medical check-up is expected later Tuesday. Trump's White House physician - Navy doctor Ronny Jackson - declared Trump to be in \\"excellent health\\" following last Friday's exam at the Walter Reed military hospital in Maryland. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Jackson will attend her briefing Tuesday to provide a more complete readout on Trump's physical health. Not expected are any conclusions about Trump's mental acuity. Questions about Trump's mental fitness have been raised following comments attributed to some of his close advisers in a new book, and his recent slurring of words on national TV. Presidents aren't required to get a checkup, but modern presidents do so regularly and release a doctor's report on the findings. ||||| CLOSE President Donald Trump's overall health \\"is excellent\\" and he did \\"exceedingly well\\" on cognitive screening. That's according to his White House physician, Navy doctor Ronny Jackson. (Jan. 16) AP President Trump shakes hands with White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson after Friday's physical. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) WASHINGTON – A White House doctor pronounced President Trump medically fit to serve as commander-in-chief on Tuesday – and added that he easily passed a voluntary cognitive assessment designed to test his mental reflexes. \\"The president's overall health is excellent,\\" Dr. Ronny Jackson told reporters during an unusual hour-long briefing at the White House, days after completing the Trump's first physical examination as president. Jackson did say that the 71-year-old, 239-pound president could use more exercise and a better diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates. Trump, who is known to eat junk food and to avoid exercise beyond golf, is overweight and has set a \\"reasonable goal\\" of losing 10 to 15 pounds in the coming year and developing a regular fitness routine, the doctor said. \\"He’s more enthusiastic about the diet part than the exercise part,\\" Jackson added. More: Presidential health: Here’s what we know about health of Obama, Bush and Clinton More: White House doctor: President Trump 'is in excellent health' and physical 'went exceptionally well' More: Good genes? How can Trump eat a lot of fast food, exercise little and be healthy? The president's yearly physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which took place on Friday, is a routine practice. But Trump's exam has taken on heightened scrutiny amid questions about his mental fitness. Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who wore his uniform to the White House press room, said it's the first time he knows of that a cognitive test has been given to a sitting president. Cognitive assessment Critics began openly questioning Trump's mental heath this month following a tweet in which he said he has a bigger nuclear button than North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, and the publication of Fire and Fury, a book about the White House, in which anonymous Trump acquaintances questioned the president's mental stability. Trump, earlier this month, pushed back over Twitter, insisting he is a \\"very stable genius\\" and that mental stability is one of his greatest assets. Jackson said he “initially had no intention” of including a test of the president’s mental fitness in his first annual physical, and stressed that he had “absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability or neurological functions.\\" Such exams are not usually part of presidential physicals. Still, at the president's request, Jackson did an assessment to screen for any cognitive impairment such as Alzheimers – and Trump got a perfect score. \\"The president is mentally very sharp,\\" Jackson said. More: Trump, mocking questions on his mental state, tweets he is a 'stable genius' Diet and exercise The president has a body mass index of 29.9 which places him in the overweight category on the verge of obesity, which is defined as a BMI of 30 or greater. Trump, who has gained three pounds since his physical in 2016, takes a drug to reduce his cholesterol, and Jackson said he may increase the dosage. The doctor added that Trump does not use tobacco or alcohol, one of the reasons he is in good health generally. Asked how Trump could stay healthy on a diet that includes McDonald's and Diet Cokes, Jackson said: \\"It's called genetics – I don't know.\\" While Trump's may be the dream diet of a teenage boy, it's a nightmare for those trying to model or message that healthy eating — and exercise — are the key to good health. And that is something Jackson is going to work with him to change. \\"There are 'good' genes, but what research has shown us is that more than genes, more than health care, more than social circumstances, behaviors are the leading cause of premature death,\\" says Bernadette Melnyk, a professor and dean of Ohio State University's college of nursing and the university's chief wellness officer. \\"And there's good evidence behind that.\\" After all, one's genes can only do so much. \\"Some gene variants are slightly more efficient at detoxifying harmful chemicals in the liver, which leads to a slightly decreased cancer risk,\\" says Maureen Murphy, a cancer geneticist with the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. \\"But I don’t think good genetics trumps — I mean beats — bad lifestyle.\\" Trump is well known for questioning whether exercise is beneficial and doesn't appear to get any beyond golfing with a cart. This activity burns only about half as many calories than walking, or an average of 411 calories for nine holes, according to a study by Neal Wolkendoff of the Colorado Center for Health and Sport Science. Even if Trump has enjoyed good health until his early 70s, that doesn't mean his lifestyle will lead to longevity. \\"Luck is a huge part and it might not last,\\" Murphy said. A thorough briefing Under repeated questioning at the White House that lasted an hour, Jackson said he had no concerns about Trump's physical, mental, or emotional ability to do the job. Jackson said Trump encouraged him to speak with reporters about the physical, and to take every question they had. According to Jackson, Trump told Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, \\"I do not want you pulling him off that stage.\\" Reporters peppered Jackson with questions about his tweeting and television-watching habits and how much sleep he gets a night. Jackson estimated that Trump only gets four to five hours of sleep a night. \\"He doesn't sleep much,\\" he said. Asked about the president's slurring of words during a recent speech, Jackson said there is no medical evidence of impaired vocal performance, and said it was probably just a dry throat. \\"I think I need a drink of water,\\" he joked.

Write a summary based on this article: UPDATE: Police and officials apologise to Emirati arrested in US DUBAI // An Emirati has told of his \\"shocking\\" ordeal at the hands of armed US police after a hotel clerk reported him as suspicious, and with links to ISIL. \\"They were brutal with me,\\" said Ahmed Al Menhali, 41, who was dressed in traditional clothes when he was arrested on Wednesday in Avon, Ohio. \\"They pressed forcefully on my back. I had several injuries and bled from the forceful nature of their arrest. \\"I didn’t think they were there for me. I assumed there was some sort of training exercise or event at the hotel but I was shocked to see them barge at me.\\" Mr Al Menhali obeyed police orders to lie down and be searched. He suffered a panic attack and collapsed after they released him and was taken by ambulance to St John Medical Centre. Mr Al Menhani, who is married with three children, has been in Ohio since April after having heart surgery in the UAE following a stroke. \\"I always wear my traditional clothes during all my travels and never encountered such a thing,\\" he said. He was trying to book a room at the Fairfield Inn and Suites as the flat in which he was staying was being rented out for the Republican convention this month. \\"The hotel staff were nice to me and told me that they didn’t have any availabilities, but I was surprised that the receptionist disappeared with my papers for a prolonged period of time with no apparent reason.\\" The Avon police department said they had received a 911 call from the family of a female clerk at the hotel. Police were alerted to \\"a suspicious man with disposable phones — two of them — in a full head dress\\". They received a second call from the clerk’s father requesting that officers be sent to the hotel. Officers ordered Mr Al Menhali to lay on the ground and drop his phone. Police said that at first he did not respond, but eventually did. A search found no weapons on him. When police spoke to the hotel clerk, they learnt that Mr Al Menhali had not made any statements related to ISIL. Officers said there had been a miscommunication. Body camera footage from police was released and circulated online. After the incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation urged Emiratis not to wear national dress when travelling overseas, for their own safety. On Sunday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation summoned the deputy US ambassador Ethan Goldrich to protest at the \\"abusive treatment\\". Rawda Al Otaiba, Director of the American Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed her dismay at Mr Al Menhali treatment: \\"Police arrested and searched the Emirati without any right. He was also defamed by publishing footage of the incident,\\" reported state news agency, Wam. Mr Goldrich apologised, and said the incident was an exception, and unacceptable. He said authorities in Ohio would be working with the embassy to clarify the matter. The US Ambassador to the UAE, Barbara Leaf, said Mr Al Menhali’s experience in the US was deeply regrettable: \\"We are pleased that city officials met him & apologised,\\" she tweeted on Monday. The US embassy in the UAE issued the following statement: \\"Since learning of the regrettable situation that took place in Avon, Ohio last week, the UAE Embassy has been in close contact with Mr. Al Menhali and his family.\\" The UAE’s Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba spoke with Avon’s Mayor and asked that he take appropriate steps to ensure a similar incident does not happen again, the statement read. Mr Al Menhali is still in the US continuing his treatment. The hotel where the incident took place has yet to comment. Marriott International which owns the Fairfield Inn and Suites issued the following statement: \\"The unusual behaviour of a man that had entered the hotel caused the hotel staff to be concerned. A call was placed to the local authorities who responded right away. As this is a police matter it would be inappropriate to comment further\\". nalremeithi@thenational.ae UPDATE: Police and officials apologise to Emirati arrested in US ||||| Deputy ambassador apologises after Ohio receptionist calls 911 on man in formal dress, thinking he was a member of Isis The United Arab Emirates has urged men to avoid wearing the white robes, headscarf and headband of the national dress when travelling abroad, after a businessman visiting the United States was wrestled to the ground and held as an Islamic State suspect. UAE media reported that the Emirati man was detained in Avon, Ohio, last week after a female clerk at a local hotel called 911 to report what she had described as a man affiliated to Islamic State, according to the Arabic-language al-Bayan newspaper. The English language newspaper the National said the receptionist at the Fairfield Inn hotel called the police after she heard the man talking on his phone in the hotel lobby. The woman reportedly described him as “a suspicious man with disposable phones – two of them – in a full head dress.” Gulf News, another UAE newspaper, published photos of the Emirati man in white robes being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed before being led away by police. The man, who sustained injuries in the incident, told the National that the police were “brutal”. A search by police found no weapons on him. The National reported that when police spoke to the hotel clerk, they found he had not made any statements related to Isis. Officers said there had been a miscommunication. In a message on a foreign ministry Twitter account aimed at citizens travelling abroad, the ministry said on Saturday: UAE businessman pays out £3.4m for number plate '1' Read more “For citizens travelling outside the country, and in order to ensure their safety, we point out not to wear formal dress while travelling, especially in public places,” the message dated 2 July stated, without referring to the Avon incident. The foreign ministry said in a statement it had summoned US deputy ambassador Ethan Goldrich to protest the “abusive treatment by the Ohio police of a UAE citizen” and to deplore the filming of his arrest which it described as defamation. “The UAE cares for the safety of its citizens and demands clarifications about the incident,” it said in a statement carried by WAM state news agency. Goldrich “apologised” for the incident, pledging to seek clarifications from authorities in the state of Ohio, WAM said. The mayor of Avon and the city’s police chief also apologised. City of Avon, OH (@CityofAvonOH) Here's an update to the incident that occurred in our community earlier this week: https://t.co/T7SAbzuaMu https://t.co/TRalKrqGmQ Local newspapers said Avon police released the man after they realised their mistake, but he fainted and needed hospital treatment. The 41-year-old, identified as Ahmed al-Menhali, was visiting the United States for medical treatment, The National said. Al-Bayan reported that the man had hired a lawyer to pursue the case, saying he had received no apology from either the police or the hotel.

Owen was born in Chester, Cheshire, the fourth child of Jeanette and Terry Owen. His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family. A boyhood Everton fan, Owen attended Rector Drew Primary School in Hawarden, Flintshire, north Wales and by the age of ten, some of the nation's leading scouts were monitoring his progress. Owen scored his first goal for United back from injury in a 7-1 pre-season victory against a League of Ireland XI on 4 August 2010 at the newly built Aviva Stadium. On 22 September 2010, Owen netted his first goals of the season as he netted twice during a 5-2 away win over Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup. Four days later, Owen scored his first league goal of the season as he netted United's second equaliser with his first touch in a 2-2 away draw against Bolton Wanderers. Owen's first goal of 2011 came in United's 2-1 FA Cup victory over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on 29 January. On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team's next four games. His return match was on 19 March when he returned to the bench for United's game against Bolton. By the time of United's penultimate game of the season, he had reached the number of league appearances required for a title winner's medal - his first in 15 seasons as a professional. The game, on 14 May 2011, only required United to draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park to win the title, and a 1-1 draw secured it for them. Owen was an unused substitute in the game. Owen scored United's final goal in their last league game of the season, at home to Blackpool, in which the Red Devils won 4-2. Owen was an unused substitute in Man United's uninspiring Champions League final defeat to Barcelona, marking the end of his season. He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 1 June 2011.","completion":"This text is about Michael Owen, the former professional footballer.

Step 1: Create two empty lists, 'alphabetical_elements' and 'numerical_elements' Step 2: Iterate through the input list > If the element is alphabetical, add it to 'alphabetical_elements' > If the element is numerical, add it to 'numerical_elements' Step 3: Combine 'alphabetical_elements' and 'numerical_elements' Step 4: Return the combined list Using these steps, let's solve the problem for the given input: Input: ['y', 'Q', '1655', '3249', 'E', 'C', '633', '2539', '9089'] Step 1: alphabetical_elements = [] numerical_elements = [] Step 2: - 'y' is alphabetical, so alphabetical_elements = ['y'] - 'Q' is alphabetical, so alphabetical_elements = ['y', 'Q'] - '1655' is numerical, so numerical_elements = ['1655'] - '3249' is numerical, so numerical_elements = ['1655', '3249'] - 'E' is alphabetical, so alphabetical_elements = ['y', 'Q', 'E'] - 'C' is alphabetical, so alphabetical_elements = ['y', 'Q', 'E', 'C'] - '633' is numerical, so numerical_elements = ['1655', '3249', '633'] - '2539' is numerical, so numerical_elements = ['1655', '3249', '633', '2539'] - '9089' is numerical, so numerical_elements = ['1655', '3249', '633', '2539', '9089'] Step 3: Now, we just need to combine 'alphabetical_elements' and 'numerical_elements': Output: ['y', 'Q', 'E', 'C', '1655', '3249', '633', '2539', '9089'] Thus, the final output for the given task is: ['y', 'Q', 'E', 'C', '1655', '3249', '633', '2539', '9089']"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: See if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours. If she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it, chances are she’s interested in you. She may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks you're not looking. Of course, you don't want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy. Just glance in her direction, or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds. However, some girls are just shy, and they may not want to make eye contact with you. Try encouraging her with other steps. Smiling shows your interest, and makes it easy for her to smile back at you. Sometimes, it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before you’re ready to actually talk to each other. Even if you’re nervous, smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people. In other words, when you smile at her, her brain perceives it as a reward, making her happier to be around you. Don’t just hang around with the same group of friends. It’s much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone who's with a large group, so if you make sure you're alone sometime when she's around, she might come over and talk to you. You could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available. You never know what might happen. For instance, maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school. Make it a point to show up there, too. Try sitting at a table near her, where she can see you. ” It’s an easy first step and a way to acknowledge that you’re noticing each other. You don’t have to do much more at first if you’re shy. If she’s unwilling to say “hi” back, she might not be interested. Try it a few more times, but if she never responds, let it go. You might be nervous about approaching her, but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her. If she’s responded to your greeting, you can move ahead to actually talking to each other. Consider what you know about her, as that can lead to a conversation. Is she part of the drama club, or does she play sports? Engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation. You could even try to be funny, but that can be hard. You could ask, \\"Is your training on the track team really hard?\\" or \\"What did you think of the pep rally?\\" You could also say something like, \\"Wasn't the food gross in the cafeteria today? Isn't it awful what they call food?\\" or \\"Don’t you think Mr. Harrison looks and sounds a lot like Yoda?\\" Now that you have some possible questions, find a good time to talk to her. It should be a time when neither of you is hurrying off to class or activities, and hopefully when you’re both alone. It can feel really awkward the first time, but it does get easier. If she really responds and starts asking you questions too, chances are that she is interested in you. If she doesn’t really respond, it’s likely she’s not that into you. For example, if you asked whether her track training was hard, she might say, \\"Yes, but I love it!\\" In that case, you could say, \\"Cool! What do you love about it? I've always thought about getting into running, but it seems really hard.\\"","completion":"To determine if a girl is interested in you, observe her body language, and in particular, her eye contact. If she consistently makes eye contact, blushes, or steals quick glances when she thinks you're not looking, these cues may suggest she's interested in you. However, avoid staring at her, as this may appear creepy. Instead, try holding her gaze for a few seconds or glancing in her direction. When interacting with her, smiling can effectively convey your interest. This elicits a positive response because the brain perceives a smile as a reward. Give her an opportunity to approach you by sometimes spending time alone rather than with friends, as it's easier to engage someone who's by themselves. You could also visit places where she frequently spends time, such as a library, to increase chances of interaction. Starting with a simple greeting can ease the initial conversation. If she responds, try engaging her with topics related to school activities or things you know she likes. This could involve asking questions about her hobbies or making light-hearted comments about shared experiences at school. Look for an appropriate moment when neither of you is in a hurry and possibly alone to have these conversations. As the conversation unfolds, pay attention to how she responds. If she engages and reciprocates with questions, there's a higher likelihood that she's interested in you. However, if her responses are minimal or unenthusiastic, it's possible that she may not be as interested as you thought. Remember, it may feel awkward during the initial conversation, but as you get to know each other better, the interaction should become easier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea. But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

By stating that the movie \\"simultaneously degrades its characters, its stars, and its audience,\\" the critic is suggesting that the film is disrespectful and insulting to multiple aspects of the filmmaking and viewing experience. The use of the word \\"degrades\\" has a negative connotation, as it implies a lowering in quality, moral or otherwise, which adds to the overall negativity of the review. When a movie degrades its characters, it might involve poorly constructed character arcs or portray them in a demeaning manner. This implies that the movie doesn't take the time or effort to build strong, well-rounded, and relatable characters that appeal to the audience. The comment that the movie also degrades its stars suggests that there could be possible issues with the casting or that the actors are not well utilized in their roles, which might cause the potential of the stars to be overshadowed, wasted, or poorly represented. Furthermore, by stating that the movie degrades its audience, the critic is implying that the film fails to engage the viewers intellectually, emotionally, or morally. This could mean that the movie does not do justice to the expectations of the audience or that the content itself might be offensive or inconsiderate. The overall focus on degradation conveys a disapproval of the movie and its content, as it implies that being associated with such material is degrading for all parties involved. In conclusion, based on the short movie review provided, the critic's perspective on the movie is almost certainly negative.

This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect.

The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect.

Given the question: Benedykt Ossolinsky, age 39, began to grow childish. On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" on it.

Please answer this question: Who wrote the 1924 musical composition ‘Rhapsody in Blue’?","completion":"The 1924 musical composition 'Rhapsody in Blue' was written by George Gershwin, an accomplished American pianist, composer, and conductor. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 26, 1898, Gershwin grew up in a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. He flourished both as a composer of popular songs and as a composer of more serious orchestral works. Gershwin's innate talent for blending elements of jazz, classical, and popular music made his compositions highly distinctive and unique. 'Rhapsody in Blue' was first conceived by Gershwin's longtime friend and collaborator, band leader Paul Whiteman, who wanted to create a concert that demonstrated the evolution of American music. Whiteman later asked Gershwin to contribute an original piece for an all-jazz concert he was planning, which would later be known as \\"An Experiment in Modern Music.\\" Gershwin, who was hesitant at first, decided to take on the project after a newspaper article announced that he was working on a \\"jazz concerto.\\" The musical piece was composed in a very short period, in approximately three weeks, as Gershwin faced a tight deadline for the concert. Gershwin drew inspiration from his various experiences, including the sounds of the bustling city of New York, as is evident in the diverse musical motifs present throughout the composition. The premiere of 'Rhapsody in Blue' took place on February 12, 1924, at New York's Aeolian Hall, with Gershwin playing the piano alongside Paul Whiteman's Palais Royal Orchestra. 'Rhapsody in Blue' combines classical composition techniques with the rhythmic and improvisational elements of jazz. The piece begins with an iconic clarinet glissando, which was originally a joke from the rehearsal but ultimately became one of the most memorable openings in 20th-century American music. The composition was met with critical and commercial success, and it propelled Gershwin into the spotlight as a serious composer on the American music scene. 'Rhapsody in Blue' has since become emblematic of the fusion between jazz and classical music, standing the test of time as a unique and beloved work that is still widely enjoyed today. George Gershwin continued to produce a plethora of prominent works throughout his life, including the opera 'Porgy and Bess' and the orchestral piece 'An American in Paris.' Unfortunately, Gershwin's brilliant career was cut short as he tragically passed away at the young age of 38 from a brain tumor. Despite his early death, Gershwin's prolific output and groundbreaking compositions left an enduring impact on American music that echoes through the generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Herbs are tender plants that won’t do well if sown in cold temperatures. Therefore, you should plant herbs outdoors in the spring once the temperatures, and the soil, have begun to warm up. To find the average frost dates for your area, check your local weather app. If you purchased herb plants, rather than seeds, you’ll need to dig holes for each plant. Make sure the holes have the same depth as the container and are twice as wide. Use your hands to carefully remove the plant from the container and gently break up the roots. Place the plant in the soil, with only the root ball below the surface, and lightly pack the soil around the plant. Use your finger or the eraser end of a pencil to make shallow indentations in the soil. Place 1 seed in each space, then lightly cover it with soil. Take care not to bury the seeds too deep, or they won’t germinate. Once your seeds or plants are in the garden or containers, lightly water them to compact the soil. If you transplanted the herbs, be sure to water down to the root zone to help the plant become established in the soil. Since many herbs look similar, it’s a good idea to place labels in the garden or containers. You can put the seed packet in a plastic bag and staple it to a wooden stake, which can then be placed in front of the herbs. You could also use the plant label that came with the plants and stick it into the soil near the herbs. Or, you could even make your own labels, such as by painting the herb names on rocks and placing them near each herb. No matter which type of label you choose, make sure it is waterproof!","completion":"Plant herbs outside in warm spring temperatures, making holes for each plant, and gently place the plant or seeds in the soil with labels, and water them carefully."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the question \\"Where does this conversation take place?\\" and the answer \\"at their home\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the air pressure drops happens, how will it affect more sediment is deposited. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, I will consider each step of the sedimentary rock formation process and identify the potential effects of a drop in air pressure on sediment deposition. 1. Wind and water erode rocks: A decrease in air pressure can result in stronger winds due to a steeper pressure gradient. Stronger winds can result in increased rates of erosion, causing more sediment to be available. 2. The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks: With stronger winds, as a result of the air pressure drop, there would likely be more sediment being picked up and transported by the wind. 3. Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice: The decrease in air pressure could potentially lead to a change in weather conditions, affecting the transport of sediment. For example, stronger winds might carry sediment further away before deposition. 4. Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times: The deposition of sediment could be affected by a change in air pressure. More sediment might be deposited if stronger winds lead to increased erosion of source rocks. 5. The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time: As more sediment is deposited in an area, the sediment layers would continue to accumulate. While the change in air pressure might not directly affect this step, it could influence the amount of sediment being deposited. 6. The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment: A drop in air pressure could indirectly affect this step by altering the rate at which sediment accumulates. However, the compression process itself would not be directly affected by air pressure change. 7. The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight: While the rate of sediment deposition might be affected by air pressure changes, the lithification process by which sediment becomes sedimentary rock remains the same, regardless of air pressure conditions. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of a drop in air pressure could have an indirect effect on sediment deposition, primarily through increased wind erosion and the transportation of sediment. However, the processes of compression and lithification remain mostly unaffected by the change in air pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

New Year axe murder victim Tanis Bhandari was killed after a trivial argument over a cigarette, it was claimed yesterday. The 27-year-old plasterer was described as a ‘peaceful’ former member of the Royal Navy who doted on his younger siblings. More than 100 of his friends and family gathered yesterday outside the village pub where he died in a horrific axe attack an hour into the new year. Scroll down for video. Tanis Bhandari, 27, was killed in an axe and knife attack outside a quiet village pub on New Year's Eve. A spokesman for the pub said it was saddened by the unprovoked attack on a group of 'lovely' people. Above, mourners gather outside the Kings Arms. Dozens of bunches of flowers were left on the tiny green by the Kings Arms in sleepy Tamerton Foliot on the edge of Plymouth, Devon. Many mourners – including a woman believed to be the victim’s mother, Andrea Sharpe – wore shirts bearing the logo of his favourite football club, Liverpool. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder, though neither has been charged. It was today claimed the attack came about when one of the suspects asked a female friend of Mr Bhandari's for a cigarette. When she said no, Mr Bhandari, a builder, stood in front of her to protect her from harm, a source told MailOnline. It was then he was attacked with a knife and axe-like weapon, the source added. Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm the altercation had begun over a cigarette, but said Mr Bhandari was the victim of an unprovoked attack. 'The evidence gathered so far points to this being an indiscriminate attack on a group of innocent young men, resulting in a tragic outcome,' Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said today. 'I understand and appreciate how this attack has come as a shock to many, especially the residents of Tamerton Foliot. 'I would like to reassure you that we are doing everything we can and want to highlight that we currently have two suspects in custody. 'Interviews with them are continuing and at this stage, it is my belief that no other suspects remain at large.'

'I would like to reassure you that we are doing everything we can and want to highlight that we currently have two suspects in custody. 'Interviews with them are continuing and at this stage, it is my belief that no other suspects remain at large.' An axe was later recovered by detectives, with residents asked to check their gardens and bins for a missing knife as police continued to search for clues. Mourners visited the site where Mr Bhandari and his friends were attacked to lay flowers today. Friends hung Liverpool FC scarves around a tree near the pub. Mr Bhandari was a keen supporter of the club. Mourners gathered outside the green where the group of men were attacked today to pay their respects. Mourners console one another as they lay flowers outside the Kings Arms in Tamerton Foilot. Two men, aged 20 and 21, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody. Devon and Cornwall Police this afternoon sought an extension from Magistrates to continue questioning the pair. Friends have today paid tribute to Mr Bhandari who they described as 'kind' and 'an amazing friend'. More than 100 people gathered at around 10.30am yesterday to lay flowers outside the pub in the historic village, which is popular with walkers. Liverpool football tops and scarves were tied to trees nearby. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Bhandari on Twitter and Facebook. Andy Nicholls wrote: ‘Gutted to hear that the victim of the unprovoked NYE attack in Plymouth was a former Navy shipmate. RIP Tanis “Bandi” Bhandari. Sleep well.’ Bouncer Andy Dymond-Park said he was working in the pub and saw the attack happen. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Horrendous events to witness last night and absolutely terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims and their friends and family at this sad start to the new year after what was such a good night. Bit shaken up by it all but I’m fine, feel terrible for everyone involved. It has just hit hard. Could have been anyone involved.’ A spokesman for the Kings Arms, where the 27-year-old had been celebrating with friends on New Year's Eve before his death, said the men were 'lovely' people. 'On New Year’s Eve a terrible attack was made on a lovely group of people on the way home from a great night in our pub. 'It was an unprovoked violent attack with a tragic consequences. That I feel devastated is an absolute understatement. 'I wish all the families of those involved my deepest deepest sympathy, not that this will help them in any way now but, I wish I could turn back the clock so that these events would not occur.' Mourners today paid tribute to the man described as 'kind' and 'peaceful'. One friend, who declined to be named, said: 'He was very peaceful and a very relaxed guy. 'I would say hello to him every morning when I saw him. He would often care for his younger twin siblings.' Others shared their grief on Facebook. 'Can’t believe it, I grew up in the same village as Tanis, he’s always been a kind lad, you will truly be missed bud, my thoughts are with his family and may whoever done this get what he deserves,' said Lee Ryder while Colleen Finn added: 'We've lost our jester, I feel ripped to pieces.' Police have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to come forward. Devon and Cornwall Police continue investigating the scene following the arrest of two men, aged 20 and 21. Forensics teams sweep leaves and rocks near to where the man and his friends were attacked. Police are still appealing for information about the attack which took place in the early hours of Thursday morning. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Brad had a friend that lived on Oahu, part of The Hawaiian Islands. The friend's name was Hank and he invited Brad over to visit the islands. Brad had never been there before, and he lived in London, UK. But I can use this background: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983. There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loih What is an answer for this question: Which friend lived farther from Kilauea volcano? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"Which friend lived farther from Kilauea volcano?\\" we need to compare the distances of Brad and Hank from the volcano. Step 1: Identify the locations of Brad, Hank, and the Kilauea volcano. - Brad lived in London, UK. - Hank lived on Oahu, one of the Hawaiian Islands. - The Kilauea volcano is located on the Big Island of Hawaii. Step 2: Determine the approximate distances of Brad and Hank from Kilauea. A) Distance of Brad (London, UK) to Kilauea (Big Island of Hawaii) London is approximately 7,200 miles (11,587 km) away from the Hawaiian Islands, which is part of the United States. B) Distance of Hank (Oahu, Hawaii) to Kilauea (Big Island of Hawaii) Oahu is part of the Hawaiian Islands and is closer to the Kilauea volcano within the island chain. The distance between Oahu and the Big Island is approximately 200 miles (322 km). Step 3: Compare the distances. Brad's distance to Kilauea: 7,200 miles (11,587 km) Hank's distance to Kilauea: 200 miles (322 km) Answer: Brad lived farther from the Kilauea volcano compared to Hank since he was in London, UK, and Hank was on Oahu, one of the Hawaiian Islands which is closer to the volcano located on the Big Island of Hawaii."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The given equation is: 42*p + 0*p = 15*p + 8*p - 361 First, we can simplify this equation by combining the terms with the 'p' variable on each side. (42 + 0) * p = (15 + 8) * p - 361 42p = 23p - 361 Next, we need to isolate the 'p' variable. To do this, we can subtract 23p from both sides of the equation. 42p - 23p = 23p - 361 - 23p Which simplifies to: 19p = -361 Now, we just need to solve for 'p' by dividing by 19 on both sides of the equation. 19p / 19 = -361 / 19 This simplifies to: p = -19 So, the answer is p = -19."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Courtesy Jane Rosenberg While a federal court takes the next step in resolving Deflategate, a courtroom sketch emerged Wednesday of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and the duo's assorted legal counsel. The sketch, by artist Jane Rosenberg, lit up the Internet for its rough and approximate portrayal of Brady. It features, from left, Jeff Pash, NFL executive vice president and general counsel; Goodell; Gregg Levy, NFL counsel; Adolpho Birch, NFL executive VP; Don Yee, Brady's agent; and Brady. To be fair, Brady's face is one of the most recognizable in sports. Anything but pure photorealism would have provoked comments. And a courtroom artist's job is to capture the scene quickly.

These were among the headlines and observations overshadowing the New England quarterback’s hearing in federal court on Wednesday, at least as far as the response on social media is concerned. Brady is appealing a four-game suspension for his role in the deflation of footballs used in the AFC championship game in January. This is the sketch, by the New York artist Jane Rosenberg, that prompted the backlash: In 2011, The New York Times noted that Ms. Rosenberg’s likeness of Robert De Niro during a court appearance in Manhattan was “remarkably accurate.” She has been a sketch artist for 35 years, depicting a litany of public figures including Woody Allen, Martha Stewart, Bill Cosby and John Gotti. In a telephone interview, Ms. Rosenberg said drawing celebrities is her most difficult task, as people already have an image of how the person is supposed to look. She was hired by several media clients to attend Brady’s hearing, and was “under a lot of pressure to work very quickly and do the best I can on the short deadline I’m on.” “I’m getting bad criticism that I made him look like Lurch,” she said, referring to the Addams Family character. “And obviously I apologize to Tom Brady for not making him as good-looking as he is.” In response, Twitter users deployed their best photo-editing skills. As of Wednesday evening, Ms. Rosenberg said she was not bothered by the response, partly because she didn’t understand it. She doesn’t use social media, though some people had shown her some of the tweets on their phones. She also doesn’t watch the N.F.L. Photo “I don’t know what the big deal is,” she said. “I’m a background person. There’s a whole new world of social media, and I’m not with it.” There were other sketch artists in the courtroom, though the others drew Brady quite differently and, as a result, didn’t receive as much attention. Andrea Shepard and her mother, Shirley, approached Brady after the hearing and asked him to sign a couple of their sketches, which he did without a fuss. Asked later if they tried to get Brady to buy a sketch, Andrea Shepard said: “I think they were all upset because they were together,” referring to Brady and Commissioner Roger Goodell. No, she didn’t get a sale. ||||| \\"Tell Tom Brady I'm Sorry.\\" Q&A; With the DeflateGate Courtroom Sketch Artist Jane Rosenberg has been a courtroom sketch artist for decades, having drawn scenes from high profile cases such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, as well as others involving celebrities such as Woody Allen, Martha Stewart, and John Gotti. On Wednesday, she was tasked to do courtroom sketches for Wednesday's settlement hearing in the ongoing #deflategate saga. Her sketch of Tom Brady in the courtroom went viral almost instantly, and not all of the attention was flattering. Many people on social media criticized her depiction of the quarterback. VICE Sports spoke to her over the phone as she was leaving the courthouse and first experiencing the bizarre whirlwind of everything that comes with her painstaking work being turned into a viral meme. It was yet another bit of nonsense from a whole case full of nonsense. Rosenberg was just doing her job and certainly wasn't looking for the attention. Rosenberg seemed a bit flustered on the phone as she was dealing with having unexpectedly become part of the day's news. What kind of response have you seen to the sketch so far? Well I haven't seen any. People are emailing me and calling me and trying to interview me. I don't do Twitter or Facebook so social media is not my thing. But obviously it's gone viral. Some people are like sending me snippets though––things, complaints, that I made him look like Lurch or whatever. Tell Tom Brady, I'm sorry. He's a very good looking guy and if I didn't make him look good enough, I'll try harder next time. When you are doing the sketches, how realistic do you try to make it look? And how much are you just trying to capture a mood? I'm working very quickly. Obviously I have a lot of pressure on me, and it's time pressure. It's lucky if I have a few minutes. So I'm just trying to grab onto something, just as quick as I can. Now, this Tom Brady thing, I did this whole wide shot with a million people in it. And everybody's focusing on that one little fraction of the whole picture, of Tom Brady. But it's really a big wide composition. There's a lot of people and the whole courtroom in it. When you have a case like this with a highly recognizable person, do you feel any more pressure? Yes, I do. I do feel more pressure. It's horrible. You hate that. Especially when they're good looking, that's the worst. I'd rather do famous terrorists or something. Do you plan on looking up any of the reaction when you get home? I don't know. I don't do Twitter. I don't even know if I could. I don't know how I'm going to see it all. I'm sure it's horrible. Maybe I'll be depressed tomorrow, who knows? Right now I'm not reacting. Does it bother you if people are making fun of it or anything like that? Does it bother me, people making fun of me? I don't know. It hasn't sunk in yet. I might be very depressed. I'm my biggest critic, myself. So I feel terrible when I do a bad sketch. So when the whole world is criticizing me, I might just kill myself. Or I might just laugh it off.

Title: Disappointing Review: I found this book to be disappointing. The author spends too much time explaining and describing things which add nothing to the main point of the book; an extraordinary tale of survival in Nazi Germany. I found that the story could have been told in less than half of the pages that the author uses and not spend countless chapters on descriptions of relatives and acquaintances that have little to do with the overall story.

The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems.

Question 2: Christmas: Why does Santa wear red? OPTIONS: (A). no. (B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Did Father Christmas used to wear green clothes? If so, why was his clothing color changed to red? Answer: Yes, Father Christmas, the British precursor to Santa Claus, did indeed wear green clothes, traditionally representing the pagan symbol of the rebirth of the sun during the winter season. However, this portrayal of Father Christmas evolved over time, and he was sometimes depicted wearing different colored robes, including red. As for the change to red clothing, this can be attributed to multiple factors. One of the most popular explanations is the influence of Coca-Cola's 1930s advertising campaign. Artist Haddon Sundblom was commissioned by Coca-Cola to create images of Santa Claus for their advertisements. He drew inspiration from the 1823 poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (commonly known as \\"The Night Before Christmas\\") by Clement Clarke Moore, which describes St. Nicholas in a red suit. Sundblom's illustrations gained widespread popularity and cemented the image of Santa Claus/Father Christmas in a red suit with white fur trims. However, it is important to note that even before the Coca-Cola campaign, American illustrator Thomas Nast depicted Santa Claus in a red suit in his drawings for Harper's Weekly in the 1860s. St. Nicholas, the historical figure who inspired Santa Claus, was also associated with the color red as he was a bishop in the 4th century, and bishops wore red vestments at that time. Question 2: Christmas: Why does Santa wear red? OPTIONS: (A). no. (B). yes. In the context of the question, \\"no\\" and \\"yes\\" are not appropriate answers. However, the correct answer, based on the information provided above, is that Santa Claus wears red due to a combination of factors, such as the influence of Thomas Nast's and Haddon Sundblom's illustrations, the historic association with St. Nicholas, and the 1823 poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\\" To clarify if the questions are asking the same thing: Question 1 asks about Father Christmas, specifically if he wore green clothes and why the color changed to red. It pertains to the historical and cultural roots of Father Christmas' attire and the factors that contributed to the change in color. Question 2 asks why Santa Claus wears red clothes. It is seeking an explanation for the current popular depiction of Santa Claus' attire. Both questions touch upon the history and origin of Santa Claus and Father Christmas' attire, but they are not exactly the same. Question 1 delves into the gradual transformation of Father Christmas' clothing, while Question 2 aims to explain why Santa Claus is popularly depicted wearing red. Nonetheless, there is significant overlap between the two questions, and the answers provided for each question touch upon the same historical and cultural factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the father of former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Austen Chamberlain, who became chancellor of the exchequer. Historians, government ministers and MPs are meeting in Birmingham to mark his achievements, 100 years since his death. Joseph Chamberlain was born in Camberwell, London, on 8 July, 1836. While attending University College School in London he also worked in his father's shoemaking business. At the age of 18 he was sent to his uncle's screw-making business, Nettlefolds, in Birmingham, mainly to protect his father's Â£10,000 investment in the firm. By his 30s he had made enough money to retire, but had garnered an appetite for local politics and in 1867 joined what was then Birmingham town council. It was not granted city status until 1889. \\"He was strongly influenced to get into politics by the Unitarian church who believed the only form of faith was what they called 'up and doing' - putting a civic gospel into practice,\\" said Dr Ian Cawood, from Newman University in Birmingham. \\"He was one of the more successful at doing this because he had great business sense and the money to support himself.\\" Chamberlain became mayor of Birmingham in 1873. His first major decision was to buy both the Birmingham and Staffordshire gas companies and effect a hostile takeover of Birmingham Waterworks. The following year he launched his Â£1.75m city improvement scheme, which used money from the gas industry and public funds to build libraries, schools and swimming pools. It also included clearing slum housing to build a \\"Parisian boulevard-style\\" road, Corporation Street. His legacy can still be seen across the city and includes the Victorian Law Courts on Corporation Street and his family home, Highbury Hall, built in 1880. The estate, which includes Highbury Park, has been run by Birmingham City Council under the terms of a trust set up by the Chamberlain family in the 1930s. The hall is used as a wedding venue. It was Chamberlain's achievements in Birmingham that catapulted him on to the national stage as Liberal MP for the then town in 1876 and President of the Board of Trade in William Gladstone's government in 1880. Prof Peter Marsh, who wrote Chamberlain's biography in 1994, said: \\"Under his guidance Birmingham was known as the best-governed city in the industrial world. \\"Although he had his critics, the thinking then was if you could carry Birmingham you could carry the country - it had huge national prominence.\\" The BBC's political editor for the Midlands, Patrick Burns, said: \\"His rise was fast - he was just over 40 when he became the first industrialist to hold a cabinet position. \\"We have seen examples where people have been put forward after capitalising on local issues - David Blunkett was a big figure in Sheffield before he moved to government - but they tend to be the exception rather than the rule.\\" Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore said he believed local authorities now yearned for a return to Chamberlain's values. \\"He showed that a great city must not only have thriving businesses, but powerful civic institutions and governance that cares about health, housing and the education of its citizens,\\" said the Labour politician. \\"Today, we are far too reliant on central government for funding and hemmed in by regulations. In Birmingham there are a number of memorials to Joseph Chamberlain, but no statue. There is the \\"Old Joe\\" clock tower at the University of Birmingham and a monument in Chamberlain Square. A college, a bar and a gym are named after him. To coincide with the 100th anniversary of Chamberlain's death, historians are starting a campaign to have a statue erected. A marble statue was put up in Westminster Abbey. It was later relocated to a corridor outside a House of Lords committee room. Dr Ian Cawood from Newman University said the city council had looked at the idea of bringing the statue to Birmingham, but it would cost about Â£80,000. \\"I believe if we were given more freedom we could really drive economic growth and improve the lives of our citizens.\\" Dr Cawood said Chamberlain was seen as Britain's \\"first truly modern, professional politician\\". He is credited as the first MP to print and hand out propaganda leaflets, much like today's election flyers, he said. But while his public persona grew, his ambitions to land the job of prime minister all but ended in 1886, when he resigned from the government over William Gladstone's Irish Home Rule proposals. \\"Chamberlain believed giving Ireland a separate parliament could lead to the eventual break-up of the British Empire,\\" said Mr Cawood. \\"It was a desperate mistake which left him on the wrong side of the government divide. \\"He ended up having to become an ally of the Conservatives, but neither they nor the Liberals really wholly trusted him after that.\\" Following the setback Chamberlain became colonial secretary in Lord Salisbury's government in 1895. \\"His issue was empire building. He had worked to build up the screws business he had built up Birmingham and he used the same ethos for his work with the colonies,\\" said Prof Marsh. \\"He raised the Empire to the height of its power at the beginning of the 20th Century to see off the growing rivalry from France, Germany and the rising United States.\\" In September 1903, Joseph Chamberlain resigned from office so he could advocate a scheme abandoning free trade and imposing taxes on foreign imports. The issue split the Conservative Party and resulted in a landslide victory for the Liberal Party in the 1906 general election. The following July, days after his 70th birthday, Chamberlain suffered a stroke that paralysed his right side and ended his political career. He died in July 1914 and was buried in Keyhill Cemetery, Birmingham, after his family turned down the offer for him to be laid to rest in Westminster Abbey. \\"In Birmingham there are tributes to him, but the name of Joseph Chamberlain is not as famous as you would expect based on the colossal influence he had in his day,\\" said Patrick Burns. \\"I think to some extent it's the passage of time; partly it is because he never became prime minister and when people hear the Chamberlain name they think of his son Neville who did get to number 10.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Joseph Chamberlain is an influential figure in British history who left a significant mark on the city of Birmingham through his investments and developments. Born in 1836 in Camberwell, London, Chamberlain entered the world of politics after achieving success in business, eventually becoming mayor of Birmingham in 1873 and then being elected as Liberal MP for the town in 1876. During his tenure as mayor, Chamberlain oversaw a number of critical decisions. He purchased both the Birmingham and Staffordshire gas companies and spearheaded a hostile takeover of Birmingham Waterworks. By utilizing profits from the gas industry and public funds, Chamberlain launched a £1.75 million city improvement scheme in 1874 which led to the construction of libraries, schools, and swimming pools. His initiatives also resulted in the development of Corporation Street, featuring a Parisian boulevard-style roadway that replaced slum housing. Chamberlain's legacy is apparent throughout the city to this day, with landmarks such as the Victorian Law Courts on Corporation Street and Highbury Hall, his family home built in 1880, standing testament to his impact. Under his leadership, Birmingham was known as the best-governed city in the industrial world. His time as mayor ultimately propelled him onto the national political stage, culminating in his appointment as President of the Board of Trade in William Gladstone's government in 1880. Later, as colonial secretary in Lord Salisbury's government from 1895, Chamberlain focused on empire-building, working to raise the British Empire's prominence and power in response to growing rivalries with France, Germany, and the United States. However, his decision to resign and push for a scheme that would involve imposing taxes on foreign imports proved divisive, splitting the Conservative Party and leading to the Liberal Party's landslide victory in the 1906 general election. In July 1907, at the age of 70, Chamberlain's political career came to an abrupt end following a stroke that left him paralyzed. He passed away in July 1914 but, despite his remarkable influence, his name is often overshadowed by his sons, Neville Chamberlain, who became Prime Minister, and Austen Chamberlain, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Solve 0 = -40*r + 4*r + 144 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -40*r + 4*r + 144 for r, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -40*r and 4*r are like terms since they both involve the variable r. We can combine them by adding them together: 0 = (-40*r + 4*r) + 144 0 = (-36*r) + 144 Step 2: Isolate the variable term, r. In order to isolate r, we need to get rid of the constant term (144) on the right side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 144 from both sides: 0 - 144 = -36*r -144 = -36*r Step 3: Solve for r. Now we need to get r by itself. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient -36: -144 / -36 = (-36*r) / -36 4 = r So, the solution to the math problem is r = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Construct the sentence in Czech while keeping in mind the typical Czech sentence structure and word order. Czech generally follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, just like English. However, in questions, the question word typically comes first, followed by the verb, subject, and object: - \\"proč\\" (why) + \\"já\\" (I) + \\"spím\\" (am sleeping) + \\"na podlaze\\" (on the floor) 4. Combine the words together to form the Czech translation of the sentence: - \\"Proč já spím na podlaze?\\" 5. Double-check the translation for accuracy and make any necessary adjustments.

Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \\"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\\" His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of \\"the most recent eight songs that [he'd] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar\\" to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said: \\"I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately.\\" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: \\"The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest--Mudhoney and Nirvana--and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.\\" The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled \\"Kiwi Maddog 20/20\\" (a reference to the low-end fortified wine), had full band instrumentation. One of Smith's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, Smith was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. She later recorded one of his songs, \\"I Figured You Out\\", which he had discarded for sounding \\"too much like the Eagles\\". The same year, Smith released a split 7\\" single with Pete Krebs, contributing the track \\"No Confidence Man\\" as the single's B-side.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was Roman candle an album?","completion":"Yes, Roman Candle was an album.

After all, it wasn't like his life was that interesting. Sure, he came from a well-known family with an extensive history in the public eye, but he had made a conscious effort to stay out of the limelight and focus on what really mattered – his own goals, interests, and personal accomplishments. As he continued to avoid the persistent reporter, he began to wonder what it was about him that had garnered her attention in the first place. Was it the fact that he was the introverted, quieter member of the family? Or could it be that she had caught wind of a secret he had been keeping all these years? In either case, he knew that the best thing he could do was to maintain his distance and not give her the opportunity to find anything out. But as the days went by, the reporter only seemed more determined to corner him. He found himself growing both annoyed and impressed with her tenacity. It made him realize that perhaps there was more to her than just her job – she was genuinely passionate about uncovering the truth and getting to the heart of the stories she reported on. He had to admit, there was something almost admirable about that. It wasn't long until their paths crossed once again, and this time, she approached him with an unexpected proposition. \\"I know you're not interested in interviews or publicity,\\" she began cautiously, \\"But I was wondering if you might consider helping me with a different kind of project – something that I believe would mean a great deal to our community.\\" Curious, he couldn't help but ask her to elaborate. She explained that she had been working on an investigation into a local scandal that involved corruption, environmental destruction, and social injustices. She was confident that with his connections, expertise, and influence, he could play a crucial role in exposing the truth and bringing those responsible to justice. As she spoke, he couldn't deny the passion and conviction in her voice. It was evident that she truly cared about the issues she was researching, and he found himself wondering if perhaps this was the reason she had been so relentless in her pursuit of him. She saw a potential ally in him – someone who could make a real difference in the world. He considered her proposal carefully, weighing the potential risks and benefits. In the end, he made a decision that surprised even him – he agreed to help her with her investigation. It was time for him to step out of his family's shadow, and use his position for something more meaningful than just maintaining their public image. They quietly formed a partnership, working together to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and piece together the puzzle of the scandal. Despite the countless obstacles and challenges they faced during their investigation, their passion for justice and their determination to make a difference never wavered. They found a renewed sense of purpose in their work, and an unexpected friendship blossomed between them as they supported each other in their mission. In the end, their collaboration led to the exposure of the scandal, triggering a ripple effect of positive change throughout the community. They managed to shed light on the truth and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. The experience taught him that sometimes, even the most unlikely of partnerships could lead to the most remarkable of outcomes. It may have started with a reporter trying to dig up new information on him and his family, but it ended with them joining forces to make a real difference in their world. And although his decision to help her may have pulled him into the limelight he had so desperately tried to avoid, he knew that the impact they had made together was worth the exposure. And even as the cameras flashed and the reporters swarmed around them, he couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, he had found someone worth smiling prettily for and playing nice with. For in the midst of it all, he had discovered a friendship, a purpose, and a voice that he never knew he had."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently George Rutaganda, a friendly supplier to the hotel who also is the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal anti-Tutsi militia.As the political situation in the country deteriorates, Paul and his family observe neighbors being dragged from their homes and openly beaten in the streets.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE. According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures. Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar. The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired Gitagovinda by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: In what arenas were you able to witness the Odissi performers in the Medieval era?","completion":"In the Medieval era, you were able to witness Odissi performers in Hindu temples.

News article: ‘Captain America’: Chris Evans says CG team ‘nailed it’ with frail Steve Rogers scenes Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers in \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" (Marvel) Chris Evans can’t stop wondering – what it would be like if you were a man lost in time? It’s a mental exercise that began on the London set of “Captain America: The First Avenger,” the film that reaches theaters on July 22 with a World War II setting and the tricky challenge of winning over young Internet-era audiences with a story of the radio-days past. “A great story is a great story no matter when it’s set,” said Evans, the 29-year-old actor who will wear the red, white and blue costume of a comic-book character that dates to 1941 and was shown punching Adolf Hitler on the cover of his first newsstand issue. For the screen, the core mythology of the hero’s origin remains in place: Steve Rogers (Evans), a sickly young man deemed unfit for combat duty, volunteers for a secret experiment that transforms him into the first of a “super solider” army — but a Nazi spy kills the scientist (Stanley Tucci) before the process can be duplicated. With his compatriot James “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the hero fights the good fight against Axis foes such as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) and Arnim Zola (Toby Jones). Director Joe Johnston has some specialized experience in retro adventure as the director of the underrated, serial-spirited “The Rocketeer” in 1991 and as the visual effects art director on Steven Spielberg’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” “When you sit down to watch it, it’s certainly not ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ which is a very different kind of film in the final analysis,” Johnston said. “But sometimes when we had questions and we were stuck we would say, ‘What would Indiana Jones do? What would be the answer to this in “Raiders of the Lost Ark”?’ I’ve always loved ‘Raiders’ and the great achievement of it was the tone and the fresh feeling of the movie. It was period but didn’t feel like it was made in the period. It felt like a contemporary film about this period in the past, and that is the goal we have with ‘Captain America.’ And I can say this — it definitely has an Indiana Jones pace.” The film will have some darker nuances to it – the character of Bucky is far more haunted than the vintage version from comic books, for instance, and Captain America chafes at the way his government handlers spin his public persona. Asked about his greatest concern, Evans conceded that he fretted a great deal about the CG-effects needed for the scenes showing Steve Rogers before his transformation. “If something like that isn’t done right, it takes you right out of the movie. You’re suddenly thinking, ‘Wow that doesn’t look real, look at that actor’ and it can really ruin it. And if it’s early in the movie it can undermine the whole way the audience connects with the story.” Evans knows that fans and bloggers zeroed in on the frail Rogers sequence in their criticism of the first trailer, but he said the ongoing visual-effects work is like a sculpting process and those scenes will deliver in the finished film. “They nailed it, it works, they really put a lot of time into it. It was a big relief for me.” The entire movie is like a puzzle piece in a larger picture. Evans is now on the set of “The Avengers,” the 2012 release that pulls his character into the modern day and teams him up with Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk. That has Evans pondering some Rip Van Winkle questions. “Just think about text messaging,” Evans said. “That’s the way I communicate with my friends now. If one them calls me I’m like, ‘Why didn’t you just text me?’ And that’s pretty new. Cellphones haven’t been around that long – I remember when people didn’t have them, really – and the Internet has totally changed the world in a relatively short period of time. Think of how strange all of it would be to someone from the 1940s who looks around and wonders what happened to all the things that were important to them.” Feige: Captain America as moral compass Johnston’s default: What would Indy do?

Entailment means that the truth of one sentence guarantees or implies the truth of another sentence. In this case, the meaning and the information conveyed by the first sentence imply the meaning of the second sentence. Let us examine both sentences more closely: Sentence 1: \\"Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank!\\" This sentence implies that someone might think that Mother Greenbank is a bad sort, but the speaker wants to clarify that, in reality, she is not a bad sort. The use of \\"not\\" and \\"really\\" in the sentence negates the idea that Mother Greenbank is a bad sort. It seems like the speaker is defending Mother Greenbank against a possible misconception or negative opinion about her character. The sentence emphasizes that there is more to understand about her character than what may initially meet the eye. Sentence 2: \\"Mother Greenbank isn't the bad sort.\\" In this sentence, you have a clearer and more direct negation of the idea that Mother Greenbank is a bad sort. The sentence straightforwardly states that she is not a bad sort, which is essentially the same information conveyed in the first sentence. Because both sentences convey the idea that Mother Greenbank is not a bad sort, it can be concluded that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – You might think extra debates would be the last thing Rick Perry would want, but you’d be wrong. The Texas governor has challenged Nancy Pelosi to a mano-a-mano debate on his new part-time Congress proposal, which would halve Congress’ pay, the Hill reports. “I am in Washington Monday and would love to engage you in a public debate about my Overhaul Washington plan versus the congressional status quo,” he wrote in a letter. Pelosi hasn’t responded. Perry’s campaign is badly reeling from his grisly debate performances: His once-mighty fundraising operation is in freefall, the Houston Chronicle reports. One fundraiser, for example, says he had 15 donors lined up for an event—but after Perry’s \\"oops\\" moment, none showed up. Another fundraiser predicts Perry's Q4 haul will be between 3 million and 5 million—less than one-third of what the governor raked in during the first six weeks of his campaign. But Perry reported 15 million in the bank on Oct. 1—more than any other candidate—and that cash cushion could let him \\"stay in the game and make a comeback,\\" says one political scientist.","completion":"Title: Rick Perry Challenges Nancy Pelosi to a Debate on His Part-Time Congress Proposal Despite his recent struggles in debates and declining fundraising operations, Texas Governor Rick Perry is eager to engage in another debate. However, this time he wants to take on Nancy Pelosi in a one-on-one public discussion about his proposal for a part-time Congress. This plan would cut Congress' pay in half, challenging the current congressional status quo. In a letter to Pelosi, Perry expressed his interest in the debate, writing, \\"I am in Washington Monday and would love to engage you in a public debate about my Overhaul Washington plan versus the congressional status quo.\\" As of now, Pelosi has not responded to the invitation. The proposed Overhaul Washington plan by Perry aims at reducing the power of Congress and cutting its members' pay as a means to reform the institution. Perry believes a part-time Congress would save money and reduce the influence of special interest groups. In addition, the plan proposes a reduction in the amount of time members of Congress spend in session, arguing that this would force them to focus on the most important issues affecting the nation. However, Perry's recent debate performances have been lackluster, leading to a significant decline in his popularity and support. The Houston Chronicle reports that his once-strong fundraising operation is now in freefall. One fundraiser noted that they had 15 donors lined up for an event, but after Perry's \\"oops\\" moment in a previous debate, not a single one showed up. This sudden dip in funds has led some to predict Perry's fourth-quarter haul will amount to only 3 million to 5 million, which is less than one-third of what he managed to secure during the first six weeks of his campaign. Yet, Rick Perry remains optimistic. With 15 million in the bank at the beginning of October, he holds more cash than any other candidate. This sizable cash cushion could potentially allow Perry to \\"stay in the game and make a comeback,\\" according to one political scientist. By challenging Nancy Pelosi to a debate, Perry could also hope to regain credibility and support among potential donors and voters that have become disillusioned with his campaign due to his previous debate performances. The outcome of this proposed debate, if it takes place, remains to be seen. Should Pelosi accept Perry's challenge, it would provide a unique opportunity for the public to witness a clash of ideologies between an established Democrat and a Republican with a controversial proposal. Additionally, it would be a crucial moment for Perry to redeem himself in the eyes of his supporters and potentially steer his troubled campaign back on track."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: 1. no; 2. yes;","completion":"1. no The two questions you have posed are not the same, as they address different aspects of Burberry trench coats. The first question seeks to identify the best Burberry trench coat, while the second question deals with how Burberry trench coats generally fit. Let's explore the answers to both questions in more detail. 1. What is the best Burberry trench coat? The best Burberry trench coat can be a matter of personal preference, as it depends on factors such as fit, color, style, and fabric composition. However, one iconic and highly-regarded Burberry trench coat is the \\"The Chelsea - Long Heritage Trench Coat.\\" This classic piece features a slim fit, weather-resistant gabardine fabric, a double-breasted front, and the brand's signature check lining. Made from 100% cotton, this trench coat ensures exceptional quality and iconic design. Other popular Burberry trench coats include \\"The Kensington - Long,\\" \\"The Westminster - Long,\\" and \\"The Sandringham - Long.\\" Each has its unique features, but all of them share the classic design and superb quality that have made Burberry famous. 2. How do Burberry trench coats fit? Burberry trench coats are known for their exceptional fit, but each style has its distinct characteristics concerning fit: - The Chelsea: The Chelsea is designed for a slim fit, which makes it ideal for those seeking a tailored, more streamlined silhouette. This trench coat is suitable for more formal occasions or wearing over a tailored suit. - The Kensington: The Kensington offers a regular fit, which means it is designed to accommodate a wider range of body shapes and sizes than the slimmer Chelsea. This style is versatile and can be worn on both casual and formal occasions. - The Westminster: The Westminster comes in a relaxed fit, allowing for additional room and comfort. This style is perfect for those who desire a more casual trench coat and prefer to wear it over thicker layers, such as sweaters or blazers. - The Sandringham: The Sandringham is the most fitted trench coat style. It is meant to hug the body closely, giving it a flattering, feminine silhouette. If you do not prefer a fitted style or plan to wear the coat over thick layers, you should consider choosing a different model or size up. Whichever style you choose, it is essential to consult the size guide provided on the Burberry website or at the store, as this will help ensure that you find the best fit for your body type and styling preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What kind of a reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen? A: A:","completion":"A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen. Combustion reactions are exothermic reactions, meaning they release energy in the form of heat and light. This type of reaction is commonly observed when a fuel burns in air or when a metal reacts with oxygen. A detailed explanation of combustion reactions: Combustion reactions involve the reaction of a substance with oxygen gas (O₂) to produce oxides and release energy. The process is usually rapid and generates a significant amount of heat and light in the form of a flame. The substances that participate in combustion reactions are typically hydrocarbons or other substances containing carbon, hydrogen, and sometimes other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. In a few cases, these reactions may involve non-organic compounds or metals. The general equation for a hydrocarbon combustion reaction is: CxHy + (x + y/4) O₂ → x CO₂ + (y/2) H₂O + energy In this equation, CxHy represents a hydrocarbon, where x and y denote the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, respectively. When the hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen, it produces carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) as the products, along with the release of energy. A common example of combustion is the burning of methane (CH₄), the primary component of natural gas. The combustion reaction for methane can be represented as: CH₄ + 2 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 H₂O + energy Other examples of combustion reactions include the burning of gasoline in an internal combustion engine, the combustion of coal in a furnace, and the reaction of metal powders, such as magnesium or aluminum, with oxygen. Characteristics of combustion reactions: 1. Exothermic: Combustion reactions release a significant amount of energy in the form of heat and light. It is this energy release that makes combustion useful as a source of power, such as in engines or heaters. 2. Irreversible: Combustion reactions are generally considered to be irreversible, as the products, such as carbon dioxide and water, do not easily react to regenerate the original fuel. 3. Rapid: Combustion reactions usually proceed rapidly, evidenced by the production of a flame. The rate of the reaction depends on various factors, such as the fuel's reactivity, the presence of a catalyst, and the oxygen concentration. 4. Requires oxygen: Oxygen is a necessary component for combustion reactions, and the availability of oxygen in the surrounding environment plays a significant role in determining the rate, efficiency, and completeness of the reaction. In summary, among the given choices, a combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen. It is an exothermic and generally irreversible process that produces heat, light, and various oxide products. Combustion reactions play an essential role in various energy-generation processes and industrial applications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrodinger's work of 1926.

In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\\"Just You Wait\\"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \\"gets it\\" (\\"The Rain in Spain\\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent (\\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\").

Therefore, the complete sentence would be: \\"The nails were coming out of the wood and needed to be replaced with screws, so the screws were inserted.\\" Screws provide a more secure hold and are less prone to coming out of the wood compared to nails due to their design, threading, and method of installation. Replacing nails with screws would help ensure the wood remains securely fastened, reducing the likelihood of future issues arising from loosening elements.

This article: In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would \\"ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms\\" but that positively \\"they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality\\". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‘disguise’ of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth. contains an answer for the question: To whom is Millar referring when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm?, what is it ?","completion":"Millar is referring to the portrait painter John Michael Wright when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken between Wright and his rival, Sir Peter Lely, would demonstrate Wright's remarkable independence, unfailing integrity and charm.

Passage: William Havemeyer (1770-1851) left Germany at age 15 and arrived in New York City after learning the trade of sugar refining in London. In New York he managed a sugar house on Pine Street before opening his own refinery on Vandam Street with his brother, Frederick Christian Havemeyer, who had come to New York in 1802. Together the two brothers operated the W. & F.C. Havemeyer Company sugar refineries, before passing the business on to their sons. His son William Frederick Havemeyer, retired from the sugar refining business in 1842 and entered politics, eventually serving three terms as Mayor of New York. In 1855 the family relocated their refineries to Brooklyn, where they remained as the business grew to acquire a commanding share of the United States sugar refining market under the leadership of Frederick's grandson, Henry Osborne Havemeyer. The Havemeyer refineries were incorporated as the American Sugar Refining Company in 1891 and became known as Domino Sugar in 1900. In the 20th century several of the family's members made notable contributions to the arts.

Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous. Expert rock climbers say only the very best in the sport should do it.

Question: Information: - Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo ( 8 August 1736 -- August 1776 ) was an artist and son of the more famous Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . In 1750 , he travelled to Würzburg with his father and brother , Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo , where he worked alongside them on the decorative fresco cycle in the Würzburg Residence . A number of drawings have been attributed to him from these apprentice years . - Johann Balthasar Neumann (27 January 1687 (?) 19 August 1753), usually known as Balthasar Neumann, was a German architect and military artillery engineer who developed a refined brand of Baroque architecture, fusing Austrian, Bohemian, Italian, and French elements to design some of the most impressive buildings of the period, including the Würzburg Residence and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers (called \\"Vierzehnheiligen\\" in German). - Johann Maximilian von Welsch (1671 15 October 1745) was a German architect, High Director of Building and fortress master builder. - Fresco (plural frescos or frescoes) is a technique of mural painting executed upon freshly-laid, or wet lime plaster. Water is used as the vehicle for the pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco is derived from the Italian adjective \\"fresco\\" meaning \\"fresh\\", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting. - Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt (14 November 1668 16 November 1745) was an Austrian baroque architect and military engineer who designed stately buildings and churches and whose work had a profound influence on the architecture of the Habsburg Empire in the eighteenth century. After studying in Rome under Carlo Fontana, he constructed fortresses for Prince Eugene of Savoy during his Italian campaigns, becoming his favorite architect. In 1700 he became court engineer in Vienna, and in 1711 was named head of the court department of building. He became court architect in 1723. His designs for palaces, estates, gardens, churches, chapels, and villas were widely imitated, and his architectural principles spread throughout central and southeast Europe. Among his more important works are Palais Schwarzenberg, St. Peter's Church, and Belvedere in Vienna, Savoy Castle in Ráckeve, Schönborn Palace in Göllersdorf, and Schloss Hof. - The Würzburg Residence (German: \\"Würzburger Residenz\\") is a palace in Würzburg, Germany. Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/South German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French Style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of Würzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn in 1720, and completed in 1744. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, Domenico, painted frescoes in the building. - Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (August 30, 1727March 3, 1804) was an Italian painter and printmaker in etching. He was the son of artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and elder brother of Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo. - Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (March 5, 1696 March 27, 1770), also known as Gianbattista or Giambattista Tiepolo, was an Italian painter and printmaker from the Republic of Venice. He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain. - Germain Boffrand (16 May 1667 19 March 1754) was a French architect. A pupil of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, Germain Boffrand was one of the main creators of the precursor to Rococo called the \\" style Régence\\", and in his interiors, of the Rococo itself. In his exteriors he held to a monumental Late Baroque classicism with some innovations in spatial planning that were exceptional in France His major commissions, culminating in his interiors at the Hôtel de Soubise, were memorialised in his treatise \\"Livre d'architecture\\", published in 1745, which served to disseminate the French \\"Louis XV\\" style throughout Europe. - Robert de Cotte (1656 15 July 1735) was a French architect-administrator, under whose design control of the royal buildings of France from 1699, the earliest notes presaging the Rococo style were introduced. First a pupil of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, he later became his brother-in-law and his collaborator. After Hardouin-Mansart's death, de Cotte completed his unfinished projects, notably the royal chapel at Versailles and the Grand Trianon. What entity does 'lorenzo baldissera tiepolo' has the relation 'languages spoken or written' with? Answer:","completion":"There is no direct information available about the specific languages spoken or written by Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo.

The men argue they have a due process right to have both officially recognized. The adoption was finalized in New York, but the child was born in Louisiana. An appeals court has ruled against the same-sex couple. Article:","completion":"Title: Louisiana Denies Same-Sex Couple's Adoption Request for Amended Birth Certificate Introduction: A recent appeals court ruling in Louisiana has denied a same-sex couple the right to have both of their names listed as adoptive parents on their child's amended birth certificate. Despite having finalized the adoption in New York, where the couple resides, Louisiana's refusal to recognize the couple's rights raises questions about the state's stance on same-sex adoption and the violation of due process rights. Step 1: Present the situation Two men, who legally adopted a child in the state of New York, requested an amended birth certificate from Louisiana, where the child was born. The couple argued that they had a due process right to have both names officially recognized on the birth certificate. Step 2: Discuss the denial and appeals process Louisiana officials, however, refused to issue an amended birth certificate listing both men as the adoptive parents. The couple then took the matter to the court system, hoping to have their rights affirmed through the legal process. The case eventually reached an appeals court, which ruled against the same-sex couple. The court's decision effectively denies the couple's request for an amended birth certificate and prevents them from having both names recognized on a legal document tied to their child's birth. Step 3: Highlight potential implications and impacts This ruling brings attention to the ongoing challenges faced by same-sex couples when it comes to adoption and recognition of parental rights. It also raises questions about whether Louisiana will continue to refuse recognition of same-sex couples' rights, even when these rights are legally granted in another state. The refusal to issue an amended birth certificate with both adoptive parents' names may not only have emotional implications for this specific couple but may also present real-life logistical challenges, as birth certificates are often required for various purposes such as enrollment in schools or obtaining a passport. Step 4: Discuss the larger context of same-sex adoption rights in the U.S. While same-sex marriage has been legalized across the United States, there are still issues and inconsistencies surrounding same-sex adoption rights and recognition in different states. This case in Louisiana serves as a reminder that progress still needs to be made in order to ensure equal rights and recognition for all families, regardless of their makeup. Conclusion: The recent appeals court ruling in Louisiana highlights the ongoing challenges that same-sex couples face in adoption cases. As more states continue to recognize and protect same-sex couples' rights, there is hope for progress towards equal legal recognition for all loving families. However, cases like this one emphasize that there is still work to be done in addressing the legal disparities faced by same-sex couples and their families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A satellite is heading toward the moon to orbit and collect data. Near the moon there is an asteroid that is less than half the mass of the moon. The satellite is pulled past the asteroid and into the orbit of the moon due to the moon's much larger size. This means that the (A) moon (B) asteroid has a more powerful gravitational attraction. Answer:","completion":"The given scenario involves a satellite that is initially heading toward the moon to orbit and gather data. Along its path, it encounters an asteroid that has less than half the mass of the moon. Despite the presence of the asteroid, the satellite is pulled past it and proceeds to orbit the moon. This occurrence provides insight into the gravitational forces at play between the three celestial objects: the satellite, the moon, and the asteroid. Gravitational force is the attractive force that exists between two masses. The strength of this force depends on two factors: the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Here, F represents the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. In this specific scenario, the satellite is attracted to both the moon and the asteroid due to their masses. However, the gravitational force exerted by the moon on the satellite is more substantial than that exerted by the asteroid because the moon is significantly larger in size and mass. Consequently, the satellite gets pulled past the asteroid and ultimately enters the orbit of the moon. Given these observations, it becomes evident that the moon (option A) has a more powerful gravitational attraction than the asteroid (option B). This conclusion is based on the moon's considerably greater mass compared to the asteroid, making it the dominant gravitational influence on the satellite's trajectory. In conclusion, the satellite's trajectory being influenced more by the moon's gravitational force confirms that the moon possesses a stronger gravitational attraction than the asteroid it encountered en route. This is primarily due to the moon's much larger size and mass, which results in a greater gravitational force acting on the satellite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Therefore, to determine his age during his appearance on \\"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!,\\" we would need to know the specific year he participated in the show.

Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. and a hint : Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Please answer this question : Which city contributed less to marine pollution? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bird city contributed less to marine pollution. Step-by-step justification: 1. Pine city is located in the mountains and is inhabited by nature lovers and environmental protectors. This suggests that the people of Pine city are more conscious of their actions and its impact on the environment, making them less likely to contribute to marine pollution. 2. Bird city is situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. This means that any pollution generated by Bird city has a higher likelihood of ending up in the ocean through the river. 3. Bird city relies mainly on conventional agriculture and uses fertilizers for their crops. When these fertilizers are improperly managed or used in excess, they can runoff into the river and eventually make their way into the sea, contributing to marine pollution (as explained in the hint provided). 4. Marine pollution is caused by potentially hazardous chemicals or particles entering the ocean, and rivers are one of the main sources of such pollution. In this situation, Bird city's activities and location have a larger impact on marine pollution than Pine city.

Answer the question...who wrote the jazz classic i got rhythm??","completion":"\\"I Got Rhythm\\" is a jazz classic written by the iconic American composer and lyricist George Gershwin. Born on September 26, 1898, George Gershwin was a prolific musician in a family of musicians. His brother, Ira Gershwin, was a talented lyricist, and together they produced numerous compositions that significantly contributed to the American songbook. \\"I Got Rhythm\\" originally appeared as a fast-paced, orchestral piece in a 1930 musical called \\"Girl Crazy\\". The lyrics for this song were penned by Ira Gershwin, George's brother. The show, which starred Ethel Merman, Ginger Rogers, and Bert Lahr, was a commercial success. The song grew in popularity and took on a life of its own outside the context of the musical, thanks in large part to its catchy melody and energetic tempo, which seemed to epitomize the spirit of the jazz age. The song's signature elements include its repeated syncopated opening motif, chromatic harmonies, and upbeat, danceable rhythms. The lyrics of \\"I Got Rhythm\\" celebrate the feelings of happiness, exuberance, and carefree living, which perfectly match the musical style. \\"I Got Rhythm\\" has been performed and reinterpreted by many artists and ensembles through the years, ranging from popular singers like Judy Garland, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra to American jazz legends like Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young. The song was also adapted into a set of variations for solo piano by George Gershwin himself in 1933, titled \\"I Got Rhythm Variations,\\" which became a popular performance piece among classical pianists. George Gershwin's contribution to the world of music, particularly in jazz and popular American song, cannot be overstated. Tragically, he passed away at the young age of 38 in 1937, but his timeless creations, like \\"I Got Rhythm,\\" continue to inspire and entertain audiences around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: go to work, needed to pick up the papers for their paper route, needed to learn to ride a bike Answer:","completion":"Kendall was riding their bicycle on the street at 7 AM on Monday morning, and there could be various reasons for this. Considering the given context and possible answers, there are three potential motivations behind Kendall's early morning bike ride: going to work, needing to pick up the papers for their paper route, or learning to ride a bike. 1. Going to work: One possible reason that Kendall was riding their bicycle at 7 AM on a Monday morning is that they were commuting to work. Many people choose to ride their bikes as a mode of transportation for their daily commute for several reasons, including cost efficiency, environmental concerns, and health benefits. With the increasing popularity of cycling to work, it could very well be that Kendall was headed to their job on this Monday morning. Cycling to work has several advantages such as reduced expenses on gas, vehicle maintenance, and parking fees. Besides, cycling can help reduce one's carbon footprint and contribute to a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle. Additionally, incorporating physical activity into routine, such as biking to work, promotes better cardiovascular health, burning calories, and building muscle strength, which can help in maintaining overall well-being. 2. Picking up the papers for their paper route: Another possible explanation for Kendall riding their bike at 7 AM on a Monday morning is that they needed to pick up the newspapers for their paper route. Early morning hours are a common time for paper carriers to distribute newspapers to customers, ensuring that they have the latest news and information at the start of their day. Being a paper carrier generally requires the individual to work early mornings, as they need to deliver the newspapers before most people begin their day. Riding a bike is a convenient method of transportation for this job, as it allows for easy navigation through neighborhoods, quick stops at each customer's home, and a more environmentally-friendly approach to the task. 3. Learning to ride a bike: A third potential reason that Kendall opted for cycling at 7 AM on a Monday morning is that they were learning to ride a bike. Early morning hours tend to have less traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, allowing for a more comfortable and less stressful environment for someone learning to ride. As a beginner cyclist, choosing a less busy time of day to practice riding is beneficial as it provides the opportunity to become familiar with bike handling and basic traffic rules without the added pressure of heavy traffic or large groups of pedestrians. Additionally, learning to ride a bike early in the day can create a sense of accomplishment and motivation that may positively influence the rest of Kendall's day. In conclusion, considering the given context, Kendall's decision to ride their bicycle at 7 AM on a Monday morning could be attributed to any of the three possible answers - going to work, picking up papers for their paper route, or learning to ride a bike. Each of these scenarios suggests Kendall's engagement in responsible, environmentally-conscious, or self-improvement activities, all of which positively reflect their character and priorities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal.

Possible answers: like a good brother, like a bad person, like a thoughtless person The answer to this question is:","completion":"Cameron would likely feel like a good brother after sending a quick message to his brother saying he would be late. This is because he took the time and made the effort to communicate with his sibling, ensuring that his brother was aware of the situation and would not be unnecessarily worried or left waiting. Cameron's action of sending the message demonstrates consideration and a sense of responsibility towards his brother. Whether the reason for his lateness is within his control or not, keeping his brother informed is a sign of respect and a demonstration of their bond. By doing this, Cameron is maintaining an open and honest communication channel with his brother, thus strengthening their relationship. However, it is essential to understand that feelings can vary depending on the individual and the context of their relationship with their sibling. Cameron's emotions might be complex and could include a mix of feeling like a good brother along with some possible guilt about running late.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Summarize: In a speech on Tuesday, Royal College of Physicians president Prof Jane Dacre will warn ministers the issue must be addressed if their policy is to work. She will highlight research that shows vacant posts are not being filled and gaps in rotas are being seen. It comes as ministers are locked in a dispute with junior doctors over their plans for improving weekend care. Last week thousands of medics went on strike over the government's decision to impose a new contract on them, designed to make it cheaper to rota on staff at weekends. Prof Dacre will raise her own concerns at the RCP's annual conference in Harrogate, saying NHS trusts are struggling to find enough staff to cope with existing demands. Physicians are doctors who focus on diagnosis and treatment as opposed to surgery. They cover a whole range of areas including stroke and heart disease to the care of the elderly. Research by the RCP showed last year there were just over 13,000 consultant physicians across the UK - one in four of all consultants. But four in 10 vacant posts advertised last year went unfilled, while one in five consultants reported gaps in their junior doctor rotas. Meanwhile, one in 10 consultants say they often have to carry out junior jobs to ensure patients' care is not harmed. Prof Dacre will tell delegates: \\"I feel sorry for NHS trusts, I really do. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them. \\"If we have neither enough trainees nor consultants to run the service now, how are we going to implement a safe seven-day service?\\" She will go on to set out the case for extra funding, pointing out hospitals are racking up deficits and that funding lags behind other countries such as France and Germany. \\"It is time to revisit our national contribution to healthcare,\\" she will say. But a Department of Health spokeswoman pointed out extra money was being invested during this Parliament - Â£8bn more by 2020. She said this would help \\"make sure the right staff and support is available to create a safe NHS seven days a week\\".

Ms Fitzgerald said part of \\"the Provisional IRA's brutal legacy is the involvement in organised crime of a significant number of people who have been associated with PIRA\\". She said they \\"make full use of the reputations which they acquired as members of PIRA and do not hesitate to use their previous terror tactics\\". The head of police in the Republic of Ireland, Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan, said its findings \\"remain consistent with our previous assessments\\" and those of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC), a paramilitary activity watchdog that issued its last report in 2011 before being wound down. \\"It was never the position of the IMC - nor has it been the position of (Republic of Ireland police service) An Garda Siochana - that PIRA had disbanded and, accordingly, ceased to exist,\\" she said. \\"But the issues surrounding the continuing existence of PIRA are inevitably complex.\\" Ms O'Sullivan said it was \\"noteworthy that there is no evidence that there has been any recruitment to PIRA in recent years\\". She added: \\"I should mention that the assessment deals essentially with security issues and involvement in organised crime. \\"You will be aware that there are separate criminal investigations under way in relations to sexual abuse by PIRA members.\\" The Garda report said that since November 2010, 70 people had been charged before the Republic of Ireland's non-jury Special Criminal Court with terrorist related offences. No-one investigated or charged was affiliated to PIRA when they were arrested, the report said Thirty three of those charged had past associations with the Provisional IRA at the time of arrest before defecting to dissident republican groups. It said that during the time that the Provisional IRA was \\"engaged in what it called armed conflict\\", a substantial element of its activity in the Republic of Ireland concerned logistical support. It said there was no evidence of any so-called military departments currently in operation in the jurisdiction. However, it said there was clear evidence that a significant number of persons who have been associated with PIRA remain criminally active, particularly in organised crime, and continue to associate together\\". \\"They make full use of their 'legacy' reputations and in some cases their former terrorist tactics,\\" it said. The report said there was no evidence that this was directed by the leadership of the organisation or was for anything other than personal gain. It said the Criminal Assets Bureau, a body set up to seize cash, property and other assets of suspected criminals, had since 1996 seized 28m euros from more than 50 individuals who have had connections or associations to PIRA in the past.

They used to cause a lot of trouble and hurt people, but they have stopped doing that and now focus on politics instead. However, some people who used to be in the PIRA still do bad things like organized crime, which means they work together to break the law and make money.

Possible A: full of people, safety, lie, secure, being safe Why is \\"secure\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Secure\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because of the following reasons: 1. Situation analysis: In the question, the soldiers are on the run and in danger, which implies that they are seeking a safe place to protect themselves from potential threats. 2. Decision-making process: When selecting a location for temporary refuge or protection, considering whether the building is secure or not is essential. A secure building would provide better protection and safety for the soldiers. 3. Elimination of other choices: Looking at the other possible answers – \\"full of people,\\" \\"safety,\\" \\"lie,\\" and \\"being safe\\" – we can deduce that \\"secure\\" is the most appropriate option. - \\"Full of people\\" might not necessarily mean a safe place, as it could increase the risk of detection or harm to bystanders. - \\"Safety\\" and \\"being safe\\" are abstract concepts and do not directly refer to the quality of the building itself. - \\"Lie\\" is unrelated to the question and does not make sense in this context. 4. Alignment with human reasoning: When people think about what they would do in a similar situation, seeking a secure or well-protected location would likely be a top priority. Therefore, the answer \\"secure\\" aligns with human common sense as the soldiers would naturally want to ensure the building offers protection and minimizes potential threats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When you encounter a transition from a numeral to a letter, add a space. 3. When you encounter a transition from a small letter to a capital letter, add a space. 4.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor. There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath. Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom. This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which professional football club known as \\"the Red Devils\\" did Ernie Hine play for? A:","completion":"Ernie Hine, full name Ernest Hine, was an accomplished English footballer who played as a forward during the early to mid-20th century. He is best known for his time with the professional football club Manchester United, which is fondly referred to as \\"the Red Devils,\\" a nickname that was adopted in the 1960s. Born on November 7, 1901, in the village of Netherfield, England, Hine began his professional football career with the team Notts County F.C. It wasn't until he signed with Manchester United in the late 1920s, however, that his career truly took off. As a talented and tenacious forward, Hine made his mark on the club and became a standout player during his time with the Red Devils. Ernie Hine joined Manchester United on October 31, 1928, from Leicester City for a transfer fee of £3,750, which was a significant amount at the time. He played for Manchester United between 1928 and 1934, during which he made 122 appearances and scored a remarkable 52 goals. Hine was an unwavering performer who was highly regarded for his physical strength and massive presence on the field, which earned him the reputation as a prolific goal scorer. One of the highlights of Hine's career with Manchester United was during the 1929-1930 season, when he scored a total of 19 goals in 28 league matches, making him the team's top goal scorer for that season. Additionally, during the 1930-1931 season, Hine nearly matched his previous year's tally by netting a commendable 18 goals in 28 league matches. Beyond his prowess as a goal scorer, Hine was also known for his exceptional passing and crossing skills, adding immense value to the team's overall performance. Unfortunately, Ernie Hine's time with the Red Devils was marred by Manchester United's irregular performance which saw the club experiencing both victorious and challenging times. During their dark period, Manchester United found themselves facing relegation from Division One to Division Two during the 1930-1931 season. Hine persisted with the club, and in 1932, the team managed to bounce back and secure a place in Division One. He played for Manchester United until 1934 when he returned back to Notts County F.C. to play out the final years of his career. In conclusion, Ernie Hine was a prominent player for Manchester United, famously known as \\"the Red Devils.\\" He made significant contributions to the club in terms of goals and performances. His dedication, talent, and skillset provided immense value to the team during a turbulent period in their history. Hine remains an important figure in the annals of Manchester United's storied past, and his contributions to the club's legacy are still fondly remembered today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: What does a judge do when someone is convicted of a crime? Here are possible answers to this question: - conduct trial - arrest - bring in verdict - pass sentence - serve justice I believe the correct choice is \\"pass sentence\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"When someone is convicted of a crime, the primary responsibility of a judge is to \\"pass sentence,\\" which involves determining the appropriate punishment for the convicted individual based on the nature of the crime, legal guidelines, and other relevant factors. This choice accurately represents the primary role of a judge at this stage in the criminal justice process. Here's a detailed explanation of why this answer is correct: 1. Conduct trial: While it's true that a judge plays a crucial role in conducting a trial, this answer choice doesn't exactly capture the specific action a judge takes when someone has already been convicted of a crime. The judge's role during the trial is to preside and ensure that due process is followed, but once a conviction occurs, their responsibility shifts to passing sentence. 2. Arrest: The arrest of a suspect is carried out by law enforcement officers, not a judge. A judge might issue an arrest warrant at the request of a prosecutor or the police, which authorizes law enforcement officers to arrest a suspect, but this is separate from sentencing a convicted individual. 3. Bring in verdict: The verdict is typically determined by the jury in a jury trial, or the judge in a bench trial (also known as a trial by judge). The verdict is the final decision on whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty based on the evidence presented during the trial. This stage usually precedes sentencing and is distinct from the judge's role in determining a punishment after a conviction. 4. Pass sentence: This answer choice is the most accurate description of what a judge does when someone is convicted of a crime. The process of passing sentence consists of a judge reviewing the facts of the case, the severity of the crime, relevant laws, and legal guidelines for sentencing. The judge may also consider various factors, such as the defendant's criminal history, character, and potential for rehabilitation. After thorough consideration, the judge determines and pronounces the appropriate punishment for the convicted individual, which could range from fines and community service to probation, imprisonment, or even the death penalty in certain cases. 5. Serve justice: This answer choice is too general to capture the specific action taken by a judge when someone is convicted of a crime. While \\"serving justice\\" might encompass the overall objective of a judge's role in the criminal justice system, it doesn't provide a clear description of the particular action performed by a judge after a conviction. In summary, a judge's primary responsibility when someone is convicted of a crime is to \\"pass sentence,\\" determining the appropriate punishment for the individual based on the specifics of the case, relevant laws, and other factors. This particular action is crucial to ensuring that justice is served and that the convicted person receives a punishment that aligns with established legal norms and societal values."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Thus, we should return an empty list []. This meets the criteria because we are left with no numbers after removing all the numbers divisible by 3. Part #4: Zero is divisible by 3. Usage: Consider the list [0, 9, 81], where 0 is also divisible by 3. After removing the numbers divisible by 3, we are left with an empty list [].

Step 1: Understand the context of the question - The question describes someone who is fiddling through a music book when they should be playing. Step 2: Relate the context to the possible answers - A person's behavior in this scenario can be affected by various factors, such as practice, dexterity, idle time, knowledge of music, and the conductor. Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of each possible answer - Practice: The lack of practice could be a reason for not being able to play properly, making it a relevant answer. - Dexterity: The lack of dexterity could hinder someone's ability to play, making it a relevant answer. - Idle time: Idle time is not directly related to the behavior mentioned in the question and may not be associated with the person's ability to play. - Knowledge of music: Someone who lacks knowledge of music might struggle to play the music correctly and may need to refer to the music book more frequently.

If I didn't bike to work, I'd spend my weekdays almost entirely indoors--underground tunnel. On the bike, I get trees, air and a great way to get to know city neighborhoods. Of course, I also get bad weather and city traffic. But it's worth the trade-off. The weather's not often bad, and rain and snow have their charms. I've been cycling to work since the late 1990s. I started when the city was doing some construction in the subways and rerouting passengers, which would have lengthened my trip considerably. I tried riding my sister- in- law's bike to work one day and liked it, so I bought my own. Even though I hadn't biked since I was a child, I got back into it right away. I bike during all four seasons. In summer, I wear shorts and a T- shirt and carry a messenger bag over my shoulder for my lunch and anything else I need. Once at the office, I change into business- casual clothes. In winter, I wear layers and a thin hat under my helmet. A cold winter day can be the best time to be on a bicycle. When the air is clear, free of oppressive summer haze, the city can look beautiful. Biking to work also _ during the workday itself. I have a rack on the back of my bike that accommodates panniers that allow me to pick up groceries. During work hours, a colleague will occasionally need to send or retrieve documents by messenger.

Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

No Based on the provided context, we cannot conclude that Goyband is also known as Dirty Dancing. The context describes Goyband as an American independent comedy film directed by Christopher Grimm and starring Adam Pascal. The phrase \\"Dirty Dancing meets My Big Fat Greek Wedding with a touch of a hip hop Fiddler on the Roof\\" is used to describe the film's overall feel and atmosphere, rather than being a direct assertion that Goyband is known as Dirty Dancing. While it appears that Goyband might share some stylistic or thematic elements with Dirty Dancing, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and Fiddler on the Roof, we must consider these comparisons as a way of expressing the film's unique blend of genres and themes, rather than a statement indicating that Goyband is a direct counterpart or alternative title to any of these mentioned films.

Answer:","completion":"Without knowing the exact conversation that occurred before this statement, I can only provide a hypothetical reconstruction of the events or discussion that may have led to it. Here's an example of a conversation that precedes the statement \\"She can't. She is fired.\\" In this hypothetical scenario, a group of employees is discussing the work-related tasks and responsibilities of a specific colleague. Let's name the colleague Carol. Carol has been underperforming and causing delays in project completion. Employee A: It looks like we're running behind schedule on the marketing project, largely due to the graphic design component. I think we need to address this issue. Employee B: I agree. The deadline is fast approaching, and we need to find a solution. Carol is responsible for handling the graphic design work. Should we ask her to work overtime to catch up? Employee C: Well, her designs haven't been up to par lately. Maybe we could involve someone from a different team to help her out, and we could offer our suggestions and improvements? Employee A: I'm not sure if that can work. Our manager has been closely monitoring Carol's performance, and it seems like a decision has been made. Employee B: What decision? Is she going to receive additional training or support? Employee A: No, I heard earlier today that she's no longer with the company. I guess our manager couldn't risk the project's success or the team's overall performance. So, as of now, she can't work on the project anymore. She is fired. From this example, you can infer that the conversation prior to the statement \\"She can't. She is fired.\\" revolved around the concerns and challenges faced by the team due to an underperforming member's impact on a project and the subsequent revelation that the team member has already been terminated from the company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Mr. Lessig, on your First Amendment argument I don't see where the retroactivity-prospectivity comes in, because -- I follow your argument under the Copyright Clause, but if you're saying that the time is too long, the public domain should get this stuff sooner rather than later, would you explain to me how your prospectivity-retrospective line fits into your First Amendment claim? Hypothesis: Lessig has talked to clinton","completion":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is true, I will first analyze the paragraph given in the prompt, then justify the steps based on the content of the paragraph. Step 1: Analyze the given paragraph The paragraph consists of a question directed towards a person called Mr. Lessig. The question is asking Mr. Lessig to explain how the prospectivity-retrospective line fits into his First Amendment claim, and it is related to lessig's argument concerning the Copyright Clause, but it does not mention anything about a conversation between Lessig and Clinton. Step 2: Relate the Hypothesis to the Paragraph The hypothesis suggests that Lessig has talked to Clinton. However, there is no mention of Clinton in the paragraph provided. The only information available in the paragraph is a question asking Mr. Lessig to elaborate on his First Amendment argument. Step 3: Determine the Truth Value of the Hypothesis Based on the information given in the paragraph, there is no evidence or indication that Lessig has talked to Clinton. Since there is no information supporting the hypothesis, and the paragraph is only about the question asked to Lessig regarding his First Amendment claim, thus I cannot establish if the hypothesis is true. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the paragraph, I cannot determine if the hypothesis \\"Lessig has talked to Clinton\\" is true, because there is no information that connects Lessig to Clinton in the paragraph provided."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This exciting news has drawn the world's attention, and it is a symbol of the ever-evolving British monarchy. As the nation prepares for the highly anticipated celebration, we take a closer look at the couple's relationship and what we can expect from this transatlantic union. A Whirlwind Romance The couple began dating last year and despite the challenges of a long-distance relationship, with Prince Harry in the United Kingdom and Meghan Markle in Toronto, their love has only grown stronger. They made their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games in Toronto in September, and rumors of a royal engagement were quick to follow. In a statement from Kensington Palace, it was announced that the couple became engaged in London earlier this month. Prince Harry has already informed his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and other close members of his family. The palace also confirmed that Prince Harry sought and received the blessing of Meghan Markle’s parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, who are delighted by the engagement. A Spring Wedding While many details surrounding the wedding are yet to be disclosed, NBC News reports that the royal nuptials will take place in the spring of 2018. The wedding venue has not been revealed, but Kensington Palace has assured the public that more information will be released in \\"due course.\\" This marks a new chapter in the British monarchy's history — a union between a British prince and an American bride. The Bride-to-Be Meghan Markle, 36, grew up in the Los Angeles area. She is best known for her role as Rachel Zane in the popular TV series \\"Suits.\\" In addition to her acting career, Markle is an outspoken advocate for gender equality and a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, working to help improve the lives of children around the world. Her parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, released a statement expressing their joy for their daughter’s engagement, saying, \\"Meghan has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents.\\" Interestingly, one of Markle’s ancestors was beheaded almost 500 years ago on the orders of one of Prince Harry's forebears. From Toronto to London Following their marriage, the couple will reside in London, contrary to initial speculation that they might settle in Toronto, where Ms. Markle is currently based. Prince Harry, 33, is fifth in line to the British throne, and this move will signify the beginning of Meghan Markle's new life as a member of the British royal family. Conclusion This royal wedding marks a significant moment in the history of the British monarchy, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's love story transcends borders and captures the hearts of millions around the world. As we eagerly await the spring nuptials, their union serves as a testament to the power of love and the ever-evolving nature of the esteemed British monarchy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Revolver Movie plot: Jake Green (Jason Statham) is in prison in solitary confinement for seven years. He has two mysterious characters serving solitary in cells on either side of him (one a con man, the other a chess master). While in solitary, Jake and the other two exchange thoughts on chess and the perfect con via handwritten messages slipped inside of provisional books that the three share. Jake comes to learn the makings of a perfect con, but never fully grasps its depth and relevancy to him until much, much later. In the course of these exchanges, Jake reveals a lot about himself to the other two. Jake never meets these two men face to face. The two prisoners plan to break out of prison and agree to break Jake out as well. The next day, the two escape, leaving Jake behind. He feels cheated.Jake remains in prison while the two escaped convicts steal all the money Jake had hidden \\"on the outside\\". They trusted Jake with the formula; Jake trusted them as to the whereabouts of his money...a LOT of money. They take the money, leaving in its place, a message on a card:The first rule of any game - YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.Cut to two years later.When Jake gets out of prison, broke and penniless, he starts to practice what he understands of the formula and of the con he learned from his time in solitary. Its very successful and he does very well in world of gambling, he seemingly learned a valuable lesson from the two conmen inside.Once Jake is up on his feet again (financially speaking), he takes on his nemesis the power hungry Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta). Jake enters Macha's casino with his brothers in tow, and is swiftly summoned before Macha to play a game of chance. En route to Macha's game, they must take an elevator up 22 floors, where it is revealed Jake suffers from extreme claustrophobia following his years in solitary, and must suppress an anxiety attack to make the journey. At the game, Jake beats him in a game of chance, humiliating Macha. Fearing more of the same, Macha wants revenge and... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Revolver,\\" the three Eddies are not explicitly sent to Billy's house by one single character, but rather, their presence at his house can be attributed to the series of events and manipulations orchestrated by the two mysterious characters in prison, Mr. Gold, and ultimately by the nature of the con itself. These characters enable the chain of events that eventually lead the Eddies to Billy's house. As the movie unfolds, it becomes clear that the larger con is not just about teaching Jake a lesson or taking his money, but also about revealing deeper truths about his own instincts, motivations, and fears. The complexities within this con make it difficult to pinpoint one character responsible for the Eddies' presence at Billy's house because this outcome is an inevitable part of the ongoing manipulation and power struggles between all the players involved. When the two mysterious prisoners escape and take Jake's money, they unknowingly trigger a thirst for vengeance and retribution within Jake. As he embarks on his journey to play Dorothy Macha, he's inadvertently playing into the bigger con orchestrated by these characters. The deeper he gets, the more entangled with crime lords, hired killers, and loan sharks he becomes, which increases the probability of encountering dangerous individuals like the three Eddies. Furthermore, Mr. Gold, the underlying antagonist representing the deceptive nature of power and control within the movie, can also be seen as responsible for the Eddies' presence in Billy's house. As Jake continues to play the con, he unknowingly allows Mr. Gold's hold on him to strengthen, furthering the chaos and unpredictability of the situation. Therefore, it's not a single, identifiable character who sends the three Eddies to Billy's house; rather, it's the intricate web of manipulation, desire for power, and human emotion that the entire con is built upon. Their presence is a result of the escalating chain of events and is fueled by the mind games played between the central characters in the story. In conclusion, while the three Eddies' arrival at Billy's house is not the direct doing of a single character, it is made possible by the combined machinations of the main players. Their presence is a consequence of the ongoing con, mind games, and power struggles in the complex world of \\"Revolver.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Bronn do in his translation that went completely against what Darwin wanted in On the Origin of Species?","completion":"Heinrich Georg Bronn's translation of Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" into German went against Darwin's intentions in several ways: 1. Imposing his own ideas: Bronn introduced his own interpretations and ideas into the translation, going beyond his role as a translator and effectively modifying Darwin's original text. This included the addition of controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately left out or chosen not to discuss in-depth. 2. Altering phrases and concepts: Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races,\\" which potentially skewed the meaning of Darwin's original work. This change could have suggested a greater degree of finality and superiority in certain species, which was not in line with Darwin's emphasis on the constant process of natural selection and adaptation. 3. Adding essays and chapters: Bronn's translation included essays on topics such as the origin of life and the religious implications of Darwin's theory. These additions were partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie, a philosophical approach that applied metaphysical principles to the study of nature. These essays were not part of Darwin's original work and introduced new ideas that Darwin may not have agreed with or wanted to include. 4. Second edition issues: Although Bronn produced a second German edition based on the third English edition and included Darwin's suggested additions, he passed away shortly after its publication due to a heart attack. This left the German translation in a potentially unpolished state and may have resulted in inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the text. In summary, Bronn went against Darwin's intentions in his translation of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" by introducing his own ideas and themes, altering concepts and phrases, and adding essays and chapters not present in the original work. This led to a German translation that deviated significantly from Darwin's intended meaning and subsequently required revisions in later editions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lesbian pulp fiction was published in the 1950s and 60s by many of the same paperback publishing houses that other genres of fiction including westerns, romances, and detective fiction. Because very little other literature was available for and about lesbians at this time, quite often these books were the only reference the public (lesbian and otherwise) had for modeling what lesbians were. Stephanie Foote, from the University of Illinois commented on the importance of lesbian pulp novels to the lesbian identity prior to feminism: \\"Pulps have been understood as signs of a secret history of readers, and they have been valued because they have been read. The more they are read, the more they are valued, and the more they are read, the closer the relationship between the very act of circulation and reading and the construction of a lesbian community becomes...Characters use the reading of novels as a way to understand that they are not alone.\\" - Sebastian Charles Faulks CBE (born 20 April 1953) is a British novelist, journalist and broadcaster.

The character first appeared in 1930. The books are ghostwritten by a number of authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes. The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs and to eliminate racist stereotypes, with arguable success. In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less assertive and more feminine. In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, \\"The Nancy Drew Files\\", that included romantic subplots for the sleuth. The original \\"Nancy Drew Mystery Stories\\" series started in 1930, and ended in 2004.

Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.

Może być to coś, co przypomina taką amebę.","completion":"What this task is asking: You're asked to translate a sentence written in Polish into English. Guidelines given: You haven't been given specific guidelines about how to do this translation. However, translating sentences generally involves understanding the meaning of the sentence as a whole, rather than translating word-by-word. It's useful to understand the context in which the sentence is used. Solution: The English translation of the Polish sentence \\"Może być to coś, co przypomina taką amebę.\\" is \\"It can be something that resembles such an amoeba.\\" Explanation of the process: In order to provide the translation, I used my knowledge of Polish grammar and vocabulary. Sentence by sentence translation was done to ensure the accuracy of the meaning and intention of the sentence. The words were translated individually while keeping an eye on the overall context to make sure the sentence flows naturally in English. Polish grammar rules are different from those in English, so I also adjusted the sentence structure to match English norms. For example, in Polish, the adjective \\"taką\\" comes after the noun it describes \\"amebę\\", whereas in English we would usually put the adjective (in this case \\"such\\") before the noun it describes \\"an amoeba\\". Hence the translated English sentence \\"It can be something that resembles such an amoeba.\\" makes sense in English."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So the woman on the table next to me looks awfully familiar , but I ca n't place her until I hear here talking to the therapist about skating and rink time and all that . Answer the following question: Why did I think the woman was familiar ?","completion":"Step 1: Read and understand the user's story. In the given story, the user is at physical therapy and mentions that everyone works in the same big room. They also mention the atmosphere is friendly, and patients chat with each other during exercises. The user then talks about a woman on the next table who looks familiar, but they can't place her until they hear her discussing skating and rink time. Step 2: Identify key information from the story. The key information in this story is that the user thought the woman was familiar and eventually recognized her based on her conversation about skating and rink time. Step 3: Connect the key information to the question. The question asks why the user thought the woman was familiar. The story mentions that the user recognized the woman after hearing her talk about skating and rink time. Step 4: Formulate a justified answer. Based on the information from the story, it can be concluded that the user thought the woman was familiar because they had probably seen or interacted with her in a context related to skating or at the rink. The conversation about skating and rink time triggered the recognition for the user, making the woman's face familiar to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question \\"Why did Jesse do this?\\", is \\"wanted to survive\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"wanted to survive\\" is a valid answer as to why Jesse desperately grasped onto Addison's hand when Jesse slipped on the edge of the volcano. However, this response alone is quite limited and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of all the possible reasons behind Jesse's actions and the emotions tied to the situation. Firstly, Jesse's instinctual response was to seek assistance when faced with a potentially life-threatening situation. Human beings have an innate survival instinct that drives them to preserve their own lives in the face of danger. In this case, Jesse's realization of the perilous situation they were in led them to instinctively reach out to Addison for help, knowing that their friend could provide a source of stability to prevent them from falling. Secondly, aside from the physical need to survive, Jesse could also have been driven by emotional motivations. Friendships and connections with others play a crucial role in how people respond to adversity. Jesse, having a personal bond with Addison, may have felt a sense of trust and assurance that seeking help from their friend was the right course of action. This emotional connection not only explains Jesse's desperation in grasping Addison's hand but also serves to strengthen the bond and trust between the two friends. Furthermore, Jesse's action could have been a testament to the importance of teamwork, which can prove essential in overcoming challenges and dangerous situations. Jesse's desperate grasp may emphasize the significance of relying on others, showing a willingness to acknowledge that no individual can overcome every obstacle on their own. By reaching out to Addison, Jesse is exhibiting a strong sense of humility and trust in their friend's ability to step in and provide support during a life-threatening crisis. Lastly, this event can serve as a reminder of the vulnerability and fragility of life. Jesse's reliance on Addison in such a critical moment illustrates the delicate balance between life and death and the need for personal connections and strength in the face of adversity. In summary, \\"wanted to survive\\" is indeed a valid answer but does not encompass the multitude of factors contributing to Jesse's decision to grasp onto Addison's hand while slipping on the edge of the volcano."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of gumballs that can fit in the box. The box has dimensions of 10\\" x 10\\" x 10\\", which gives it a maximum volume of 1,000 cubic inches (10 x 10 x 10).

Using the highest guess provided (Jeff's guess of 800 gumballs) as an estimate, let's assume there were originally 800 gumballs in the box. Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs missing. We know that 100 people guessed and took a gumball each, so 100 gumballs are missing from the box. Given this analysis, the response \\"100\\" correctly answers the question \\"Roughly how many gumballs are missing?\\" We can assume that there were approximately 800 gumballs originally in the box, and 100 gumballs were taken out by people who have guessed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor. In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \\"Gold Teeth\\" had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Sydney in 1952 and returning from a month away, the private investigator Reilly finds his office has been taken over by the building's janitor, Jerry Vane, who has been impersonating him in his absence. Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired. Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later, a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette's wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs â leaving him even more confused. Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi. Later, Reilly gives Vane a camera and instructs him to follow Arnett and take photos of anything that appears interesting. Meanwhile, he drives to the Pleshette mansion on Noir Drive to confront Alex. She concedes that although she was bitter towards her husband as a result of the fraud... The answer to this question is:","completion":"What prompts Reilly to suspect Gabe Preston as the possible murderer of Donald Pleshette and what alibi does Preston have to prove his innocence?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The OPT: - avalanche had ceased to be dangerous.; - earthquake had ceased to be dangerous.;","completion":"The two natural disasters seemed to have reached their respective peaks, and although the avalanche continued its chaotic descent down the mountain, triggering even more chaos, the earthquake's tremors had noticeably diminished, leaving the surrounding environment in relative calm. However, the avalanche, having lost most of its destructive momentum, was now slowing to a halt, covering the once-pristine landscape in a thick blanket of snow and ice. Similarly, the earthquake, which had caused catastrophic damage to infrastructure and left deep fissures in the earth, had finally come to an end, allowing the affected residents to breathe a sigh of relief and cautiously begin assessing the extent of the devastation. Surprisingly, as both of these calamities had ceased to pose an imminent threat to the inhabitants in the area, they offered a peculiar opportunity for scientists and disaster management experts to gain invaluable insights into the aftermath of such cataclysms. Following the initial wave of panic and anxiety, several teams of experts were deployed to conduct thorough studies of the affected regions and collect crucial data on the impacts of these massive forces of nature. In the case of the avalanche, environmentalists were eager to investigate the implications this could have on local wildlife, flora, and ecosystems. With numerous habitats buried under the relentless torrent of snow, the potential effects on those species inhabiting the mountain slopes required immediate attention. Furthermore, this avalanche served as a stark reminder of the consequences of climate change, which is becoming increasingly apparent worldwide in the form of unpredictable weather and natural disasters. On the other hand, the earthquake presented seismologists with a chance to analyze the tectonic activities in the region, helping to forecast future seismic events and potentially save lives by being better prepared. Similarly, architects and engineers were given valuable information to create more earthquake-resistant infrastructure, utilizing novel design concepts and innovative materials. Although the avalanche and earthquake had ceased to be dangerous, they provided both the opportunity and impetus for collaboration between various disciplines, from landscape management to structural engineering. The disaster-stricken area acted as a canvas upon which groundbreaking research could be conducted to reduce the long-lasting effects of such calamities on both society and the environment. In the end, it can be said that the cessation of both the avalanche and earthquake's destructive acts marked the beginning of a new phase – a phase grounded in research and rehabilitation efforts. While they had been dangerous forces that left chaos and devastation in their wake, they also served as a reminder of the power of nature, the importance of preparedness, and the resilience of humankind in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"wooden table\\" and \\"grass\\". The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the factors that affect the warming of the toy car's tires. Step 1: Identify the friction between the surfaces - Friction is the force that opposes the motion between two surfaces in contact. It generates heat as objects move against each other. - The wooden table has a smooth surface, which would have less friction than the irregular surface of the grass. Step 2: Analyze the effect of friction on tire warming - When an object is pushed across a surface, friction generates heat. The more friction between the surfaces, the more heat generated. Step 3: Compare the friction between the wooden table and grass - We've established that there is less friction between the toy car and wooden table than between the toy car and grass. Step 4: Determine which surface results in warmer tires - Since there is more friction between the toy car and grass, more heat is generated when the toy car is pushed over the grass. Therefore, the tires of the toy car would get more warm when it is pushed over the grass. The answer is: grass."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy.

Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error.

He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard.

Choose from: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"B. Yes While the phrasing of the two questions is slightly different, they both essentially ask whether Donald Trump is similar to Andrew Jackson. When comparing historical figures, it is natural to look for similarities and differences in various aspects of their lives and political careers. Here is an analysis of both presidents, which may offer some context for understanding their similarities: 1. Personality traits: Both Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson are known for their strong personalities. Jackson was a fierce and polarizing figure whose assertiveness and unwillingness to compromise earned him the nickname \\"Old Hickory.\\" Similarly, Trump is known for his combative leadership style and controversial statements. 2. Political outsiders: Both Jackson and Trump can be seen as \\"political outsiders\\" who challenged the status quo. Jackson was the first \\"self-made\\" president, rising to prominence based on his military exploits rather than political lineage. Trump also presented himself as a political outsider, a successful businessman who took on established politicians. 3. Populism: Both presidents embraced populist ideologies, championing the cause of \\"the common man\\" against an entrenched elite. Jackson vehemently opposed elitism and the influence of powerful financial interests, such as the Bank of the United States. Similarly, Trump campaigned on promises to \\"drain the swamp\\" and give voice to forgotten Americans. 4. Controversial policies: Both presidents implemented controversial policies. Jackson's treatment of Native Americans, particularly the Indian Removal Act and the subsequent Trail of Tears, remains a dark spot on American history. Trump has also faced criticism for a number of his policies, notably his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, and the separation of children from their families at the Mexican border. 5. Media and communication: Both leaders showed a keen sense of engaging with their supporters directly. Jackson was the first president to extensively utilize newspapers to communicate with the public and influence public opinion. Trump is known for his avid use of social media, especially Twitter, to bypass traditional media outlets and connect directly with his followers. It's important to note that while there are some striking parallels between both presidents, there are also significant differences in their political philosophies, personal backgrounds, and the historical contexts in which they governed. However, the central inquiry in both questions—is there a likeness between the two men in terms of their political personas and actions—essentially remains the same. Therefore, the answer is (B) Yes, as both questions have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

In the sentence \\"This is only the beginning,\\" \\"this\\" is a pronoun, \\"is\\" is the linking verb, \\"only\\" is an adverb, \\"the\\" is a definite article, and \\"beginning\\" is a noun. Step 2: Recognize the sentence structure. The sentence has a subject (\\"this\\") and a predicate (\\"is only the beginning\\"). It is a simple, declarative sentence with no complex elements, so the translation should reflect this simplicity. Step 3: Translate individual words while considering grammar rules. In Romanian, \\"this\\" can be translated as \\"acesta\\" (masculine) or \\"aceasta\\" (feminine).

Paul Gambaccini is to return to BBC radio after he was cleared of historic allegations of sex abuse. The veteran broadcaster, who spent almost a year on police bail, will be in the studio on Friday to record a new edition of his Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint. The presenter, 65, will then return to his popular weekly Radio 2 show on Saturday November 14. Paul Gambaccini, who has spent almost a year on police bail, will return to the BBC radio studios on Friday. The BBC has so far made no comment about the presenter’s future and declined to comment last night. But one source who asked not to be named said: ‘Paul will be returning to both of the shows. ‘He will be in the studio on Friday to record Counterpoint and he will also record the subsequent heats. The taping on Friday is for broadcast at a later date but he will be back on Radio 2 next month.’ The DJ was arrested in October last year as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate historic sex abuse cases. Mr Gambaccini was accused of sexually assaulting two teenage boys in the 1980s. He has always protested his innocence but agreed to step down from presenting duties while police pursued their inquiries. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck was also arrested and released without charge as part of the operation. After his arrest in 2013 he compared his treatment to the musical The Scottsboro Boys which he had just seen. ‘It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences,’ he said. ‘Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.’ Mr Gambaccini’s ordeal ended earlier this month when the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against him and an unidentified 75-year-old man who was arrested on the same day. The police’s treatment of the broadcaster and in particular the amount of time he spent on bail and unable to work has raised fresh concerns about the Operation Yewtree. Mr Gambaccini was the 15th person arrested as part of the operation and one of ten released without charge. Critics of the inquiry have branded it a witch hunt. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, who was also arrested and released without charge, has called for accusers in sex assault cases to lose their anonymity. Mr Gambaccini has so far declined to talk in depth about what he has described as ‘an horrific ordeal.’ In a statement he said: ‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected.’ Mr Gambaccini, who entered into a civil partnership with actor Christopher Sherwood in 2012, has hosted Counterpoint since 2008. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Paul Gambaccini is a man who talks on the radio about music and he had to take a break from his radio shows for a while because some people said he did something very bad a long time ago. But after the police looked into what happened, they found out that he didn't do anything wrong. So, now he's allowed to go back to his radio shows on BBC Radio, where he shares interesting things about music with his listeners. Everyone is happy that he's back on the radio, and Paul is excited to be able to talk about music with his friends again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation. Question: \\"What is the total amount for the grants and how are they to be used?\\" Response: \\"Grants totaled 7 million dollars and are to be used for paying 6.6 million for staffing and the remainder for technology\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

The Welsh team demonstrated unparalleled determination and grit as they clawed their way back into the game, eventually claiming a monumental victory that will reverberate through the annals of Rugby history. As the highly anticipated match commenced, the home side, England, were off to a dominant start, rapidly mounting a 10-point lead against their opponents. Buoyed by the cheers of the Twickenham crowd, it looked as if England was well on its way to a comfortable victory. However, the mighty Welsh side, renowned for their resilience and fighting spirit, had other plans in store. Wales launched an inspiring comeback, much to the delight of their supporters, with flanker Dan Lydiate securing a crucial turnover just before halftime. The ferocious fightback was truly set in motion when fly-half Dan Biggar converted a record-breaking penalty from 50 meters out – his longest ever successful kick in a test match. This act of sheer audacity narrowed the point-gap and underlined Biggar's significance to the Welsh team's success. The momentum appeared to switch in favor of the Welsh side as they continued to chip away at the English lead. This culminated in a tremendous team effort as scrum-half Gareth Davies scored the game-tying try in the 71st minute, taking full advantage of an English handling error. Then, just moments later, it was Biggar who stepped up under immense pressure to deliver yet another record-breaking penalty and secure a famous win for his nation. \\"Sorry\\" was the only word uttered from a stunned English Captain, Chris Robshaw, as he shook his Welsh counterpart's hand at the end of the game. His crestfallen teammates, who had felt victory within their grasp, could only watch on as Wales savored their hard-earned triumph. While the Welsh performance was undeniably heroic, this landmark victory did not come without considerable obstacles, as injuries to key players threatened to derail their momentum. However, in true Welsh fashion, the players called up to fill the void responded with exceptional performances of their own, demonstrating the depth of talent within the squad. English fans, on the other hand, saw their World Cup dreams hang in the balance as their team's position within Group A became increasingly precarious. In contrast, the jubilant Welsh fans now appeared to have a renewed sense of hope as they celebrated their astonishing victory. The outcome of this thrilling contest stands testament to the unpredictability and sheer excitement of Rugby at the highest level. Wales' astounding fightback showcased not only their immense skill and guile but also their unyielding heart and refusal to accept defeat. This will undoubtedly go down as one of the most memorable matches in World Cup history, and the Welsh side will be eager to carry this momentum forward as they face their upcoming challenges. In conclusion, Wales' extraordinary win over England was an unforgettable display of courage and tenacity that turned the tide of World Cup Group A. The nail-biting, comeback victory for Wales left both sets of fans on the edge of their seats, cementing the match's status as an instant classic in the annals of Rugby World Cup folklore."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If less condom use occurs, it will likely result in more babies being born. This is because condoms are one of the most widely used and effective methods of contraception, offering not only protection from unwanted pregnancies but also from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To understand the impact of less condom usage on the number of babies being born, let's look at the process you described, and how a decrease in condom usage can lead to a higher number of pregnancies: 1. When sperm meets an egg in the uterus of a woman, fertilization occurs, leading to the formation of a zygote. Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, prevent sperm from reaching the egg, resulting in lesser chances of fertilization. 2. With less condom usage, more sperm would come into contact with eggs, increasing the likelihood of fertilization and the formation of a zygote. 3. The increased number of zygotes, resulting from a larger number of fertilized eggs, would lead to the development of more fetuses, and ultimately, more babies being born. 4. As the number of babies born increases, there would be an increased need for parental care, resources, and time spent raising these children. This could place additional stress on families and society as a whole. 5. With a growing population, there may be increased competition for jobs, educational opportunities, and resources, which could affect economic conditions and social dynamics. 6. Relationships, marriages, and social interactions may also be shaped by the higher number of people, potentially leading to different relationship and family dynamics. 7. As the population ages, there might be a larger number of retirees, placing additional strain on social welfare systems, healthcare, and other support systems. 8. Eventually, as the larger population passes away, there could be an impact on healthcare resources, funeral services, and even environmental considerations, such as the amount of space needed for burials. In summary, less condom usage can have a significant effect on the number of babies being born, ultimately leading to more babies. This increased number of births and a growing population can influence various aspects of society, such as parental care, job availability, economic conditions, and various social and environmental factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brian loved putting together model cars while Ian did not because","completion":"he simply lacked the patience and attention to detail that the hobby required. Nonetheless, the two friends spent ample time together in Brian's garage, which had morphed into a spectacular miniature car showroom over time. Brian was now on a mission to assemble his most ambitious project to date – a highly detailed and accurate model of a 1967 Shelby Cobra. He'd been saving up for this model for a year and was immensely excited to begin working on it. Ian, though not particularly fond of model cars, found Brian's passion infectious and offered to lend a hand. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon when they began their work. Brian's garage was filled with the ambient sound of raindrops pelting the metal roof. The two were stationed at a large wooden workbench cluttered with all the necessary tools, with Brian meticulously studying the assembly instructions. Ian marveled at the intricacy of each part, observing as Brian sliced open plastic bags filled with meticulously crafted chrome pieces, cloth wiring, and miniature screws. The sheer level of detail was impressive – more like a scaled-down real car than a mere model. For the first few hours, Ian simply observed and handed tools to Brian when needed. They chatted about the usual things: school, friends, and their plans for the summer. Occasionally, Brian would catch Ian zoning out, staring blankly at the complex assembly at hand, overwhelmed by the thousands of pieces that made up the model. But he admired his friend's dedication to something he lacked interest in and made an effort to be patient and engage Ian in the complicated process of building the model. As they continued their work, they discovered that Ian had an uncanny ability to find the perfect song for every stage of construction. He threw together a killer playlist that combined classic rock, blues, and orchestral works, which turned out to be the perfect motivation for the tedious task at hand. Time slipped away quickly in the garage, as the two poured their passion and focus into assembling the model car. Despite some initial hesitations, Ian quickly improved his skills – learning to differentiate between the various types of screws, applying the tiniest of decals, and even customizing small details in the engine compartment. The experience served as a bond-strengthening glue between the two friends. After working on the model for days, they finally reached the last step: the paint job. They decided to honor the original design of the '67 Shelby Cobra and go for a classic blue with twin white racing stripes. The two spent hours carefully masking, painting, and then polishing the model car until it shone under the garage lights. Exhausted from the long process, they stood back and admired the fruits of their labor. Brian couldn't help but marvel at how much his friend had learned and grown through this shared hobby. Ian, on the other hand, realized that while model car building might never be his favorite pastime, he now understood and respected the amount of passion, time, and effort that went into it. As they closed up the garage and headed back to reality, they knew that they had not only created something beautiful but forged a deeper friendship in the process. And beyond that, Ian had gained the life lesson of never underestimating the power of passion, regardless of its chosen outlet. That lesson would stay with him throughout his life, reminding him that there is virtue in pursuing one's passion, in the company and support of friends, and in the value of taking the time to understand the intricacies of life's small pleasures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
