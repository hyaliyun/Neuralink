The specific contextual information given tells us a number of key details. First, it tells us that 'Mary Poppins Returns' had its world premiere in Los Angeles, California at the Dolby and El Capitan Theatres on November 29, 2018. The context also informs us that several well-known actors, including Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Dick Van Dyke and more, were present at this premiere. Most importantly, we know from the context that 'Mary Poppins Returns' is a sequel to the 1964 Disney classic. However, the context does not provide us with any specific information about any prior sequels. There is no mention of, or allusion to, any films that were made as follow-ups to the original 1964 film prior to 'Mary Poppins Returns'. Thus, we cannot draw the hypothesis that it was not the first sequel. Any conclusion about other possible sequels, or the order in which they were made, would be purely speculative and not based on the information provided in the context. To accurately draw conclusions or form hypotheses from a text, we must stick closely to the information as it is presented.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : This is kinda long but has important details TL:DR at the bottom So I’m decently skilled with cars and engines. I love watching toturials and learning about cars and bikes, I’ve taken a few classes and a very close friend who is a mechanic helps me out with questions or any problems I have. But by no means am I professional. A lot of my friends when they learn this ask me to do work for them, the times I have they either offer me money upfront or after I do the work they ask how much they owe me. I don’t charge much and could even say I charge a lot less then local shops (I do all this at my house) Also important note. I don’t charge people for referring them to skilled mechanics for certain problems their car has that I can’t fix or don’t have the tools for. Also I don’t charge for looking up pr looking for parts. Never have. So one friend of mine we’ll call her T (because I’m drinking tea rn) learned about my mechanic skills over last summer. She asked if I could work on her car. I said sure, asked her what the problem was. She wanted her speakers replaced, a total brake job, oil change, oil filter and a few other small things. The speakers are the worst for me because I hate wiring. But we had been friends for a long time so I said sure. I helped her track down all the parts she’d need, and everything came to about 400 she lowered the proce by buying extremely cheap speakers from China. I told her it would take me about a weekend to do the car because of everything. I brought up id be charging her for it and she asked rudlet how much? I told her I’d do everything for 200 which in my opinion is really good for everything promised. She got really upset and said her bf wpuld do the speakers. Yet he always made excuses not to. I told her that this was a whole weekend of free time being used and I thought I deserved something for doing it. She tried throwing the we’ve been friends for so long card but I said no. She didn’t talk to me for 2 months. About a month ago we were hanging out and her front bumper and the front end were MANGLED mostly held together by duct tape. She told me she lost control in a snow storm and hit something. She asked if I could help fix it. I said sure the bumper for her car was mounted by brackets and we could probably get one at a scrap yard or offline. She wanted a scrap yard even though the colors most likley wouldn’t be the same. She also asked me to change her headlights and get new lenses for them. I felt bad and told her I’d do all that for 100 and even had spare headlights she could use so she didn’t have to buy them. She called that bullshit and left. We’ve barley talked since and she even bad mouthed me for that to my girlfriend. So AITA should I have done the work at least once for free?

A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km), travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and are up to 45 feet (14 metres) high.A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as refraction - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography. As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale. Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first....

Answer the following question: What was the last name of the person Cobain told that he should just re-cord the record and do the same thing they did last year? Answer the above question based on the context below: After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\" However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound. During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong. The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\" The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'

(Associated Press) The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, is seen on a tarmac at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, Tuesday, July 9, 2013. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (Associated Press) In this photo provided by the National Transportation Safety Board, on Tuesday, July 9, 2013, Investigator in Charge Bill English, foreground, and NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman discuss the progress... (Associated Press) Chairwoman Deborah Hersman also revealed that the pilots told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed during final approach, which prompts questions about whether a mistake was made in programming the \\"autothrottle\\" or if the equipment malfunctioned. The plane crashed when it came in too low and slow for landing. Hersman said the pilot at the controls was only about halfway through his training on the Boeing 777 and was landing that type of aircraft at the San Francisco airport for the first time ever. And the co-pilot was on his first trip as a flight instructor. Saturday's crash killed two people but remarkably 305 others survived, most with little or no physical injuries. A final determination on the cause of the crash is months away and Hersman cautioned against drawing any conclusions based on the information revealed so far. Audio recordings show pilots tried to correct the plane's speed and elevation only until seconds before hitting the seawall at the end of the runway, a calamitous impact that sent the fuselage bouncing and skidding across the airfield. Here is what is known: Seven seconds before impact, someone in the cockpit asked for more speed after apparently noticing that the jet was flying far slower than its recommended landing speed. A few seconds later, the yoke began to vibrate violently, an automatic warning telling the pilot the plane is losing lift and in imminent danger of an aerodynamic stall. One and a half seconds before impact came a command to abort the landing. The plane's airspeed has emerged as a key question mark in the investigation. All aircraft have minimum safe flying speeds that must be maintained or pilots risk a stall, which robs a plane of the lift it needs to stay airborne. Below those speeds, planes become unmaneuverable. Because pilots, not the control tower, are responsible for the approach and landing, former NTSB Chairman James Hall said, the cockpit communications will be key to figuring out what went wrong. \\"Good communication with the flight crew as well as the flight attendants is something I'm sure they're going to look at closely with this event,\\" he said Tuesday. \\"Who was making decisions?\\" Hall was on the transportation board when a Korean Airlines Boeing 747 crashed in Guam in 1997, an accident investigators blamed in part on an authoritarian cockpit culture that made newer pilots reluctant to challenge captains. Since then, the industry has adopted broad training and requirements for crew resource management, a communications system or philosophy airline pilots are taught in part so that pilots who not at the controls feel free to voice any safety concerns or correct any unsafe behavior, even if it means challenging a more senior pilot or saying something that might give offense. If any of the Asiana pilots \\"saw something out of parameters for a safe landing,\\" they were obligated to speak up, said Cass Howell, an associate dean at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. \\"There are dozens and dozens of accidents that were preventable had someone been able to speak up when they should have, but they were reluctant to do so for any number of reasons, including looking stupid or offending the captain,\\" said Howell, a former Marine Corps pilot. There's been no indication, from verbal calls or mechanical issues, that an emergency was ever declared by pilots. Most airlines would require all four pilots to be present for the landing, the time when something is most likely to go wrong, experienced pilots said. \\"If there are four pilots there, even if you are sitting on a jump seat, that's something you watch, the airspeed and the descent profile,\\" said John Cox, a former US Airways pilot and former Air Line Pilots Association accident investigator. Investigators want to nail down exactly what all four Asiana pilots were doing at all times. \\"We're looking at what they were doing, and we want to understand why they were doing it,.\\" Hersman said Monday. \\"We want to understand what they knew and what they understood.\\" It's unlikely there was a lot of chatter as the plane came in. The Federal Aviation Administration's \\"sterile cockpit\\" rules require pilots to refrain from any unnecessary conversation while the plane is below 10,000 feet so that their attention is focused on taking off or landing. What little conversation takes places is supposed to be necessary to safely completing the task at hand. Choi Jeong-ho, a senior official for South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, told reporters in a briefing Tuesday in South Korea that investigators from both countries questioned two of the four Asiana pilots, Lee Gang-guk and Lee Jeong-min, on Monday. They planned to question the other two pilots and air controllers Tuesday. Choi said recorded conversation between the pilots and air controllers at the San Francisco airport would be investigated, too. In addition, authorities were reviewing the initial rescue efforts after fire officials acknowledged that one of their trucks might have run over one of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the crash. The students, Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, were part of a larger group headed for a Christian summer camp with dozens of classmates. Asiana President Yoon Young-doo arrived in San Francisco from South Korea on Tuesday morning, fighting his way through a pack of journalists outside customs. He said he will look at the efforts of airline employees to help injured passengers and their family members, visit with the NTSB and other organizations to apologize for the crash and try to meet injured passengers. Yoon said he can't meet with the Asiana pilots because no outside contact with them is allowed until the investigation is completed. More than 180 people aboard the plane went to hospitals with injuries. But remarkably, more than a third didn't even require hospitalization. The passengers included 141 Chinese, 77 South Koreans, 64 Americans, three Canadians, three Indians, one Japanese, one Vietnamese and one person from France. South Korea officials said 39 people remained hospitalized in seven different hospitals in San Francisco. The flight originated in Shanghai, China, and stopped over in Seoul, South Korea, before making the nearly 11-hour trip to San Francisco. ___ Associated Press writers Jason Dearen, Terry Collins, Paul Elias, Lisa Leff and Sudhin Thanawala in San Francisco and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul also contributed to this report. ||||| The pilot who was in charge of the flight that crashed at the San Francisco airport was making his first trip as an instructor, overseeing a pilot who was still in training on the Boeing 777 and at the controls, investigators said Tuesday. The disclosure came after the National Transportation Safety Board interviewed three of the four pilots who were on Asiana Airlines Flight 214 during Sunday's accident, which killed two teenagers. The fourth, who was in the cabin at the time, was being interviewed Tuesday. It was also revealed that two flight attendants were ejected from the rear of the plane, but survived, National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman Deborah Hersman said at a Tuesday evening briefing. There were four pilots on board Flight 214 because it was a trip of more than 10 hours across the Pacific Ocean from Seoul, South Korea. The pilot at the controls, identified by the airline as Lee Kang-kuk, was still in training on the Boeing 777. He had had 43 hours of flying time in the aircraft, but officials have said he was landing a Triple 7 at San Francisco International for the first time. He was working with a “training captain” who had logged 3,000 hours on the 777 — but who Hersman said was making his first trip as an instructor. \\"This was the first time he and the flying pilot had flown together,” Hersman said. She also said that the pilots told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed during final approach, which prompts questions about whether a mistake was made in programming the \\"autothrottle\\" or if the equipment malfunctioned. The NTSB has not identified human error, mechanical failure or another problem as the cause of the accident, but the three pilots in the cockpit told the NTSB they realized they were coming in too low when they were at 500 feet. They said they tried to correct it as they lost altitude but could not stop the jetliner's landing gear from clipping the seawall on the way to the runway. “After the impact, the aircraft ballooned, it yawed left and went into a 360-degree spin,” Hersman said. Drug and alcohol tests were not given to the pilots after the crash, but only U.S. pilots are required to take them after incidents at American airports, Hersman said. In a press conference Deborah Hersman of the NTSB details the events from inside the cockpit according to the flight crew during the crash landing of Asiana flight 214. Details of what happened next illustrated the power and horror of the crash: Two flight attendants were ejected from tail-less plane at impact and were found off to the side of the runway. They survived but suffered injuries, Hersman said. At least one evacuation slide deployed inside the cabin, trapping another flight attendant, she confirmed. An oil tank ruptured and leaked fuel onto the hot No. 2 engine, sparking the fire that left the jet a charred hulk. Hersman said she walked from the seawall to the plane on Tuesday, following a trail of wreckage that revealed the landing gear struck the seawall before the tail smacked down and was ripped off. Sections of cabin, aircraft parts, galley materials, newspapers, magazines and flooring were found in the debris field. Two Chinese teenagers on their way to summer camp in the United States were killed — one perhaps run over by a fire engine racing to the scene — and 180 people were injured, with 25 remaining in area hospitals Tuesday, six in critical condition. Remarkably, scores of people walked away unhurt. The plane came in far too slow — 119 mph just before it crash-landed, about 40 mph slower than touchdown speed. Four seconds before impact, the cockpit was warned of a possible stall by a mechanism that rattles the controls in the pilot’s hand. The airline’s chief executive, Yoon Young-doo, said earlier Tuesday that the pilots had adequate qualifications, but he said the airline would nonetheless “beef up” its simulation training. Yoon planned to fly to San Francisco on Tuesday on the same Flight 214.

Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, revealed these and other details during a news conference that included information about the pilots and their flying experience, based on the interviews they've conducted with investigators. Having finished classroom and simulator training, the \\"flying pilot\\" -- as Hersman referred to him -- was in the piloting portion of his training to fly a Boeing 777 at the time of Saturday's crash. He had flown 10 legs and had about 35 hours of flying time with the 777, which put him about halfway through the training required by Asiana of 20 legs and 60 flight hours, when the plane went down, Hersman said. Sitting beside him during Saturday's flight from Seoul to San Francisco was the instructor pilot. The trip across the Pacific was the first time he had been an instructor pilot and the first time he'd traveled with the flying pilot, according to Hersman.

MUST WATCH Young plane crash survivors speak 02:26 That seemingly uneventful, more than 10-hour flight ended in a few chaotic, panicked minutes of fury, after which two people were dead and 182 others were transported to local hospitals. \\"Sections of the cabin ... are found very early in the debris field,\\" said Hersman, who had walked a few hundred feet from the seawall where the plane's landing gear and then tail first slammed into the seawall to where it mercifully came to a rest. \\"You can see aircraft parts, gallery materials, newspapers, magazines and flooring.\\" According to the pilots' accounts, the tensions started before the plane touched ground. The three pilots in the cockpit -- another was in the cabin -- told investigators they set the \\"auto throttle\\" speed to 137 knots (157 mph), which is the speed it should have been going. Akin to cruise control, auto throttles are used to maintain a plane's speed. At 200 feet above ground, the instructor pilot said he noted precision approach path indicator lights indicated the giant jet was too low. It was then \\"he recognized that the auto throttles were not maintaining speed, and he established a go-around attitude,\\" said the NTSB chief. \\"He went to push the throttles forward, but he stated that the other pilot had already (done so).\\" Hersman cautioned anyone from jumping to conclusions as to whether a mechanical or pilot error is to blame for the crash. She also spoke specifically about the auto throttles, saying investigators were delving into how they were working and how they were used. But Hersman also stated: \\"The crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft ... One of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on an approach to landing is speed. So we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit, and also what was going on in the aircraft.\\" 2 dead, 182 injured -- including 2 ejected flight attendants When it departed South Korea, Flight 214 had 307 passengers and crew aboard. Despite the scale of the wreckage -- a hole burned through much of the cabin's roof and the aircraft's back half lopped off -- 123 walked away. Others weren't so lucky, most of all the two Chinese teenagers who died in the crash. Those working on the flight were among the injured. The third pilot in the cockpit cracked a rib.

Many of those hospitalized have been released. At San Francisco General Hospital, for instance, 50 of the 62 patients are now free to go home. But others still require care. Four adults and one child in critical condition are still at San Francisco General suffering from internal bleeding, fractures and spinal cord, abdominal and traumatic brain injuries, according to the hospital. Crew recall plane being too high, then too low The \\"flying pilot\\" and \\"instructor pilot\\" who were in the front seat of the cockpit were not among the injured, according to Hersman. Asiana hired the flying pilot in 1994, after which he reported amassing nearly 10,000 hours of total flight time. That experience included time piloting 737, 747 and A-320 aircraft, and he was a ground school and simulator instructor for the latter model. The instructor pilot, a South Korean air force veteran with about 13,000 hours of flight experience, recalled Flight 214 being \\"slightly high when they passed 4,000 feet (and) they set vertical speed mode at about 1,500 feet per minute,\\" explained Hersman. But they ended up coming in low. The third pilot in the cockpit told investigators that, with \\"the nose ... pitched up, ... he could not see the runway,\\" said the NTSB chief. In the last few hundred feet before touchdown, the crew was making both lateral and vertical adjustments -- meaning they were both trying to move sideways to get toward the runway and adjust their height. When the aircraft hit, it spun 360 degrees. An oil tank ruptured and leaked fuel onto the plane's right engine, starting a fire. Eventually, evacuation chutes deployed, and at least seven of the aircraft's eight doors were opened. (An eighth was found on the ground, Hersman explained.) Very soon after the plane stopped, tending to the wounded and the investigation began. That probe will continue for months, though authorities have released significant details so far. So much information, in fact, the Air Line Pilots Association, for a second straight day on Tuesday, criticized what it called the \\"NTSB's release of incomplete, out-of-context information\\" that \\"has fueled rampant speculation about the cause of the accident.\\" The union further questioned whether some tools were available to the crew, claiming, for instance, that the \\"Instrument Landing System, a critical aid to pilots, (was) out of service.\\" \\"Without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event, partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and, in turn, skew the perception of individuals' behavior,\\" the pilots union said in its Tuesday statement. \\"This could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew's intentions and actions.\\" Hersman disputed the union's claims earlier Tuesday on CNN, saying the agency believes that transparent release of information is crucial. \\"We believe that it is always better to put out the correct information and factual information so that bad information is not able to propagate,\\" she said. Aviation experts say that air crashes often involve several factors, and the San Francisco tragedy appears to be following form. Experience, training, crew actions, airport navigation, and now the possible role of a mechanical system are all in the mix. The NTSB is not expected to render a decision on probable cause for months. During her news conference later Tuesday, Hersman stressed that \\"there's still a lot of work to be done.\\" \\"We will not determine probable cause while we are here on scene,\\" she said, adding there's a lot of information to collect and analyze. \\"...I would really encourage all of you to be very cautious about speculating on the cause of the crash.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed upon landing at San Francisco airport on July 6, 2013, resulting in two deaths and 182 injuries.

It came from a Post reader named Ron Freiman who’d seen my Sunday column advancing the Giants-49ers game. In it I referred to this tenuous time for Giants fans as approaching the low-point days of the 1978 revolt by season ticket holders which included ticket burning and an airplane banner flown over Giants Stadium reading: “15 Years of Lousy Football — We’ve Had Enough.’’ Freiman recalled the catalyst to his becoming the leader of that ’78 fan revolt as “sitting at that Philadelphia game when they had the fumble and I couldn’t get up from my seat I was so stunned. It was a victory that they just threw away.’’ The day after The Fumble Freiman purchased a display ad in the Newark Star-Ledger for 120 that included a post office box urging angry fans to send their tickets in. “We’ll burn them and they’ll play in front of an empty stadium ’’ Freiman said. “Hundreds of people sent their tickets to be burned ’’ Freiman said. “I was totally baffled by the reaction. There were a lot of disappointed fans … as I’m sure there are now.’’ The famous airplane banner came the following Sunday. Freiman said he and another season-ticket holder named Peter Valentine an attorney arranged the plane flyover. “[Valentine] knew somebody who had this [plane-rental] service and we decided ‘Let’s fly this thing around and see what happens ’ ’’ Freiman recalled. “It caused quite a stir … and it did some good because they got rid of a lot of people and they still talk about it.’’ Freiman said he later met Young at a luncheon at the old Giants hangout Manny’s in Moonachie N.J. “He knew I was the guy who did it so I wasn’t looked upon too well by Giants management ’’ Freiman said with a laugh. “I sent the ashes from the ticket burning to Wellington Mara in a urinal one of those hospital bedpans and I don’t think they took very kindly to that. It’s probably still sitting up in their offices.

The service member got off several rounds but was unable to stop the gunman, who fired at the building, then charged inside and kept shooting, said Ed Reinhold, special agent in charge of the bureau’s Knoxville office. In a chilling timeline, Reinhold described how the gunman, identified as Muhammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, moved through the building and shot people as he encountered them, then ran out the back and kept firing. Four Marines and a Navy petty officer were killed before Chattanooga police shot and killed Abdulazeez. Four of the service members died outside, in a motor pool area behind the building, and one died inside, Reinhold said. It all took less than five minutes. Reinhold said the FBI was treating the gunman as a “homegrown violent extremist,” and he said investigators believe he had no help in executing the attack. But he said it was too early to determine whether Abdulazeez was radicalized. Mohammad Youssuf Adbulazeez Hamilton County Sheriffs Office via AP Investigators have focused on a trip to Jordan last year by Abdulazeez, and an uncle has been detained there, according to his lawyer. NBC News reported on Tuesday that Abdulazeez downloaded audio recordings of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and al Qaeda recruiter killed by an American drone strike in 2011. A family representative has told NBC News that Abdulazeez had been in a three-day downward spiral before the attack, suffered from depression and had thoughts of suicide. The Navy and Marines center was the second target of Abdulazeez’s rampage. Minutes earlier, he had unloaded dozens of rounds into the doors of a military recruiting station about seven miles away. In the chaos at the Navy and Marines center, two service members “attempted to provide cover” and help people escape, Reinhold said. And a Marine commander, Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier, said that Marines went room to room to shepherd their fellow service members to safety, and that some “willingly ran back into the fight.” \\"When history records what happened in Chattanooga last week,\\" he said, \\"it won’t be remembered for the heinous actions of one individual. The legacy of that day is one of valor — a day of American strength.” Reinhold said that the service member fired on Abdulazeez after he crashed the gates of the Navy and Marines center and got out of his car carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and ammunition. Investigators will have to wait for autopsy results to determine whether the service member hit Abdulazeez, Reinhold said.

At least one of those two weapons was fired at the gunman. The military plans to increase security at recruiting stations and reserve centers because of the attack, but those plans do not include arming personnel at off-base facilities like the ones attacked in Chattanooga. Besides the two weapons belonging to service members, investigators at the scene found two guns belonging to Abdulazeez and one in his car, Reinhold said. All five service members were killed with bullets from the same gun, he said. ||||| CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — Twenty Marines and two Navy corpsman were in the middle of an otherwise mundane task, just checking their equipment after a training mission, when the silver Mustang convertible came barreling through the gates of the reserve center on the banks of the Tennessee River.

Investigators said they... (Associated Press) Rear Adm. Mary M. Jackson, the commander of the Navy Southeast Region, speaks at a news conference in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Wednesday, July 22, 2015, about the shootings that left four Marines one sailor... (Associated Press) The driver blasted his way through that facility for the next three to five minutes, officials said during a Wednesday news conference that provided the most complete account yet of how four Marines and a sailor were killed. The shooter's motives remain unclear to investigators, even nearly a week later. Muhammad Abdulazeez made his first stop at a military recruiting office about 7 miles away, sending recruiters there scrambling for cover from the hail of gunfire that left the front windows pocked with bullet holes. Abdulazeez never left the driver's seat, staying only briefly before moving to his next target. After plowing his rented car through the gates, and with Chattanooga Police chasing close behind, the gunman got out of the car and stormed into the building. He was ready for a shootout: Abdulazeez wore a vest with extra ammunition. One gun was found in his vehicle; an assault rifle and a handgun were found on him. A service member inside the building saw Abdulazeez approaching and fired at him. The gunman shot back and then proceeded inside. Once inside, he fatally wounded Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith and \\"continued to shoot those he encountered,\\" FBI Knoxville Special Agent in Charge Ed Reinhold said at a news conference. As police followed the gunshots, he then walked out the back door into a gated motor pool area, where troops tried to scramble over a fence to safety. It was there that the remaining four were killed: Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson Holmquist, Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan and Lance Cpl. Squire Wells. When the shooting first started, troops inside the building went room to room to rush their colleagues to safety, said Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier, commanding general of the 4th Marine Division. Then, some rushed back into the fight. Two guns belonging to service members were recovered at the scene, he said; shots were fired from at least one. It's unclear if the gunman was hit by one of those weapons, Reinhold said. The military will investigate whether the service members were authorized to have those weapons. In the motor pool area, two Marines tried to \\"provide cover\\" while their comrades tried to escape over the fence, Reinhold said. Both Reinhold and Brier declined to elaborate further on how the troops engaged Abdulazeez. \\"I can tell you that our Marines reacted the way you would expect,\\" Brier said. At one point, Abdulazeez tried to run back into the building. When he did, Chattanooga officers confronted him. A shootout erupted. One police officer was wounded; Abdulazeez was killed. When asked about the possibility of friendly fire, Reinhold said it appears that all of the victims were killed by the same weapon. Friends and neighbors recalled a happy, polite young man. But a picture has emerged showing Abdulazeez was troubled in his last days: He abused drugs and alcohol, stared down the possibility of bankruptcy and couldn't find a job. He failed a drug test in 2013, getting him fired from a job at a power plant, which prompted personal writings soon after lamenting what a failure he had been, according to his family. An uncle in Jordan who agreed to host him in an effort to sober up Abdulazeez now is detained in that country, according to that man's attorney and a government official. The Jordanian government official, who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators are trying to learn as much as they can about Abdulazeez's stay there. Reinhold said only that the FBI would investigate every possibility and every relative, no matter where they are located. \\"The uncle is a regular person, he has a company, he is a businessman, he has no relation with any militant group or organization,\\" said Abed al-Kader Ahmad al-Khateeb, the attorney representing Asaad Ibrahim Asaad Haj Ali. \\"He cares about his work and his family, and Muhammad is just his relative, the son of his sister. That's it.\\" It is too early to determine whether Abdulazeez was \\"radicalized\\" before the attacks, Reinhold said. But when asked if Abdulazeez acted alone, Reinhold said he was currently being treated as a \\"homegrown violent extremist.\\" \\"We believe he acted on his own that day. ... We do not have any indication that anyone else was assisting him on that day.\\" ___ Loller reported from Nashville. Associated Press writer Karin Laub contributed to this report from Amman, Jordan. |||||","completion":"A bad guy named Muhammad Youssuf Abdulazeez attacked a place called a Navy and Marines center last week.

Four Marines and a Navy man were killed before police were able to stop Abdulazeez. The FBI is trying to find out if anyone else helped him with this attack.

Q:Article: Playing with toy blocks may lead to improved language development in young children, a new study reported. Early childhood is an important period in the development of young minds. The newborn brain grows three times in size between birth and age 2. Scientists have said that certain activities during this important period may promote healthy development while others may hold it back, and development of memory and language may especially be helped by imaginative play. After six months, language scores among half of the 175 children aged 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 who were sent plastic blocks were 15 percent higher than a matched group that did not receive the free blocks, according to the study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle. Parents were given ideas about how to help their children play with the blocks, then were told to keep diaries of their children's activities over four days. Finally, all the parents filled out questionnaires that judged their children's vocabulary, grammar, and other language abilities. Study author Dimitri Christakis said unstructured play with blocks motivated children's thinking, memory and physical skills at a time when a child's brain is growing rapidly. \\"They are the foundation of thought and language,\\" he wrote of the skills learned from building blocks. \\"Older children begin to make up stories for these objects .\\" Such play may also take the place of less helpful activities such as watching TV, he said, adding parents ought to have doubts about some toy-makers' words. \\"An increasing number of media-based products are making ungrounded claims that they can make children smarter, more literate, and more musical,\\" Christakis said.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Original master discs are created by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a modulated groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a \\"metallic soap,\\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \\"wax\\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \\"plating\\" of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \\"matrix\\" or \\"father.\\" The \\"father\\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \\"mother\\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \\"father\\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \\"mothers\\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \\"sons\\". Each \\"mother\\" can be used to make many \\"sons\\" before deteriorating. The \\"sons\\" are then converted into \\"stampers\\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \\"father\\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \\"son\\" (for each side), the \\"father\\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \\"two-step-process\\" (as it does not entail creation of \\"sons\\" but does involve creation of \\"mothers,\\" which are used for test playing and kept as \\"safeties\\" for electroforming future \\"sons\\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The \\"sons\\" made during a \\"three-step\\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than \\"fathers\\". Now answer this question: What is the limitation of the two step process?","completion":"The limitation of the two-step process is that it can only produce a few hundred vinyl pressings. This is because it doesn't use the \\"sons\\" in the electroforming process and goes directly from the \\"father\\" to create the stampers, after creating the \\"mothers\\" which are used for test playing and as safeties."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a witch hunt, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights. According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical Necronomicon Ex-Mortis. Ash then starts his search for the Necronomicon. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror, Small reflections of him pursue, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries. When he arrives at the Necronomicon's location, he finds three books instead of one and finds the actual.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what does a cutter do Suggested answer: When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch, it often results in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot . Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"The answer provided is partially correct, as it focuses solely on the context of baseball, specifically addressing a cutter pitch. A cutter, in the context of baseball, is a type of pitch that is thrown with a slight side spin that causes the ball to move horizontally across the plate, often away from a right-handed batter if thrown by a right-handed pitcher (and vice versa). By doing so, it effectively keeps the ball away from the bat's sweet spot, making it difficult for the batter to make solid contact with the ball, often resulting in soft contact and an easy out for the fielding team. However, the term \\"cutter\\" can have multiple meanings outside of the baseball context. In general, a cutter refers to someone or something that cuts. Depending on the field or industry, this could mean: 1. A cutting tool or instrument: A cutter can be any tool or device designed to cut or slice through materials such as paper, cardboard, fabric, or metal. Examples include scissors, knives, and box cutters. 2. A person who cuts materials: In certain professions, such as tailoring or woodworking, the term cutter may refer to a skilled worker who specializes in cutting materials according to specific patterns or designs. 3. A ship: A cutter is a type of sailing vessel, often used by naval forces, coast guard, or maritime rescue organizations. Cutters typically have a single mast and are designed for quick maneuverability and deployment. 4. A film or video editor: In the film and television industry, a cutter refers to a person who edits raw footage, assembling it into coherent scenes, sequences, and ultimately, a completed film or program. In conclusion, while the suggested answer is accurate within the specific context of baseball, it does not address the various other meanings and uses of the term \\"cutter\\" in different fields and industries.

Additionally, a significant number of people speak English as a native language in countries like Ireland, South Africa, and several Caribbean nations. Here is a more detailed overview of these countries: 1. United Kingdom: English is the official language and the native language of the majority of the population in the United Kingdom, comprising England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. British English, with its distinct accent and vocabulary, is the most widely spoken variant of English in the UK. 2. United States: The United States is the single largest English-speaking country, with the majority of its more than 300 million people considering English as their native language. Several dialects are spoken across the country, including General American, Southern American English, and African American Vernacular English (AAVE). 3. Canada: English is one of the two official languages of Canada, along with French. Approximately 60% of Canadians claim English as their native language, with Canadian English bearing similarities to both British and American English. 4. Australia: English is the official language of Australia, spoken by the vast majority of its population. Australian English, a distinct dialect, is characterized by its unique vocabulary, pronunciation, and slang terms. 5. New Zealand: New Zealand English, a dialect resembling Australian English, is the most widely spoken language in the country. As one of New Zealand's official languages, it is used in government, education, media, and daily communication. 6.

Given the question: What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony? Answer the above question based on the context below: Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression.

Many people are afraid to eat it, because they think the bacteria in it might make them sick. However, a new study shows that sea bacteria are good for people. The study finds that a special enzyme from sea bacteria is helpful to humans. It helps people to get more energy from food. To people's surprise, the enzyme is present only in the Japanese. The Japanese traditionally like to eat food rich in seaweed . And the seaweed is rich in this kind of enzyme. However, the enzyme isn't present in all the Japanese. During the study, just 5 out of 14 Japanese had the enzyme.

Plot title: The League of Gentlemen Movie plot: A manhole opens at night in an empty street and out climbs Lieutenant-Colonel Norman Hyde (Jack Hawkins) in a dinner suit. He gets into a Rolls-Royce and drives home. There, he prepares seven envelopes, each containing an American crime paperback called The Golden Fleece, half of a Â£5-note and an unsigned invitation from âCo-operative Removals Limitedâ to lunch at the Cafe Royal. The envelopes are sent to former army officers, each in desperate or humiliating circumstances. When they all turn up looking for the other half of the Â£5 notes which are handed out, Hyde asks their opinion of the novel which is about a robbery. They show little enthusiasm but Hyde then reveals each person's misdemeanors. Hyde has no criminal record but holds a grudge for being made redundant by the army after a long career. He intends to rob a bank using the team's skills, with equal shares of Â£100,000 or more for each man. The gang meet under the guise of an amateur dramatic society rehearsing Journeyâs End to discuss the plan before moving into Hydeâs house and living a military regimen of duties and fines for being out of line. Hyde knows that a million pounds in used notes is regularly delivered to a City of London bank and has details of the delivery. They raid an army training camp in Dorset for arms and supplies. Hyde, Mycroft, Porthill and Race distract soldiers by posing as senior officers on an unscheduled food inspection. The others steal weapons while posing as telephone repairmen, speaking in Irish accents to divert suspicion to the IRA. The gang rent a warehouse to prepare. Race steals vehicles including cars and a truck which are fitted with false number plates. They are disturbed by a passing policeman who ironically offers to keep an eye on their premises as he patrols. In Hydeâs basement, the gang train with maps and models.

It is important to analyze the information that is presented in the sentence: \\"A red-haired person in a green shirt holds an ice cream cone up to the mouth of a man in a red shirt and yellow baseball cap, at the counter of an ice cream store.\\" From this sentence, we can deduce the following key points: 1. There are two people: a red-haired person in a green shirt and a man in a red shirt and yellow baseball cap. 2. They are at the counter of an ice cream store. 3. The red-haired person is holding an ice cream cone up to the mouth of the man. Based on this information, we can visualize the situation. It is evident that the two individuals are interacting and are involved in the ice cream sharing process. However, we cannot conclude that they went to the store together or that they have any relationship beyond this interaction. Since there are no explicit or implicit indications within the sentence that suggest they visited the ice cream store as a pair, we cannot confirm the veracity of \\"The two people went to get ice cream together.\\" For all we know, they could be complete strangers, or perhaps the red-haired person is an employee of the ice cream store assisting a customer. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not possible to tell whether the two people went to get ice cream together or not, without more information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you’d like to be seen by as many passers-by as possible (and consequently receive as many tips as possible), you’ll need to select a location with a high level of pedestrian traffic. Street performers commonly set up along walking malls, large sidewalks and street corners, or in large public parks or gardens. Make sure to avoid areas where “No Busking” signs are prominently posted. You’ll also need to confirm that you can legally perform and solicit money in the area that you select. Generally, busking is legal on public property. Most large cities will have publically available busking guidelines posted online. Consult these, or speak with other buskers to determine where you can and cannot perform. Living statues often work as buskers and rely on their performance as a part of their income. Passing pedestrians who appreciate your costume and talent will often linger and join other individuals to watch you in full statue costume. If you have a hat, bucket, or jar set out, appreciative audience members will drop in money. If you’re only planning to perform as a living statue as a hobby and don’t want to make an income from the work, you don’t need to put out a collections bucket. Resist the urge to jump out at toddlers and young children to startle them. The idea of a large grey statue coming to life and frightening a child could potentially give them nightmares. If you treat your audience members—especially children—with hostility, your audience will soon stop giving you money. Some people dislike being near living statues and find them creepy due to their realism. If anybody complains, simply inform them that you are doing this as performance art, not to try to disturb people. Unfortunately, some individuals find it funny to harass, heckle, or otherwise bother and assault living statues. There are various ways that living can statues can discourage hecklers and protect themselves from hasslers. You can try various techniques, and find one that works for you and your costume. For example, when dealing with unruly teenagers or adults, jumping out and scaring them away can be a defense that allows you to stay in character. This applies to any people who try to touch you or generally treat you poorly. If you have tried to discourage hecklers while staying in character, you may need to break character and speak to persistent hecklers. Although performers try to stay in character for a long as possible, it’s worth breaking character to protect your personal space and keep from potentially being assaulted. If someone continues to try to touch your or hassle you, try saying something like, “This isn’t funny and you’re making me uncomfortable, please stop hassling me.”","completion":"To succeed as a living statue performer, choose a location with high pedestrian traffic, ensure busking is legal, maintain a respectful demeanor towards your audience, and employ various techniques to protect yourself from hecklers while staying in character."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a teenager, and a top member of his high school's wrestling team, he proves himself physically fit and athletic, as well as an academically exceptional student. When local Marine recruiting NCOs visit his school and give Ron and his fellow seniors an impassioned lecture about the Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom, because he is unable to get a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.The story then jumps to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in 1968. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, Wilson, who ends up in the line of fire between sides. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO.The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol on January 20. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded, shot in the ankle and through the chest, smashing his spine. He lays trapped in a field facing sure death, until a fellow Marine rescues him.

(AP) One of the most significant moments of the presidency of John F. Kennedy, who died 50 years ago today, began when the United States discovered Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The Cuban missile crisis ended peacefully -- the Soviet Union withdrew the warheads in exchange for Kennedy pulling its own missiles from Turkey -- but came awfully close to sparking World War III, a threat that forever changed Americans' perceptions of the Cold War. Historians have long debated how the crisis started, escalated and ended. One aspect of that debate getting a lot of attention on today's anniversary is Kennedy's role. Was it his fault that the world almost ended in nuclear annihilation in the fall of 1962? Here are the cases for, against, half-for-half-against and my own take. The case that it was Kennedy's fault The argument, explained nicely by colleague Dylan Matthews here, is that Kennedy provoked the Soviet Union into putting the missiles in Cuba and then overreacted when he found them. He had sponsored a failed militia invasion of Cuba with the Bay of Pigs debacle, leading Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to fear a fuller U.S. invasion. Kennedy had also put medium-range nuclear weapons in Turkey -- so-called \\"first-strike weapons\\" because they were close enough to Moscow to be used to start a war. Khrushchev, in this view, placed the missiles in Cuba only in response to Kennedy's provocations. The Soviet leader felt compelled to re-balance the playing field with his own potential first-strike weapons; he also wanted to prevent an American invasion of Cuba. Kennedy, Matthews argues, should have understood this and seen the warheads as a reasonable and defensive reaction rather than a provocative step toward war. But Kennedy took it as an implicit act of aggression and responded with the threat of severe escalation, which is how the world almost ended. The case that it wasn't Kennedy's fault Everyone pretty much concedes that the Bay of Pigs was a catastrophe. But it also virtually guaranteed that the United States, badly embarrassed by the incident, would not attempt a similar stunt again, much less the full military invasion that Khrushchev feared. His miscalculation led him to install the nuclear weapons on Cuba -- so did his mistaken belief that Americans would shrug off the warheads as a tit-for-tat response to the U.S. missiles in Turkey. Americans, Kennedy included, actually found it pretty terrifying. The fact that Khrushchev had installed them in total secret deepened fears that these weapons were meant not to protect Havana, but to launch a surprise first-strike against Washington. In this view, the mere chance that the Soviet Union would or could use the Cuba-based missiles to initiate a nuclear war against the United States made them unacceptable. Kennedy responded by publicly raising the pressure with an embargo against Cuba but also quietly offering Moscow concessions should it back down; historian Graham Allison argues that this increased the immediate risk of war but also created the opportunity for the ultimate, peaceful resolution. The case that it was and wasn't Kennedy's fault Both Kennedy and Khrushchev profoundly misunderstood one another's goals and intentions, leading the United States and the Soviet Union to misread the situation and almost walk into a war neither of them wanted. As I wrote last year on the crisis's 50th anniversary, each leader failed to understand the degree to which his counterpart simply saw a different world. At the time, Kennedy and Washington in general were obsessed with the perceived \\"missile gap\\" with the Soviet Union, an arms race they saw as all-important. They worried that, should any one side get too far ahead of the other, that \\"winning\\" side would be tempted to use its advantage to start and \\"win\\" a nuclear war before the other could catch up. So, when Khrushchev put missiles in Cuba, they assumed he was attempting to leap ahead of the United States in the placement of strategic nuclear weapons -- a possible prelude to war. Kennedy was wrong, but Khrushchev was making a similar mistake. He saw the Cold War as driven not primarily by the arms race, an American obsession, but by a grand ideological struggle. Western capitalist imperialism, he believed, sought ever-outward expansion. Kennedy would try again for Cuba before pushing on to the rest of Latin America. American aggression could be deterred only with defensive nuclear weapons. Without U.S. meddling, Khrushchev believed, Soviet-style communism would flow naturally from Cuba to the rest of the region. They were both very wrong, not just about the forces driving the world but about one another's motivations. Each assumed that the other must naturally share his assumptions and his understanding of the world. Which brings me to... The case that it was the Cold War's fault The Cold War had many, many causes, but this mutual misunderstanding was certainly one of them, and not just during the Cuban missile crisis or even Kennedy's tenure. American and Soviet leaders had been misreading one another's intentions, overstating one another's strengths and playing down one another's weaknesses for years before Kennedy took office and would continue to do so for decades after. Those mistakes consistently led both countries to escalate both defensively and offensively and to shape their foreign policies around one another. Ironically, it was Ronald Reagan, the American president we most remember as an anti-Soviet hard-liner, who along with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would finally break down those mental barriers and attempt to erase the nuclear threat once and for all. Right up until the collapse of the Berlin Wall, much of the White House -- including future CIA director and defense secretary Robert M. Gates -- opposed those talks, warning that Gorbachev was a wolf in sheep's clothing. They were wrong, just as Kennedy had been wrong about Khrushchev's intentions during the Cuban missile crisis and just as Khrushchev had been wrong about Kennedy's intentions toward Cuba. But that was the Cold War -- completely insane.

About 10 years ago, Serge and Agnes (Serge's ex) spent a weekend with two other couples. Serge insisted that it was clear that Agnes arranged to hog the heat, and Agnes still adamantly maintains that she didn't. This suggests Agnes might be a liar.

He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.

Daniel Martin. PUBLISHED:. 17:26 EST, 15 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 02:35 EST, 16 April 2012. MPs are fighting to keep 12 fig trees in their offices, even though it costs the taxpayer £32,500 a year. They say removing the trees from an entrance hall in a parliamentary office block would make the place too hot and noisy. More than £400,000 has been spent on the rental and upkeep of the trees since they were installed 11 years ago. Not giving a fig: Politicians say this entrance at Portcullis House in Westminister would become overheated if the trees were removed. Despite this, MPs are suggesting they be kept – claiming that uprooting the trees would make the glass-roofed atrium of Portcullis House, in Westminster, uncomfortably hot in the summer and would decrease the quality of air that MPs breathe. They also claim that removing the trees would result in ‘higher ambient noise levels’, making it harder for parliamentarians to do their job. In February, John Bercow said he was 'horrified' to discover that parliamentary authorities had signed the contract and called for it to be scrapped. The option of keeping the trees will be discussed at a meeting of Commons officials next week. In February, Speaker John Bercow said he was ‘horrified’ to discover that parliamentary authorities had signed the contract, which began in 2001, and called for it to be scrapped to save taxpayers’ money. But it has now emerged that the House of Commons Commission, which runs the parliamentary estate, is suggesting that getting rid of the trees could be more trouble than it is worth. Instead, they will try to reduce the cost to taxpayers by renegotiating with the rental firm Plant Care. The information was revealed by Anne. Main, Tory MP for St Albans, after she tabled a parliamentary question. to the House of Commons Commission. She. asked whether the body had ‘given consideration to the use of the space. previously occupied by the fig trees in Portcullis House in the event. that the trees are removed’. John. Thurso, a Lib Dem MP who sits on the board of the Commission, replied:. ‘No. The Commission agreed on February 27 that the contract for the hire. and upkeep of trees should be renegotiated at the earliest opportunity. with the aim of reducing the cost significantly. ‘Removal of the trees would lead to a. noticeable increase in noise levels and reduced levels of shade. (especially in summer, where the glass roof would probably lead to a. requirement for additional cooling). The trees also improve air. quality.’ The option of keeping the trees inside Portcullis House, pictured, will be discussed at a meeting of Commons officials next week. Mr Thurso added: ‘The removal of the trees would result in higher ambient noise levels.’ A spokesman for the House of Commons Commission said no decision would be taken on what to do with the trees until next week. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Despite all the warm words from Westminster, it appears MPs are all talk when it comes to rooting out wasteful spending. ‘Taxpayers are getting a terrible deal from renting this opulent greenery. Parliament should do the right thing and find a more affordable solution. ‘Politicians shouldn’t shy away from ditching wasteful contracts.’ Not giving a fig: Politicians say this entrance would become overheated.

Some MPs argue that removing the trees would lead to increased temperature and noise levels, negatively impacting officials' working conditions.

The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time. - The Cenomanian is, in the ICS' geological timescale the oldest or earliest age of the Late Cretaceous epoch or the lowest stage of the Upper Cretaceous series. An age is a unit of geochronology: it is a unit of time; the stage is a unit in the stratigraphic column deposited during the corresponding age. Both age and stage bear the same name. - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink.

The German region Hesse uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss.

Given the question: Question: If a person isn't thick they are what? Options: - sparse - slender - unacquainted - skinny - free flowing Explain why a human would choose \\"slender\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"slender\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Interpretation and elimination of options: The first step in answering this question is to understand the meaning of the word \\"thick\\" in this context and to eliminate options that don't fit. The word \\"thick\\" here can be interpreted as referring to a person's body size, which means they have a larger or more substantial build. With this understanding, we can eliminate options that don't relate to a person's size or build, such as \\"sparse,\\" \\"unacquainted,\\" and \\"free-flowing.\\" 2. Synonyms and antonyms: The next step is to identify synonyms and antonyms of \\"thick\\" to get a better understanding of the appropriate answer. \\"Thick\\" in this context means having a wide or substantial build, so an antonym or opposite of that would be having a slim or narrow build. Out of the remaining options, \\"skinny\\" and \\"slender\\" both relate to a person's size, but \\"slender\\" is a better antonym for \\"thick.\\" 3. Connotation and nuance: Although \\"skinny\\" and \\"slender\\" both refer to a slim or narrow build, they have different connotations. \\"Skinny\\" implies that a person is excessively or unhealthily thin, whereas \\"slender\\" suggests a more attractive or healthy slimness. Since the question doesn't specify any negative connotation, a human would prefer the more neutral option, which is \\"slender.\\" 4. Context and common usage: Finally, a human might choose \\"slender\\" based on familiar language patterns and common usage in daily conversations regarding body size and shape descriptions. Considering these factors, a human would choose \\"slender\\" as the answer because it is the most appropriate and accurate opposite of \\"thick\\" in the context of the question."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

When I told Kathy she insisted that i need TWO sheep because ... well , just because . And I obeyed . What type of design does the narrator like ?","completion":"The narrator likes folk-art design, which generally refers to a unique and expressive art style that often incorporates traditional cultural elements, symbolism, and craftsmanship. This type of design is typically created by untrained artists, self-taught individuals, or communities with a shared artistic heritage. In the context of the text, the narrator is specifically drawn to folk-art designs that incorporate repurposed materials, such as the sheep sculpture made from an oil can and flattened auto parts. Folk-art design embraces a broad range of art forms and media, encompassing decorative objects, functional items, and even architectural elements. It is valued for its artistic individuality, cultural significance, and the ingenuity with which it utilizes available resources. In this case, the artist's use of recycled materials like an oil can and car parts gives the sculpture a unique, creative, and environmentally conscious appeal. The narrator's appreciation for folk-art design stems from its distinctive and authentic character, which often embodies the spirit and traditions of the artist's community or cultural background. Additionally, folk-art designs offer an alternative to mass-produced and commercial art, providing a more personal, handcrafted touch to the pieces. The fact that the narrator's friend Kathy insisted on having two sheep further highlights the appeal of folk-art designs, as it often presents an opportunity to create unique pairings or groupings of items that reflect the owner’s personal taste and style.

Most people who sell scrap copper don't rely on finding it by chance. They have sources on which they rely to find a steady supply of copper to sell. For example, you might be able to set up an agreement with an appliance repair store to pick up damaged goods you know contain copper. They might be happy to allow you to recycle what would otherwise wind up in a landfill. Cut wires off the outside. Wire can be snipped off of TV’s and monitors with scissors. Cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile. The small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile. Search inside for insulated wires and connectors. Thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops, VCR’s and DVD players. Take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive. Large appliances are often sold for steel. But don’t forget to look inside for copper wiring. Small appliances such as coffee makers, AC units, fans, blenders and toasters may all have copper wiring inside. Small electronics, such as cell phones, cameras and hand-held games are good places to search for copper wire. Electricians scrape up electrical wire for scrap during demolition. Plumbing materials also contain copper and brass. Always check with the owner or a construction supervisor before taking copper away from a property that you do not own. Even if you are being paid to clean a demolition site, that does not give you a claim to the wire or any other materials you find there. Look for old statues or décor. Old garden gnomes, statues and other lawn ornaments may contain copper. In addition, sometimes roofing material is made from copper sheeting. Roofing copper is recyclable and environmentally friendly. Unless you have permission to remove copper from a property you do not own, it is considered theft. Copper theft has been on the rise since the value of copper started to increase in 2004. CNBC refers to copper theft as an epidemic that is sweeping the United States. The FBI states that copper theft is threatening the infrastructure of the United States. Thieves are targeting electrical sub-stations, cellular towers, telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction sites, and vacant homes. Delivery of electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and security and emergency services is disrupted. This poses a threat to public safety and national security. Businesses are taking steps to protect themselves from copper theft. They are installing security cameras, securing metals in locked areas, installing alarms, limiting access to buildings and increasing lighting. In many states, the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony has to do with the value of items stolen. Since copper is so valuable, copper thieves are often charged with a felony when caught. Also, since copper thieves can knock out traffic lights or disrupt 911 services, other felony charges such as disrupting public service may be filed. Summary:","completion":"To find a steady supply of scrap copper, consider setting up an agreement with appliance repair stores to pick up damaged goods containing copper. You can find copper in wires, TVs, monitors, laptops, VCRs, DVD players, desktop computer towers, large appliances, small appliances, small electronics, and plumbing materials.

He witnesses a murder by a couple of Johnny's thugs, but won't betray Friendly, who is both his brother's (Rod Steiger) boss and a long-time friend of his family.What he sees at the docks repulses Terry. In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them. Those who complain of the working conditions or wages one day don't work the next day, or are placed in harm's way. Consequently, most tolerate being abused.After befriending both the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of the murdered man and the local priest (Karle Malden), Terry gradually becomes a man of deeper morality, and starts to speak of acts against Friendly, who will soon go on trial.

I read this background article the other day: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. I am facing a new situation today: Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January? A:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article, January is colder in the Northern Hemisphere. The article mentions that during May, June and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. This is due to Earth's axial tilt, which causes the sun to be higher in the sky during these months, increasing the solar flux and thus, warming the climate. As a result, these months are the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere, where temperatures are typically warmer. In contrast, the article points out that the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly during November, December, and January. This implies that in these months, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, receiving less direct sunlight. As a result, these are the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, and the temperatures are typically colder. The calendar works the same in both hemispheres. However, the seasons are reversed due to differences in sunlight exposure caused by the Earth's axial tilt. This means that when it's winter in one hemisphere, it's summer in the other, and vice versa. So, if Stan moved from the US (located in the Northern Hemisphere) to Australia (in the Southern Hemisphere), he would experience winter during June, July, and August instead of December, January, and February, as he would have in the US. Conversely, during December, January, and February - typically the coldest months in the US - he would experience summer in Australia. Therefore, if we stick strictly to the question about which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January, the correct answer would be January. July is a summer month in the Northern Hemisphere, thus typically seeing warmer temperatures, whereas January is a winter month and is typically colder."},{"prompt":"\\"Helge Andreas Norbakken\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Question: After Greeks from different areas, as opposed to those from Mother Cities began colonizing, what happened to the Greek language abroad. Context: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of numbers. Each list is presented with brackets and comma-separated values. For example, a list of numbers is [1,2,3] and a list of two lists of numbers is [[1,2],[3,4,6]]. You should sum up the values at every position of every inner list and put it as an element of your answer, that is, you should sum the first members of each inner list together and put it as the first element of the list, then sum the second members of each inner list together and put it as the second element of your list, etc. The output should be a list of numbers with the same length as the longest inner list. Q: [[27, -6, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77], [-86, -64, -67]] A:","completion":"Task explanation: The task asks to sum up the values at each position from every inner list. The total sum will be put as an element of the answer list. If a list is shorter than others, missing values are considered 0. The output list's length should be the same as the longest inner list in the given data. Guidelines: 1. Identify the longest list among all the inner list. 2. Then iterate from the first element to the last element of the longest list. 3. In each iteration, add the value of each inner list's corresponding position. 4. If an inner list is shorter and doesn't have a value at that position, consider it 0. 5. The sum then is added to the output list. 6. Repeat the process until the end of the longest list. Solution: Let's work with the given example: [[27, -6, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77], [-86, -64, -67]]. The longest list is [27, -6, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77] with 7 elements. Start iterating: For the 1st position: sum of (27 & -86), -59 For the 2nd position: sum of (-6 & -64), -70 For the 3rd position: there's no 3rd element in the second list, so it's considered as 0. Hence sum of (97 & 0), 97 The same process 0 summing will be used for the 4th to the 7th positions. For the 4th position: sum of (-49 & 0), -49 For the 5th position: sum of (77 & 0), 77 For the 6th position: sum of (-82 & 0), -82 For the 7th position: sum of (-77 & 0), -77 Using these sums, we get the final summed list: [-59, -70, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77]"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

She thinks the Options: 1). dolls will appreciate in value.; 2). clothes will appreciate in value.;","completion":"Margaret prefers to spend her money on dolls, rather than clothes. She believes that dolls have a higher potential to appreciate in value compared to clothing items. Margaret has a set reasoning behind this belief, as she takes various factors into consideration. Firstly, Margaret understands that dolls, especially collectible or limited edition ones, can become rare and valuable over time as collectors seek to complete their collections. The demand for these specific dolls often increases, and as supply remains limited, their value appreciates. She has come to learn about the thriving community of doll collectors who are willing to pay premium prices to own rare and hard-to-find dolls, which further reinforces her idea of the potential appreciation in the value of dolls. Additionally, Margaret has seen some dolls become pop culture icons, such as Barbie dolls or American Girl dolls. These dolls are often rebranded, re-released, and reimagined over the years. This can lead to the original releases becoming more valuable due to nostalgia and historical significance. As people seek to reminisce about their childhood memories or capture a piece of pop culture history, the value of these dolls can increase substantially. Moreover, Margaret appreciates the artistic value that comes with some dolls. Dolls that are handmade or have intricate crafting can become valuable for the craftsmanship and skill behind their creation. These dolls can become miniature works of art that people are willing to pay a premium for, further adding to their potential appreciation in value. On the other hand, Margaret thinks that clothes are not likely to appreciate in value at the same rate as dolls. While some designer pieces and high-end fashion items can become coveted over time, the majority of clothing items face depreciation due to wear and tear and changes in fashion trends. Also, clothes are produced in larger quantities and are not likely to hold the same exclusivity factor that dolls can possess. Furthermore, clothes are not as easily preserved compared to dolls. Dolls can be stored in display cases for protection and retain their quality, but clothing items often deteriorate over time due to environmental factors, even when stored properly. This adds to the likelihood of depreciation in the value of clothes. In conclusion, Margaret prefers to invest her money in dolls over clothes as she perceives dolls to have a greater potential for appreciation in value. Dolls can become collectible items, pop culture icons, and even showcase artistic value, making them a more lucrative investment opportunity in comparison to clothing items. Margaret's perspective is shaped by her understanding of the market demands, rarity, and longevity of dolls, which she believes surpasses the potential for appreciation in the value of most clothes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why were Greek texts important?\\" Context: \\"Despite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Greek texts were important for several reasons, particularly during the 14th century and the Italian Renaissance, which was a period of significant progress in the arts, sciences, and intellectual development. The primary reasons behind the significance of Greek texts include: 1. Preservation of knowledge: Ancient Greek texts contained a wealth of knowledge in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and literature. The revival of interests in these texts led to the preservation and dissemination of this knowledge, which had been partly lost during the Middle Ages in Western Europe. 2. Influence on philosophical thinking: The works of Greek philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, played a crucial role in shaping the intellectual landscape of Europe during the Renaissance. These texts provided new ideas and perspectives on ethics, metaphysics, politics, and aesthetics, influencing the development of modern Western philosophy. 3. Advancement of scientific knowledge: Greek texts contained pioneering ideas in mathematics, physics, and biology, which laid the foundation for modern scientific inquiry. Figures like Euclid, Archimedes, and Hippocrates had a profound impact on the development of scientific thought during the Renaissance. 4. Inspiration for artistic expression: Greek literature, particularly the works of poets like Homer and playwrights such as Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, fueled the imagination of Renaissance artists and writers and contributed to the development of new literary and artistic styles. 5. Promotion of Humanism: Humanism, a key intellectual movement during the Renaissance, placed a strong emphasis on the study of classical Greek and Roman texts. Humanists believed in the inherent value of human knowledge, reason, and creativity, and the rediscovery of Greek texts helped shape this worldview. The focus on human excellence, reason, and potential drove many Renaissance thinkers to challenge established norms and explore new ideas. 6. Cultural exchange: As Byzantine scholars sought refuge in the West after the fall of Constantinople, they brought with them Greek texts and knowledge, fostering an intellectual exchange between the Eastern and Western worlds. This cross-cultural interaction spurred renewed interest in antiquity and stimulated growth in various disciplines. In summary, Greek texts were important because they preserved valuable knowledge, inspired innovative thinking, and nurtured the spirits of inquiry and creativity that characterized the Italian Renaissance. By reconnecting Western Europe with its classical roots, Greek texts contributed significantly to the intellectual, scientific, and artistic advancements of the period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: Bacteria encode a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein (SSB) crucial for genome maintenance. In Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, an alternative SSB, SsbB, is expressed uniquely during competence for genetic transformation, but its precise role has been disappointingly obscure. Here, we report our investigations involving comparison of a null mutant (ssbB(-)) and a C-ter truncation (ssbBΔ7) of SsbB of S. pneumoniae, the latter constructed because SSBs' acidic tail has emerged as a key site for interactions with partner proteins. We provide evidence that SsbB directly protects internalized ssDNA. We show that SsbB is highly abundant, potentially allowing the binding of ~1.15 Mb ssDNA (half a genome equivalent); that it participates in the processing of ssDNA into recombinants; and that, at high DNA concentration, it is of crucial importance for chromosomal transformation whilst antagonizing plasmid transformation. While the latter observation explains a long-standing observation that plasmid transformation is very inefficient in S. pneumoniae (compared to chromosomal transformation), the former supports our previous suggestion that SsbB creates a reservoir of ssDNA, allowing successive recombination cycles. SsbBΔ7 fulfils the reservoir function, suggesting that SsbB C-ter is not necessary for processing protein(s) to access stored ssDNA. We propose that the evolutionary raison d'être of SsbB and its abundance is maintenance of this reservoir, which contributes to the genetic plasticity of S. pneumoniae by increasing the likelihood of multiple transformation events in the same cell..

Its Solar Impulse vehicle's batteries were damaged on the last leg of the journey from Japan to Hawaii and will take several months to repair. The aircraft will be kept at its Pacific stop-over at Kalaeloa airport while the maintenance is undertaken. Once the work is done there will be some test flights before the global quest resumes in 2016, the team says. That is likely to be in April, and would see Solar Impulse fly from Hawaii to the West Coast of the US. It should then have a sizeable weather window to try to cross America, the Atlantic, and make its way back to Abu Dhabi, UAE, where the circumnavigation began in March this year. The suspension will be a disappointment but the project has already met a number of its key objectives. Pilot Andre Borschberg smashed aviation records when he steered Solar Impulse from Nagoya to Kalaeloa at the beginning of the month. Flying just on the power of the Sun, he completed the 7,200km in 118 hours. Not only did this set several new marks for manned solar aeroplanes, but it surpassed with ease the absolute aviation record for the longest duration solo flight in an un-refuelled vehicle. However, in achieving this mammoth feat, Mr Borschberg's plane experienced damaging overheating in its lithium-ion battery system. Although the battery units performed as expected, they had too much insulation around them, making temperature management very difficult. Engineers on the project have not been able to make the quick repairs that might allow Solar Impulse to have a crack at completing the round-the-world journey this year.

Kim Davis case: Some GOP candidates rally around her Staver later told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper\\" that Davis would issue licenses if her name and title were not on them. \\"Because that in her understanding and mind is authorizing something that is contrary to her Christian values and convictions,\\" he said. \\"That's where the conscience rub is.\\" Earlier Thursday, Bunning remanded Davis into the custody of U.S. marshals for refusing to heed a U.S. Supreme Court order legalizing same-sex marriage, saying she would remain in jail until she complies with the ruling. Bunning then asked Davis' six deputy clerks whether they would issue the licenses, and despite some of them holding the same religious beliefs as Davis, five told Bunning they would issue the licenses. The sixth -- Davis' son, Nathan -- didn't answer. Gov. Steve Beshear said the judge's decision \\"speaks for itself.\\" \\"The future of the Rowan County Clerk continues to be a matter between her and the courts. Deputy clerks have said they will commence issuing marriage licenses beginning (Friday),\\" he said. \\"It appears that the citizens of Rowan County will now have access to all the services from the clerk's office to which they are entitled.\\" The governor said he had no authority to use an executive order to relieve a county clerk of his or her duty. During Davis' hearing, April Miller told the court that the clerk had denied her a marriage license three times, and when Davis took the stand to deliver her at-times emotional testimony, she explained that she could not issue the licenses because of her religious beliefs. \\"You can't be separated from something that's in your heart and in your soul,\\" she told the judge, according to CNN affiliate WKYT-TV. American Civil liberties Union attorneys argued in a motion filed Monday that Davis \\"continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform.\\" They said they didn't want her to be jailed as punishment, but rather, the attorneys asked the court to \\"impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous\\" to make her comply with the court order. Bunning, however, apparently felt she deserved jail time, but he also told Davis she could end her incarceration by complying with the Supreme Court order and telling her deputy clerks to do the same. He said he didn't believe fining Davis would convince her to comply with the high court ruling, especially considering that Davis had testified earlier that her supporters are raising funds for her and calling her office to offer financial support, WKYT reported. Bunning said he, too, was religious, but he explained that when he took his oath to become a judge, that oath trumped his personal beliefs, the station reported. \\"Her good faith belief is simply not a viable defense,\\" Bunning said. Davis thanked the judge for his ruling, according to WKYT. She was not placed in handcuffs, but a U.S. marshal led her out of the courtroom. Celebrations and protests erupted outside the courthouse in Ashland when those who attended the hearing exited the courtroom with news of the decision. Chants of \\"Love won! Love won!\\" filled the air. Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, which represented Davis, said he was \\"stunned\\" by the judge's ruling. \\"Knowing Kim Davis and her strong Christian resolve and convictions, she may be jailed behind bars, but her conscience remains free,\\" he told CNN. He said his client had became a different person 4 1/2 years ago after attending a church service that affected her beliefs. \\"That is the reason why her conscience is so strong,\\" he said. \\"She loves her Lord, she loves God, and she can't disobey her conscience or be disobedient.\\" Davis, an Apostolic Christian who says she has a sincere religious objection to same-sex marriage, has refused to issue any marriage licenses since the Supreme Court decision in June legalizing same-sex marriage. In court documents filed Wednesday, her attorneys argue that she shouldn't be held in contempt. Instead, they argued, there are alternatives that would allow couples to get marriage licenses in Rowan County without going against Davis' religious beliefs. Among the options they offered were allowing other officials to issue marriage licenses in the county, distributing marriage licenses at the state level or changing marriage license forms to remove Davis' name. A seat inside the courtroom was a hot ticket. Before the session began, more than 100 people were turned away from Bunning's courtroom, which holds 300 people. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that because of the controversy surrounding the case, Bunning was provided with a security escort on his way into work. A large crowd, leaning mostly in support of Davis, gathered outside the courthouse before the hearing, many carrying signs. \\"Jesus Saves\\" read one, \\"Homo sex is sin,\\" read another, while one sign pointed passers-by to the Bible's Acts 5:29, which quotes Peter and other apostles saying, \\"We must obey God rather than human beings!\\" Lana Bailey of Worthington, about a 20-minute drive northwest of Ashland, brought signs as well, both of which seemed to address Davis: \\"My gay friends pay taxes which helps pay you... right??\\" and \\"Respect the law; do your job!\\" \\"I'm here to support equal rights for all,\\" she said. \\"It's just called respect. I don't understand why we're having this. Why are we spending money on this? ... If you can't do your job then you need to step down. You need to resign.\\" Jason Porter, a pastor at Ashland's Gospel Light Baptist Church, spoke for the other side and said he wasn't at the courthouse \\"to bash people's decisions and lifestyles,\\" but he worried that if people were allowed to continue doing whatever they want to do, \\"the floodgates will open to other areas of polygamy.\\" He did not elaborate on how same-sex marriage was akin to polygamy, which is the act of having multiple spouses. Polygamy is illegal in every state. Echoing those who cited Acts 5:29, he said he felt Davis had a right to refuse to issue the marriage license and, waving his Bible, he told CNN he bore no hatred toward gay couples and is merely standing \\"for the truths of my God's word.\\" \\"I just know the destruction that this brings. As a pastor, I see the background. I see the broken families. I see the AIDS. I see the folks dying of diseases and the brokenness of relationships,\\" he said. Two other county clerks in Kentucky are also refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses, according to a statement on Beshear's website. Bunning ordered Davis to resume the issuing of marriage licenses on August 12. Monday night, the Supreme Court denied an emergency application from Davis, who asked that Bunning's order be put on hold pending appeal. In a statement released Tuesday, Davis, a Democrat, said she has received death threats but intends to continue to serve as the county clerk -- a position she was elected to fill in November. In court papers, attorneys for Davis argued that she is unable to comply with the court orders because issuing same-sex marriage licenses \\"irreparably and irreversibly violates her conscience.\\" Finding her in contempt of court, they argued in the motion filed Wednesday, also would \\"substantially burden Davis' religious exercise.\\" Related: Court clerk who won't issue marriage licenses has been divorced three times But some scoff at the clerk, suggesting she's a hypocrite because she's been divorced three times. Davis said she's a different person now since becoming a Christian four years ago. \\"I am not perfect,\\" she said in a statement. \\"No one is. But I am forgiven.\\" The ACLU attorneys, who represent two same-sex couples and two opposite-sex couples who want to get married in Rowan County, argued that Davis has no legal basis to avoid performing her duties as a government clerk. And a federal prosecutor said it's time for Davis and her county to comply. \\"Government officials are free to disagree with the law, but not disobey it,\\" U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said in a statement. \\"The County Clerk has presented her position through the federal court system, all of the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is time for the Clerk and the County to follow the law.\\" CNN's Sonia Moghe, Alexandra Field, Ariane de Vogue and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","completion":"Kim Davis, a county clerk, has been sent to jail because she refused to follow a new law that says it is okay for people of the same sex to get married. She believes it is wrong due to her religious beliefs. Her lawyers said she would be okay with giving out marriage licenses if her name was not on them. As of now, she will stay in jail until she agrees to follow the law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Before I give Spike Lee's mess of a film SUMMER OF SAM a well-deserved thrashing, I would like to make one thing clear. I do not revile this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images. What makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that Lee seems to believe that SUMMER OF SAM should be taken seriously as a socially enlightening drama. The crime caper films of Quentin Tarantino, for example, are filled with violence, profanity, and other sleaze, but are nonetheless highly watchable because Tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art. He knows that such films are for entertainment value only. On the other hand, serious dramas such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST are often unpleasant to watch, but the unpleasantness serves to develop the film's plot and characters, with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters onscreen. SUMMER OF SAM, unfortunately, merely wallows in its own sensationalism and sleaze, while believing that it is serving as social commentary, much like other trash epics . SUMMER OF SAM does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboard-cutout stereotypes. Its plot purports to show the emotional impact of the hysteria over the Son of Sam murders on the residents of the predominately Italian-American north Bronx neighborhood where the murders ocurred. However, instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities, Lee simply wheels out every negative Italian stereotype imaginable. The men are ignorant, lazy, oversexed goombahs. The women are split between weak, complacent \\"good girls\\" (Mira Sorvino's Dionna) and promiscuous \\"bad girls\\" (Jennifer Esposito's Ruby). Lee seems to vindictively wants to \\"payback\\" Hollywood for their years of negative African-American stereotyping by wheeling out stereotypes of his own, and few critics seem to care. If Martin Scorsese, for example, presented residents of an African-American neighborhood as a bunch of Amos 'n Andy and Aunt Jemima stereotypes, critics would rightfully condemn such blatant stereotyping. More importantly, one-dimensional, stereotypical characters undermine any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary. Without exception, the cast of SUMMER OF SAM is excellent. However, the acting, for the most part, is uninspired. The cast is either just going through the motions, or they have little to work with scriptwise. Additionally, there is notable miscasting. Comedian John Leguizamo is very talented, but his Vinny character seems to be a stale, comedic impersonation of John Travolta's Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. And Michael Badalucco, a perennial \\"nice guy\\" actor, is badly miscast as serial killer David Berkowitz, coming across as funny rather than frightening. The only performance worth paying attention to is Adrien Brody as the troubled, but sincere, neighborhood misfit Ritchie. The Brody performance and the typically stylish Lee cinematography are this film's only virtues. *1/2 out of **** How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is highly negative and critical towards the film SUMMER OF SAM. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the movie, including its perceived misuse of stereotypes, weak character development, and a sense of misplaced seriousness in its approach to social commentary. This negative sentiment is only briefly interrupted by the reviewer's appreciation for Adrien Brody's performance and the film's cinematography."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a question about the following article: At home for the first time in three weeks, the Patriots, looking to remain unbeaten, faced off against the 4-2 Redskins. After spending the first seven weeks of the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list, defensive end Richard Seymour was activated for the game, but did not start. Following a Redskins punt, in their first possession of the game, the Patriots drove 90&#160;yards over more than 7&#160;minutes, finishing the drive with a 3-yard Brady rushing touchdown, continuing a season-long opening drive scoring streak. The teams exchanged punts into the second quarter, before a 67-yard Patriots drive was capped off with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Vrabel, his second for the season and the tenth of his career (including playoffs). On the Redskins' ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of Jason Campbell at the Redskins' 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by Phillip Daniels at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&#160;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&#160;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&#160;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins' 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24-0 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in 2004 and 2002, but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games. On the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&#160;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots' lead to 38-0. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots' 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&#160;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45-0. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots' next series, Cassel replaced Brady. A 21-yard pass from Cassel to Gaffney gave the Patriots their 33rd first down of the game, a new single-game franchise record. Two plays later, Cassel ran it in for a touchdown from 15&#160;yards out, and the first rushing touchdown of his career, increasing the Patriots' lead to 52-0; the touchdown was the longest rushing touchdown by a Patriots quarterback in more than 20 years. The Redskins then drove 63&#160;yards and scored their only points of the game on a 15-yard Chris Cooley touchdown reception. Third-string quarterback Matt Gutierrez replaced Cassel on the next possession, a three-and-out. The Redskins then punted back to the Patriots to end the game. The Patriots' 52-7 win gave them an 8-0 record heading into a Week 9 matchup against the 7-0 Colts. It also made Brady only the second quarterback to defeat the other 31 teams at least once; the Colts' Peyton Manning was the first to accomplish the feat, having done so earlier that day.","completion":"In the article detailing the Patriots' home game after three weeks away, in which they aimed to maintain their unbeaten record against the 4-2 Redskins, how did the activation of defensive end Richard Seymour, who had spent the first seven weeks on the Physically Unable to Perform list, impact the game?

Construction workers were trying to lower the Bay Crane Company crawler crane and secure it as 25 mph winds whipped through the area about 8:24 a.m., when it flipped over, sending its 565-foot-long arm careening onto Worth Street stretching from West Broadway to Church Street, officials said. Harvard-educated trader David Wichs, 38, (inset) was crushed to death by a falling crane Friday morning. (Photo by DNAinfo/Megan Cerullo/Facebook) Crews had been directing pedestrian and road traffic away from Worth Street before the crane fell, officials said. Eyewitness Tony Menendez, a Telx employee at 60 Hudson St., watched the operator lower the boom amid the intensifying weather conditions, he said. \\"It started getting windy,\\" Menendez said. \\"The crane was coming down. It got to a certain pitch like this,\\" he said, holding his arm at 45-degree angle. \\"And then all of the sudden the wind started picking up and it came straight down.\\" WARNING: Video contains profanity. Video of the crane collapse Posted by Lou Young on Friday, February 5, 2016 Three men on the street at the time bolted for cover, he said. \\"There were three guys up front. Two guys ran to the right and one guy ran to the left. I believe who ran to the left was killed.\\" The toppling crane slammed into some nearby buildings and shook others when it hit the ground, neighbors said. Menendez said that police frantically tried to pull the man out from under the crumpled equipment. Officials confirmed that one man, David Wichs, 38, who reports said emigrated from Prague and lived on the Upper West Side, was killed on the street. Sergeants Benevolent Association Vice President Bob Ganley, whose office window overlooks the street, saw the boom drop. He and two coworkers raced to the scene and found a man sitting in a crushed car. Miraculously, the man was unharmed, he said. They found Wichs laying on the side walk and put a blanket over him. The impact of the equipment shook the neighborhood. \\"It sounded like a bomb,\\" said Mark Melville, a construction worker at a nearby site. \\"I look over and I see the bricks were flying up the block,\\" Melville added. Falling debris injured another three people, officials said. Two people — a 45-year-old woman, a 73-year-old man — were treated for serious injuries at Bellevue while a another only suffered minor injuries, officials said. \\"Our hearts go out to the families of the individual who was lost and all those who were injured,\\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a press conference Friday morning. Wichs immigrated to the United States as a teen, later earned a mathematics degree from Harvard and was worked at the financial trading firm Tower Research Capital, according to the Associated Press. He graduated from Harvard, where he was co-chairman of the campus Hillel group, in 2000, the university said. Wichs was \\"the most brilliant person ever,\\" his sister-in-law told the wire service. Menendez said the crane operator survived the crash. \\"It's a miracle there wasn't more of an impact. Thank God we didn't have more injuries and we didn't lose more people,\\" de Blasio said. Officials with both Galasso Trucking, which operates the crane, and the Bay Crane Company, which owns it, declined to comment. \\"I believe they were doing the right thing bringing it down, but somebody should have looked at the weather last night,\\" Menendez said. NYPD detectives were interviewing the crane's operator to determine if any criminality was involved in the deadly collapse, police officials said. The crane had been replacing air conditioners and generators atop 60 Hudson St., the former Western Union headquarters, officials said. The crane was erected a week before and crews had added an extension on Thursday to better reach the roof, officials said. The Department of Buildings had visited the site that day and approved the work that was being done there, officials said. A woman who lives nearby said she saw work men putting plywood in front of the crane's tracks to help it gain traction. \\"They inched the crane forward. They couldn't move it so they put large pieces of plywood, they put them in front of each of the two treads — 3 or 4 sheets,\\" said artist Vivien Collens, who watched the work from her fourth floor window. \\"[He] started move it forward,\\" she said. \\"The moment after he started to move it forward, it slipped and somersaulted.

A crane collapsed in Lower Manhattan Friday morning, crushing a row of parked cars and leaving one person dead and two others seriously hurt. A fourth victim suffered only minor injuries.The massive crane came crashing down at Worth and Church streets in TriBeCa just before 8:30 a.m., clipping at least one building in the process.The construction crane, owned by Bay Crane and operated by Galasso Trucking and Rigging, was previously positioned as high as 20 stories and now stretches across several blocks. David Wichs -- a 38-year-old pedestrian who lives on the Upper West Side -- was pronounced dead at the scene , while two others were rescued from vehicles before being rushed to the hospital. A 45-year-old woman identified as Dawn Kojima, of Nutley, suffered a leg injury, while 73-year-old Thomas O'Brien sustained a laceration to the head.Mayor Bill de Blasio said the crane was being moved into a secure position because of high winds when the incident occurred. The crane was last inspected Thursday morning, and no work was being done at the site Friday. He said crews were keeping people and traffic away from the scene as the crane was being lowered, which likely prevented the injury total from being higher.No workers were injured, and the 56-year-old crane operator is cooperating with detectives and tested negative for alcohol.The force of the collapse caused a water main break at Worth Street and West Broadway and a possible gas main break on the West Broadway side.The FDNY and Con Edison are on the scene working on the gas issue, and spokesperson Sidney Alvarez is warning everyone in the area to be aware of an odor of rotten eggs. Anyone who smells such an odor is urged to contact Con Ed or dial 911.At this point, no elevated gas levels have been reported.The New York City Office of Emergency Management says there is no structural damage to any of the impacted buildings. Officials said four structures were damaged, most on the first floor. Still, several office buildings in the area were evacuated. They include:NY Law School (four buildings)71 Thomas Street, which is a state Supreme Court building40 Worth Street, which is a large office building. Weill Cornell Medicine has practices in that building and said everyone was evacuated safely.No residential buildings were evacuated.Worth Street is closed from Church Street to Hudson Street, while West Broadway is closed south of Canal Street.It appears the crane was working on 60 Hudson Street, a longtime industrial building undergoing renovation to luxury apartments. The crane was parked on Worth Street and had been lifting wood and other equipment to the roof.The plan is to start dismantling the crane Saturday morning.

Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose 25 books include \\"Late Edition: A Love Story\\"; \\"When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams\\"; and \\"Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen.\\" (CNN) -- Attention, holiday shoppers: Put away your wallets and credit cards. If you're looking for a gift that will please someone close to you, there's one that won't cost you a cent, and that you won't find on any store shelf. This thought occurred the other day when, on a visit to the west coast of Florida, I was walking through a crowded outdoor mall and the familiar voice of Frank Sinatra wafted out of the loudspeaker system: \\"If I don't see her each day I miss her. . . .\\" I recognized the song immediately. \\"Believe me, I've got a case, \\"On Nancy, with the laughing face. . . .\\" It's one of the songs Sinatra cherished most. And what does that have to do with the most meaningful present you can give to a loved one this holiday season? There's a story behind the song: a story with a lesson. In the early 1940s, when Sinatra was a relatively young man, he and his wife were having a birthday party for their firstborn child, Nancy. Among the invited guests were two good friends of Sinatra: the wonderful musical composer Jimmy Van Heusen, and the brilliant comedic actor Phil Silvers. Van Heusen and Silvers wanted to bring a gift. But what could they purchase that Sinatra himself could not provide for his daughter? What the two men did was revise a song they'd been working on. Van Heusen had written the melody; Silvers was the writer of the lyrics. (He would go on to immense fame in the 1950s playing Army Sgt. Ernest Bilko on CBS television, but his talents extended to many fields.) Their song, in an early version, had featured the words \\"Bessie, with the laughing face,\\" referring to the wife of a colleague. Now they worked some more on it, and fashioned the lyrics for Sinatra's young daughter. They played and sang it at the birthday party. Sinatra adored it; by some accounts, he was so moved by the gesture from his friends that he began to cry. Talk about a gift for the man who has everything: What are you going to give to Frank Sinatra that he will remember? A tie? A car? A bottle of liquor? He needed nothing. But that song, and the effort his two friends had put into it, touched him so deeply that, until his dying day, it signified something achingly personal to him. And now it's the holiday season. We've all read about the mobs of people at door-buster sales, the fights in the aisles of stores. Yet there is a way that each of us, if we are willing to invest the hours, can come up with a gift that will mean more than any flat-screen television or video game. If you're good with words, write the best and longest letter you've ever written to a family member who maybe doesn't know just what he or she means to you. That letter will be kept, and treasured, long after gifts bought in a store have worn out or been thrown away. If you're artistic, paint a picture with a special significance that the person you love will understand. If you're the organized type, gather family photos from over the years, select them carefully, and put them together in an album that will mean everything to the person who receives it. If you're musical ... well, do for the person you care about what Phil Silvers and Jimmy Van Heusen did for Frank Sinatra and his family. Will the effort be time-consuming? Yes, and that's the point. It will certainly be time better spent than standing in line for hours before some big-box store opens its doors for midnight bargains. Because I'd heard about the Sinatra story for so many years, I called his younger daughter Tina the other afternoon to ask her about its veracity -- and its meaning to her family. \\"All of it is true,\\" she said. She said that her dad, Silvers and Van Heusen were dear buddies who loved to spend time together: \\"There would be New Year's Eve parties where they'd set up a stage, and play charades games. Everyone had to participate. They just liked being around each other.\\" When the two men presented the song at the birthday party, she said, \\"It was done out of pure friendship.\\" Her father and her mother -- whose name was also Nancy -- couldn't have been more moved by the personal nature of the gift. Tina had not yet been born, but the reason she is certain of this, she said, is that her dad talked about it, from time to time, for the rest of his life. And for him, the song -- and the memories of his friends who wrote it -- never diminished in emotional power. She recalled one time in Paris when her dad was in a brittle mood over some things that were going on in his life. He was angry and irritable; at a concert, as he worked his way through his song list, his agitation was evident to everyone who knew him. But then he got to \\"Nancy (with the Laughing Face)\\". \\"His entire physicality changed,\\" Tina said. 'He relaxed. He calmed down. The gentleness of the song, and the meaning of the story behind it, did that to him. You could see it. He went from being tense and on edge to being like an at-ease sergeant.\\" The gift from his buddies did that for him, all those years later. The best gifts are like that. Here's hoping you'll find the right one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV. - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster.

Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993.

They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner. - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed.

In this task, you will be given a passage to read. A fill in the blank question will be given to you. Your answer should fit the blank appropriately. In January 1844 , North Carolina Representative James Iver McKay , the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means , solicited the views of Director Patterson on the gold dollar . Patterson had more of Gobrecht 's pattern dollar struck to show to committee members , again advising against a coin that if issued would be only about a half inch ( 13 mm ) in diameter . He told Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer that the only gold coins of that size in commerce , the Spanish and Colombian half @-@ escudos , were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years . This seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time , and when a gold dollar was proposed again in 1846 , McKay 's committee recommended against it . Even before 1848 , record amounts of gold were flowing to American mints to be struck into coin , but the California Gold Rush vastly increased these quantities . This renewed calls for a gold dollar , as well as for a higher denomination than the eagle ( 10 piece ) , then the largest gold coin . In January 1849 , McKay introduced a bill for a gold dollar , which was referred to his committee . There was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin ; one newspaper published a proposal for an annular gold dollar , that is , with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter . McKay amended his legislation to provide for a double eagle ( 20 gold coin ) and wrote to Patterson , who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work , and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold plug in a silver coin . Nevertheless , Gobrecht 's successor as chief engraver , James B. Longacre , prepared patterns , including some with a square hole in the middle . McKay got his fellow Democrat , New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton , to introduce the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1 , 1849 — Atherton was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . McKay introduced a version into the House on February 20 ; debate began the same day . The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the Whig Party , then in the minority , on the grounds that it would be too small , would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime , the coins being similar in size . McKay did not respond substantively , but stated that if no one wanted these denominations , they would not be called for at the Mint , and would not be coined . Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll , a Whig , spoke against the bill , noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations , and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down , whenever considered . Another Whig , Massachusetts 's Charles Hudson , related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference . McKay made no answer to these claims , but others did , including New York Congressman Henry Nicoll , who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated . The point was , he indicated , that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public , and , in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted . Connecticut Representative John A. Rockwell , a Whig , tried to table the bill , but his motion was defeated . The bill passed easily , and met only minimal opposition in the Senate , becoming law on March 3 , 1849 . fill in the blank : In January 1844 , North Carolina Representative James Iver __________________ , the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means , solicited the views of Director Patterson on the gold dollar .

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Confidentiality agreements typically limit the ways the receiving party can use the confidential information provided, as well as provide the standard for keeping and protecting confidential information. For example, if you're looking for investor evaluations of something you've invented, your confidentiality agreement may specify that the information can only be used for the purposes of evaluating the product and not in the evaluator's own business. If you're having an employee or contractor sign a confidentiality agreement, you would probably want to limit your employee's use of information to the performance of job duties directly related to the employment. Many confidentiality agreements recite that receivers must keep the information disclosed to them in the same way they would keep their own confidential information. However, this statement only works if the receiving party has a known policy for handling confidential information. Generally, confidentiality standards include limiting access to the information and taking basic precautions to keep the information secure so it doesn't easily fall into outside hands. Such precautions might include, for example, using encryption for emails discussing the confidential information. If your confidentiality agreement relates to software designs, inventions or technology, it should include a statement that the receiver of the information has no license, expressed or implied, in the information by virtue of its disclosure. Most state laws hold that, at a minimum, the receiver has the duty not to breach confidentiality or induce others to breach it. Your agreement should specify two time periods: the period during which disclosure will be made, and the time period thereafter during which the information should be kept confidential. American confidentiality agreements typically last for a period of five years, although some may only last two or three years. The end point doesn't have to be a specific date, but there should be a specific date used as a starting point. Otherwise it's unclear when the agreement will take effect and for how long it will be enforceable. If your agreement specifies a confidentiality period of two years, for example, but fails to establish when that two year period starts, the receiver of the information can argue that she didn't believe the agreement had gone into effect yet. Another way to set a specific starting date is to have the confidentiality period start from the date the agreement is signed. If you use this method, make sure you don't disclose any secrets until you have the signature and the agreement is in force. The confidentiality time period also may end when a certain event happens. For example, if you're seeking evaluation of a new product, the confidentiality period may end when you market and distribute that product in stores. Some confidentiality agreements include stiff financial penalties if secret information is revealed to the general public. Others leave the consequences up to a judge or arbitrator to decide. You can sue for an injunction -- a court order to stop the person who breached confidentiality from continuing to share the information in violation of the agreement. You also have the ability to sue for damages incurred as a result of the breach of confidentiality, which may include penalties. For example, in some states you may have the ability to get double or triple damages if the breach was intentional rather than accidental. How detailed you want to get with penalties generally relates to how unique the information being disclosed is, and how damaging it would be if it got out. The more difficult something is to value, the more likely there is to be a clause listing a specific dollar amount in damages for breach. If both parties agree the information is worth this amount, the issue isn't left up to the discretion of a judge. Sometimes called “boilerplate,” all agreements contain various clauses that don't fit in any other section, such as which state's law will apply and whether attorneys' fees will be available to an injured party if they agreement is breached. Both parties must sign the agreement before it can be considered valid.","completion":"The article discusses the importance of confidentiality agreements, their role in limiting the use of confidential information, and the protection they provide for sensitive data. It covers various aspects such as the purpose of the agreement, the standard of care to be taken while handling confidential information, period of disclosure and confidentiality, establishing a specific starting date for the agreement, the possible consequences of breach and penalties, setting a specific dollar amount for damages, and the inclusion of boilerplate clauses to address additional legal matters. The article also highlights the need for both parties to sign the agreement for it to be considered valid and enforceable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:Richard Barklie, from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, is one of four fans facing a football banning order over a racist confrontation filmed ahead of a Champions League game in February. The footage showed several fans chanting: \\"We're racist and that's the way we like it.\\" Mr Barklie denies chanting. The Metropolitan Police is applying for football banning orders to be imposed on four men the force believes were involved in the confrontation. In addition to Mr Barklie, 50, of Victoria Street in Carrickfergus, Jordan Munday, 20, of Ellenborough Road, Sidcup, Kent; Josh Parsons, 20, of Woodhouse Place, Dorking, Surrey; and William Simpson, 26, of Hengrove Crescent in Ashford, Surrey, are challenging the ban. The banning orders would prevent them from attending games at home or abroad. Scotland Yard confirmed another Chelsea supporter, Dean Callis, 32, of Liverpool Road, Islington, had received a five-year banning order ahead of the court hearing for a number of incidents, including the one in Paris. The prosecution said Mr Barklie \\"was present in the group, pushed the victim twice and joined in the chanting\\". The alleged victim, a French commuter known only as Souleymane S, previously said the whole episode was \\"humiliating\\". Mr Barklie's lawyer Nick Scott told the court his client had pushed him off the train because it was busy and there was not enough space. He said: \\"There are three people in the way filling up the door. He's just pushed off - no violence or aggression.\\" The Thames Magistrates' Court hearing, sitting in Stratford, continues.

Hypothesis: The man is talented. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the man is talented. The premise only describes the physical appearance of a pedestrian - slinging a guitar and carrying a backpack in a metro setting. Although this may suggest that the individual has an interest in playing guitar and possibly possesses some skill in doing so, we cannot assert for certain that the individual is talented solely because they are carrying a guitar. However, we can make educated assumptions or construct alternative hypotheses based on the given premise, which may lead us closer to identifying the level of talent present. It is essential to gather more information on the pedestrian's actual musical abilities before making a valid conclusion. Some alternative hypotheses that could be derived from the premise are: 1. The pedestrian is an aspiring musician who is currently learning how to play the guitar. In this case, the man may be talented but is still in the initial stages of honing his skills. 2. The pedestrian is a professional musician who carries his essential gear as he travels between gigs in the metro setting. A skilled musician could indicate some level of talent. 3. The pedestrian is carrying the guitar as a means to express himself or his identity, rather than reflecting his ability to play. It may be a fashion statement or an accessory without necessarily demonstrating any level of talent. In summary, the given premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the man is talented. However, we can infer that the pedestrian might have some interest in music or guitar playing. To have a more accurate conclusion of his talent, we would need to obtain more information about the pedestrian's background, experiences, and musical skill level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Crucifixion of Jesus: The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails. However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails. These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion. In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross. The tradition also carries to Christian emblems, e.g. the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion. Please answer a question about this article.

It can be something like “I need to leave now” or even something silly like “My monster needs me.” It’s about trying to keep the person bullying you off-balance. This often confuses the bully enough that he or she is less sure of how you will respond the next time the possibility of bullying arises. Bullying often follows a script, and you want to change it so the bully is off-balance. If you are a bystander and see someone being bullied, try to create a distraction or take the bully's attention off of what he's doing. You can also provide an interruption by telling the person being bullied like, \\"Hey, I really need to talk to you for a second\\" or \\"Mr. X wants to see you for a minute.\\" If they follow you, or it happens again and you feel comfortable doing so, ask the person to stop. If the person refuses, detail the steps you will take to deal with the situation. For example, you can say something like, \\"Please stop calling me mean names. If you don't, I will report you to the principal.\\" It's important not to give bullying an audience if you're a bystander. Attention will only encourage the bully. Don't laugh at or encourage bullying behavior. If it feels safe, you can even say something like, \\"That's really not funny\\" or \\"Take it easy.\\" No matter how the person who is bullying you responds, staying calm will show them their efforts to upset you aren’t working. Show that you are unaffected by their actions, even if you are inside. Write down as exactly as you can what they said and did and who was there. This can help when you talk to teachers or people in authority about the situation. Letting people in authority know will make it harder for the person who does the bullying to continue. You might not be the only one suffering, and it might be time for the school administration to take action against that person. It’s important to have a record of complaint against the person doing the bullying in case it continues. If the verbal abuse has taken the form of sexist, racist, or homophobic slurs, you also might want to reach out to teachers involved in student groups trying to combat sexism, racism, and homophobia. Change your routes. Go with a crowd whenever you can. Bullies often avoid taking on someone with a group around them. If the bullying consists of any physical violence, go to the police immediately. Threats of violence should also be reported to the police, as they are illegal in many jurisdictions. Being the target of bullying is not your fault. No one should have to deal with bullying, social isolation, and shaming alone. Even if people who were your friends have gotten involved in the social bullying situation, look for new activities and new friends. Get yourself out of the toxic situation. If needed, speaking with a school counselor, joining a \\"beat-bullying\\" group, or seeing a therapist may also help with your emotional pain.

A tarantula attacks Sir Henry briefly in London; Holmes suspects foul play. Before he leaves, Holmes reminds Watson not to let Sir Henry go out onto the moor after dark. On the way to Baskerville Hall, the coach driver, Perkins (Sam Kydd), warns that a convict named Selden (Michael Mulcaster) has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison two days ago. Watson remembers the case: Selden was convicted of murdering a number of street women; due to his being found insane, he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of hanging. At Baskerville Hall, Watson and Sir Henry learn from the butler, Barrymore (John Le Mesurier), that one of the two paintings of Sir Hugo was stolen several months ago. Watson then inquires Barrymore about further details of Sir Charles's death since Barrymore was the first to discover the body. Barrymore explains that he was on his way to warn Dr. Mortimer of Sir Charles's disappearance and then found the body by chance.

But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength .

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers? from the following article ? Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;...

The Covent Garden area has over 60 pubs and bars; several of them are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have received consumer awards. The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller's Brewery in 2014. It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners. The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname \\"Bucket of Blood\\". The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.The Salisbury in St Martin's Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as \\"good fin de siècle ensemble\\".

I decided to celebrate the unofficial return of reasonable driving vacations with a venture to the ultimate temple of excess -- Hearst Castle. From Los Angeles, my family and I retraced the journey of Hollywood luminaries who headed north to hang out with publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Gregory Peck, Carol Lombard and Hearst's mistress Marion Davies all made the trek to what Hearst called \\"La Cuesta Encantada,\\" or the Enchanted Hill. Winston Churchill and President Calvin Coolidge also rested here amid art and antiquities from around the world. Hearst Castle looks down over golden fields, the glistening Pacific and the town of San Simeon, California, home to less than 500 people. We took a tour bus from the visitors center to the mansion, a long gull's dive from the ocean, 1,610 feet above sea level. Hearst hired San Francisco architect Julia Morgan in 1919 and by 1947 the 165-room estate stretched over 127 acres. It's crystal clear Hearst was a demanding mastermind of his kingdom on the hill, putting Morgan through what must have been agonizing brain twisters. Visitors see that when Hearst wanted European choir chairs wedged into his assembly room, Morgan made it work. When he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from Europe, Morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms. A massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and Vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property. Our guide recounted Hearst house rules. In an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, Hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. The Hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game. Guests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures. Hearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend Marion Davies. Though Hearst remained married to Millicent Hearst, with whom he had five children, Davies' ghost is everywhere at Hearst Castle. Images of the actress, along with Charlie Chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater. Museum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate Flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the Morning Room. Owing to my Belgian roots, I looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, \\"No wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a Girl Scout vest.\\" The castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. We saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient Egyptian statues or towering Christmas trees. \\"This guy was rich!\\" my friend's 7-year-old-son, Nicolas, exclaimed. Perhaps a headline from Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in another era could best describe our trip:. \\"The road to fun is back and affordable!\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about a family taking a road trip to visit Hearst Castle, a big, fancy house built by a rich man named William Randolph Hearst. Many famous people used to visit him there, like Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, and even a president! The house has a big pool and lots of beautiful and interesting things gathered from all around the world. The family enjoyed their trip, and even young kids were amazed by how fancy the house was."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Could dark matter fill 'empty' space and be displaced by matter? Could the Milky Way's halo be the state of displacement of the dark matter? Are galaxy filaments the state of displacement of the strongly interacting dark matter which fills 'empty' space? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Imagine you have a room filled with invisible and mysterious stuff called dark matter. It's everywhere in the room, even when it looks empty. Now, when you place a toy (like a ball) in the room, the dark matter has to move a little to make room for it. This is what we mean by displacement - the dark matter moves to give space to something else. Now, let's talk about the Milky Way. Picture it as a big spinning toy in the room. It has a halo, which is an area surrounding the spinning toy, and some people think it's made up of dark matter. So, the Milky Way's halo might be the area where the dark matter has moved away to make room for the galaxy. Galaxy filaments are like big strings that connect many toys (galaxies) together. Think of them like strings on a necklace holding many beads. Some people think these galaxy filaments are also made up of dark matter that has moved and gathered together, just like the Milky Way's halo. Now, let's see if these questions have the same meaning. The first question is about if dark matter can fill 'empty' space and move to make room for other things like galaxies. The second question is about whether the Milky Way's halo and galaxy filaments could be areas where dark matter has moved. They have a similar idea because they both talk about dark matter moving and organizing itself around other things. But they're not exactly the same, as the first one is more general, and the second one specifically talks about the Milky Way's halo and galaxy filaments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87–85. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113–91 and evening the series up at 1–1. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104–103. Though Manu Ginóbili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123–118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime.

Here is a goal: How do you poke holes in polymer clay beads before they're baked? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of poking holes in polymer clay beads before they're baked, you will need to follow a series of specific steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials: - Polymer clay (in the desired colors) - Round bead- or lentil-shape maker (optional) - Needle, toothpick, or bead-piercing tool - Cornstarch or water (to prevent clay from sticking) - Flat working surface - Wax paper or plastic sheet (to prevent clay from staining your work surface) - Oven-safe baking sheet or glass (for baking) - Oven or toaster oven (for baking) 2. Prepare your work area: - Place your flat working surface, such as a cutting board or table, in a well-lit area. - Lay down wax paper or a plastic sheet to prevent the clay from adhering to your work surface. - Preheat your oven or toaster oven according to the polymer clay manufacturer's instructions. 3. Condition the clay: - Before shaping the beads, you will need to soften and condition the polymer clay by kneading it with your hands or running it through a pasta machine a few times. This step is crucial for achieving a uniform consistency, which will result in better quality beads. 4. Shape the beads: - Using the conditioned clay, shape your beads by rolling small portions of the clay into rounds or lentil shapes. You can use a round bead- or lentil-shape maker for more precise and uniform shapes. - The size and shape of the beads are entirely customizable, depending on your preference or project requirements. 5. Poke the holes: - Before you pierce the bead, decide on the orientation of the hole (horizontal or vertical in relation to the bead) by considering your final jewelry design. - Lightly dust the needle, toothpick, or bead-piercing tool with cornstarch or dip it in water to prevent the clay from sticking to the tool. - Gently press the needle or toothpick into the bead at the desired entry point. Rotate the tool as you push, maintaining a slow and steady pressure. This will help reduce distortion in the bead's shape. - Carefully push the tool through until you feel it exit the other side. Pull the tool straight out, being mindful of the bead's shape. - Check the hole's size and adjust it by gently rotating the tool or using a larger tool, if necessary. - If the bead's shape gets distorted, reshape it gently with your fingers, taking care not to close the hole. 6. Smooth the holes: - For a polished look, smooth out the edges of the holes by gently rubbing your fingers around the entry and exit points or using a small, clean brush. 7. Bake the beads: - Place the beads on an oven-safe baking sheet or glass dish, ensuring that they don't touch each other to prevent melting. - Bake the polymer clay beads according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually around 250-275°F (120-135°C) for 15 to 30 minutes. Baking time may vary depending on the thickness of the beads. - After baking, remove the beads from the oven and allow them to cool completely before handling. 8. Finish and use the beads: - Your polymer clay beads are now ready to be used in your jewelry-making projects. If desired, you can further embellish them with paint, varnish, or other finishes to create unique, eye-catching pieces. By following these steps, you'll be able to create beautiful and evenly-shaped polymer clay beads with securely poked holes, ready for various applications and craft projects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you want the dye to appear like it does on the packaging, you need to start with a white base. If you prefer a muted shade, however, you could start with gray linen instead. You can try dyeing a cotton-linen or rayon-linen blend, but be aware that the results may not be consistent or even. If you are working with yarn, wind the yarn around your hand and elbow to create a large hank. Loosely tie pieces of string around the hank to secure it. Use a funnel to fill a large jug with 1 cup (140 g) of soda ash. Add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water that is around 105 °F (41 °C). Close the jug and shake it to dissolve the soda ash. Open the jug and set it aside so that the water can cool. Use pure soda ash (sodium carbonate), not baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). You can find it online and in well-stocked craft stores. If you have hard water in your town or city, add some water softener. This will prevent the minerals from affecting the dye. Place your fabric or yarn into a plastic tub. Fill it with enough of the soda ash solution to completely cover the linen. Let the linen soak for at least 20 minutes. Save the rest of the soda ash for later. The soda ash solution can still be hot for this step. Each brand will be a little different, but in most cases, you will have to mix 2 teaspoons of fabric reactive dye powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Mix the dye with a little bit of warm water to form a paste first, then add the rest of the water. Wear safety googles and rubber of plastic gloves to protect your eyes and skin. Wear a dusk mask approved for fine particles for this step. Powdered fabric reactive dye is dangerous to breathe in. Use less dye for a lighter shade and more dye for a darker shade. You don't have to use an applicator bottle if you won't want to, but many people find it easier to use than just pouring the dye from the container your prepared it in. How much more dye you prepare depends on how much linen you are dyeing; refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more advice. Take the linen out of the soda ash bath, and squeeze out the excess solution. Set the linen down onto a plastic tray or bag, then squirt the dye onto it. You can create an all-over solid color or a splotchy color. You can even use multiple colors to create a tie dye effect. Keep color mixing in mind. If you put 2 contrasting colors next to each other, they will form brown then they touch. Squeeze the linen after you apply the dye, then apply more dye if needed. If you dyed your linen multiple colors, be careful not to bundle it up. Arrange the linen so that no 2 colors touch or smoosh together. Zip or tie the bag shut, and leave it in a warm place for 12 to 24 hours. The place should be at least 65 °F (18 °C). The longer you leave the linen in the bag, the brighter and more vibrant the colors will turn out. Don't worry, fiber reactive dyes are non-toxic, so they won't harm the environment or waterways. The soda ash can also unblock clogs in your sink! Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. It would be a good idea to rinse the linen afterwards with Synthrapol, which helps set the dye into the linen better. You need to use Synthrapol with hot water; follow the instructions on the bottle. Make sure that no soda ash remains inn the linen before you start. Squeeze the linen with your hands until you get most of the water out. Spread it out on an old towel in a well-ventilated area away from sunlight. Allow it to air dry completely before using the fabric or yarn. Once the yarn is dry, snip the strings holding the skein together, then roll the skein into a ball.","completion":"To obtain the desired color for dyeing linen fabric or yarn, it is crucial to start with the appropriate base. Dye is translucent, meaning it mixes with the existing color of your material. Using a white base will help achieve colors similar to those displayed on dye packaging, whereas a gray base will produce more muted shades. You may use cotton-linen or rayon-linen blends, but be prepared for potential uneven or inconsistent results. Before dyeing, create a hank of yarn by winding it around your hand and elbow, and secure it loosely with string. Next, prepare a soda ash solution by combining 1 cup (140 g) of soda ash with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of 105°F (41°C) water in a large jug. Shake to dissolve the soda ash and allow it to cool. Use pure soda ash (sodium carbonate) and avoid baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). If you have hard water, add a water softener to prevent minerals from interfering with the dye. Place your fabric or yarn in a plastic tub and add the soda ash solution to cover the material completely. Soak the linen for at least 20 minutes, then prepare the fabric reactive dye. Typically, you will need to mix 2 teaspoons of dye powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water; adjust the amount according to your desired shade and the instructions provided by the dye manufacturer. When handling the dye, protect your eyes, skin, and respiratory system by wearing safety goggles, rubber or plastic gloves, and a dusk mask approved for fine particles. Remove the linen from the soda ash solution, squeezing out any excess. Place the damp material on a plastic tray or bag and apply the dye using an applicator bottle or other technique. You can create a solid color or patterns with multiple colors, but be cautious of color mixing, as contrasting colors will form brown when they touch. After applying the dye, fold the linen carefully without causing colors to mix or touch. Place it in a zip or tie bag, keeping it in a warm location (minimum of 65°F or 18°C) for 12 to 24 hours. The longer it remains, the brighter and more vibrant the colors will be. Fiber reactive dyes are non-toxic and safe for the environment. Rinse the dyed linen until the water runs clear. It is recommended to use Synthrapol, which assists in setting the dye, but ensure all soda ash has been removed beforehand. Follow the instructions on the Synthrapol bottle, using hot water for rinsing. Finally, squeeze out most of the water from the linen and lay it flat on an old towel in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. Allow it to air dry completely before using the fabric or yarn. If dyed yarn is used, cut the strings holding the skein together and roll it into a ball after drying."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Her roommates dislike her, and she spends her time visiting Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), who is attracted to her, but very respectful. Although she does not appear to return his affection, she appears to be happier when with him. Lucy responds to an ad and is invited to meet Clara (Rachael Blake), who offers her a job: freelance silver service in lingerie. Lucy agrees, and Clara tells her that she will never be penetrated during these encounters. Clara and Thomas inspect her body. Clara says she will call Lucy by the name Sarah. Lucy gets beauty treatments before arriving for the event. She is the only girl dressed in white lingerie; the other women seem to be much older, wear severe makeup, and have black lingerie designed to reveal much more than to conceal. The event is a formal dinner party at an elegant home. Lucy serves drinks for the party and goes home with the money she made from it. After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets a call from Clara's assistant Thomas (Eden Falk) for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion, where Clara offers Lucy a new role with the clients, wherein she will drink some tea and then fall into a deep sleep.

Q:Article: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, \\"Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite to happiness. \\"Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy. In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery . For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,\\"People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people who were extremely dissatisfied. \\" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem. Which patient would see nearby objects clearer, patient A or pateint B? Answer:","completion":"Patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A. This is because patient A has hyperopia, a condition that causes nearby objects to appear blurry. In contrast, patient B does not have any eye issues, which means their vision is normal and they can see both distant and nearby objects with clarity. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, affects an individual's ability to focus on nearby objects. In a person with hyperopia, the light rays entering the eye are focused behind the retina, making close-up images blurry. This is a result of the eyeball being shorter than normal or the cornea being too flat. As these individuals can typically see distant objects clearly, their distance vision is not impacted by this condition. To correct hyperopia, convex lenses can be prescribed. These lenses bend the incoming light rays so that they focus properly on the retina, resulting in sharper vision of nearby objects. Convex lenses are thicker in the center and thinner at the outer edges. Depending on the severity of hyperopia, an individual may need glasses or contact lenses only for specific activities, such as reading or working on a computer, or they may need them for all tasks that involve near vision. On the other hand, patient B appears to have no eye issues. Their vision is considered normal, allowing them to focus on both nearby and distant objects with clarity. A person with normal vision, or emmetropia, has a well-proportioned eyeball and a cornea that refracts light correctly, producing a clear image on the retina. In conclusion, patient B, who does not have any eye issues, would see nearby objects clearer compared to patient A, who is affected by hyperopia and experiences blurry vision when focusing on close-up objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the digital age, a significant portion of news consumption takes place on websites and mobile applications. With the popularity of online and digital media, advertising has also adapted and shifted heavily towards web pages. Internet websites and news platforms are full of display ads, banners, sponsored content, and pop-ups. These advertisements blend seamlessly with the news articles and grab the readers' attention while they browse through the content. The main goal of these ads is to target relevant viewers and provide a more engaging and personalized experience. On the other hand, television, buses, and la ville (which means \\"the city\\" in French) do have advertisements, but they are unrelated to the act of reading news specifically. In these cases, the ads are more traditional and are usually not contextually related to the news that someone would be reading.

The rationale for choosing \\"drinking glass\\" as the answer is based on the following points: 1. Common usage: Drinking glasses are a standard and widely used method for consuming liquids. In most households and public places, drinking glasses are the primary vessels designed for this purpose. They are specifically intended for holding and consuming a variety of beverages efficiently. 2. Suitability for various liquids: Drinking glasses can accommodate various types of liquids, including water, soft drinks, juices, and even alcoholic beverages.

The wider opening at the top allows for easy sipping, and the transparent structure lets you see the contents and check the quantity remaining clearly. While the other choices like jar, cup, container, and tankard can also hold liquids, they may not be as specifically designed for drinking purposes or may not be as commonly used for consuming liquids as a drinking glass. For example, a jar or container usually serves a storage purpose, cups can be used for hot beverages, and tankards are typically associated with beer or ale.

See if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours. If she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it, chances are she’s interested in you. She may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks you're not looking. Of course, you don't want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy. Just glance in her direction, or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds. However, some girls are just shy, and they may not want to make eye contact with you. Try encouraging her with other steps. Smiling shows your interest, and makes it easy for her to smile back at you. Sometimes, it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before you’re ready to actually talk to each other. Even if you’re nervous, smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people. In other words, when you smile at her, her brain perceives it as a reward, making her happier to be around you. Don’t just hang around with the same group of friends. It’s much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone who's with a large group, so if you make sure you're alone sometime when she's around, she might come over and talk to you. You could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available. You never know what might happen. For instance, maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school. Make it a point to show up there, too. Try sitting at a table near her, where she can see you. ” It’s an easy first step and a way to acknowledge that you’re noticing each other. You don’t have to do much more at first if you’re shy. If she’s unwilling to say “hi” back, she might not be interested. Try it a few more times, but if she never responds, let it go. You might be nervous about approaching her, but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her. If she’s responded to your greeting, you can move ahead to actually talking to each other. Consider what you know about her, as that can lead to a conversation. Is she part of the drama club, or does she play sports? Engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation. You could even try to be funny, but that can be hard. You could ask, \\"Is your training on the track team really hard?\\" or \\"What did you think of the pep rally?\\" You could also say something like, \\"Wasn't the food gross in the cafeteria today? Isn't it awful what they call food?\\" or \\"Don’t you think Mr. Harrison looks and sounds a lot like Yoda?\\" Now that you have some possible questions, find a good time to talk to her. It should be a time when neither of you is hurrying off to class or activities, and hopefully when you’re both alone. It can feel really awkward the first time, but it does get easier. If she really responds and starts asking you questions too, chances are that she is interested in you. If she doesn’t really respond, it’s likely she’s not that into you. For example, if you asked whether her track training was hard, she might say, \\"Yes, but I love it!\\" In that case, you could say, \\"Cool! What do you love about it? I've always thought about getting into running, but it seems really hard.\\" Summary:","completion":"To see if she likes you, check if she makes eye contact and smiles at you. It's a good sign if she blushes or steals glances at you. Try to be alone sometimes, so she has a chance to approach you. Say \\"hi\\" as a simple way to connect. If she responds, start talking about things you know she's interested in. Ask questions and see if she asks you questions, too. This can help you figure out if she likes you.

Unlike the previous Omen films, the adult Damien is now entirely aware of his unholy lineage, and his destiny.An alignment of the stars in the Cassiopeia region of the night sky causes the generation of a 'superstar', described in the film as a second Star of Bethlehem. Thorn realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming of Christ and he orders all boys in England born on the morning of March 24, 1982 (the morning when, in the story, the Cassiopeia alignment occurred) to be killed in order to prevent the Christ-child's return to power.A subplot deals with one of Thorn's disciples, Harvey Dean, attempting to hide the fact that his own son was born at the appointed time; Dean not only fails at hiding that fact about his child from Damien, but is killed by his own hypnotized wife - likely in retaliation for refusing to go through with Damien's command to murder his son as a test of loyalty (the last child whom Damien suspects).Thorn has also become romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow), a complex relationship which undermines his plans for political dominion for the time being. But Damien is not deterred from his plans and even focuses his attention on her preadolescent son Peter (Barnaby Holm), whom he takes as a disciple, partly by manipulating and exploiting the boy's internal desire to have a father-figure.Meanwhile, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi) and six other priests armed with the seven daggers of Megiddo - ancient holy weapons which are the only Earthly weapons which can harm the Antichrist - hunt Thorn in the hope of killing him before he can destroy the Christ-child. However, one by one, Damien kills off all the priests (some in horrific circumstances) until only DeCarlo survives.Finally, in spite of Thorn's efforts, DeCarlo informs Reynolds that the Christ-child is out of his...

The body of pensioner Edith Gravener, who suffered from dementia, was found inside her home in St Helens, Merseyside, by her daughter-in-law last Tuesday. After officers were called, a search for her missing husband Ronald resulted in the 78-year-old's body being found in Carr Mill Dam, less than a mile from the couple's property, just hours later. Post mortem examinations showed that Mrs Gravener, a retired seamstress, died as a result of asphyxiation and Mr Gravener, a retired coal miner, of drowning. Edith Gravener, 79, was found dead at her home in Mallory Grove in the St Helens area of Merseyside (pictured), and her husband Ronald, 78, was found dead just a few hours later at a dam less than a mile away. Police confirmed that they believe Mr Gravener strangled his wife before committing suicide. A criminal investigation is now underway, with a file set to be prepared for the coroner. Stunned neighbours living in the sleepy cul-de-sac told of their shock after the bodies of the elderly couple were discovered just hours apart. One said: 'They had lived here for 20-plus years and were a really lovely couple. 'She suffered from dementia but he was totally devoted to her and cared for her around the clock. 'We used to see him going up the road to get his paper every morning. 'It's terrible what's happened. We've lived here for 30 years and nothing like this has ever happened around here before.' Another told how the first he knew of the tragedy was when police knocked on his door and told him that Mrs Gravener had been found dead and that Mr Gravener and his car had disappeared. He added: 'Whichever way you look at it, it's a tragedy.' Inquests into both deaths were opened on Monday afternoon. In the opening statements, it was revealed that Mrs Gravener's daughter-in-law, Amanda, had arrived at the house shortly after 9am on December 2 to take Mrs Gravener to see her GP, but had found the couple's property unlocked. Inside, she discovered Mrs Gravener's body and a note, penned by Mr Gravener, in which he allegedly apologised for his actions. A subsequent police search resulted in officers finding Mr Gravener's body in Carr Mill Dam shortly before 1pm. Police said an investigation into both deaths was 'ongoing' but detectives confirmed that they were not seeking anyone else in relation to either death.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm.

While discussing, Samuel learned that there are various types of computers, such as desktops, laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, gaming computers, and workstations. Samuel needed to determine which of these would make the best gift for Ryan. He considered factors like Ryan's preferences, usage requirements, and the computer's portability. One of Samuel's friends suggested that he could subtly inquire about Ryan's preferences and desires in a computer. So, Samuel initiated a conversation with Ryan, discussing casual topics like work, hobbies, and technology. He paid close attention to Ryan's opinions on various computer models and brands, hoping for some clues. Based on the conversation, Samuel now had a rough idea of what type of computer Ryan might appreciate. Ryan had mentioned a need for portability and expressed an interest in graphic design and gaming. With this information in hand, Samuel narrowed down his options and focused on high-performance laptops. Samuel took his research online and began reading reviews for various high-performance laptops on reputable websites, forums, and blogs. He compared specifications, prices, battery life, and display qualities to ensure that the laptop he chose would meet Ryan's multitasking and performance needs, as well as fit within his budget. Once Samuel had a list of potential laptops, he reached out to some of his tech-savvy friends again to help him finalize his decision.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Many people take it for granted that black is a color of bad things while white should always mean something good. This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Similarly, the British term for an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker. One does not have to cross an area to find color differences. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blue-blooded? If we go back to the origin, we find that both terms are logical as both names suggest. The expression \\"blueblood\\" comes from Spain, where some noble families proudly told the world that they had \\"blue blood\\". Actually they meant that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But then why \\"blue\\" blood? Because they were fair-skinned, and it is only natural that their blood vessels stood out appearing blue. Question: The best title for this reading selection is _ .

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm?, using the article: Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The..., what would be the answer ?

(CNN) -- What does it mean when a white sorority wins a competition that African-American fraternities and sororities not only created but also consider an essential part of their cultural expression? It means an uncomfortable discussion about race, history, culture and inclusivity that is not black and white. On February 20, the University of Arkansas chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha, a predominantly white sorority, won the inaugural Sprite Step Off stepping competition, beating two predominantly black sororities. Stepping, which began in the 1960s, is a intricate rhythmic dance that features synchronized foot stomps, handclaps, choreographed movements and chants. The competition was fierce, and all of the competitors fought hard for the 100,000 first-place scholarship. But this is the very reason why any African-American who dismissed the","completion":"win as mere tokenism or cultural appropriation should take a closer look at the cultural exchange at play. The victory of Zeta Tau Alpha in the Sprite Step Off, while initially contentious, represents an opportunity for an overdue conversation on shared spaces, cultural understanding, and the shifting boundaries of artistic expression. In the face of an increasingly globalized and interconnected society, this milestone exemplifies the growing importance of diverse and inclusive participation. This extends beyond simply race relations to include wider conversations about gender, sexual orientation, disability, and social class. It is worth reflecting on how any institution that seeks to enrich the lives of its participants should be receptive to all voices and talents, regardless of their origins. Engagement with various backgrounds and experiences can foster growth, collective learning, and shared perspectives among increasingly diverse communities. Historically, black fraternities and sororities have created and supported stepping as a vehicle for building unity, camaraderie, and cultural pride. The art form has been integral to the underpinning social and political structures of these communities, allowing members to engage with their own history and identity. Despite its association with traditionally African-American cultural spaces, the appeal of stepping lies in the energy, passion, and creativity of its participants. It speaks to something more universal – a celebration of expression, unity, and self-affirmation. While stepping is rooted in African-American history and culture, it is not necessarily exclusionary in nature. Creativity and expression, after all, are universal human impulses. By participating in stepping, the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority showed an appreciation for the cultural value and impact of the art form. By not only participating but also excelling in the competition, they demonstrated commitment, dedication, and respect for stepping as an artistic and cultural practice. Admittedly, there may have been initial surprise or skepticism about the participation and victory of a predominantly white sorority in a historically black art form. However, such reactions should not be allowed to overshadow the larger narrative – one of cultural exchange, mutual understanding, and goodwill. Instead, this moment should be seen as an opportunity to challenge preconceived notions, build bridges across cultural divides, and create shared spaces for growth and learning. With the ever-changing landscape of racial, cultural, and social dynamics in contemporary society, finding common ground and fostering understanding is more important than ever. The victory of the University of Arkansas chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha, while perhaps unexpected, sparked a dialogue on the inclusivity and diversity that animate stepping and similar forms of artistic expression. Through continued communication, shared experiences, and open-mindedness, this dialogue can facilitate more equitable, supportive, and empathetic communities. In conclusion, the issue of a white sorority winning a predominantly black stepping competition is not solely about race or cultural boundaries. It is about embracing opportunities for dialogue, understanding, and growth, allowing the driving principles of artistic expression and cultural pride to transcend social and racial divides. By doing so, we can work towards creating more inclusive, diverse, and harmonious spaces in our society."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals die on wetter soil happens, how will it affect sediments will not build on the top of the animals.

The wood frog has garnered attention by biologists over the last century because of its freeze tolerance, relatively great degree of terrestrialism (for a ranid), interesting habitat associations (peat bogs, vernal pools, uplands), and relatively long-range movements. The ecology and conservation of the wood frog has attracted research attention in recent years because they are often considered \\"obligate\\" breeders in ephemeral wetlands (sometimes called \\"vernal pools\\") that are themselves more imperiled than the species that breed in them. The wood frog has been proposed to be the official state amphibian of New York. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - The true frogs, family Ranidae, have the widest distribution of any frog family. They are abundant throughout most of the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The true frogs are present in North America, northern South America, Europe, Asia, Madagascar, Africa, and from the East Indies to New Guinea; the species native to Australiathe Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemelii\\")is restricted to the far north. - The Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemeli\\"), locally simply known as the wood frog, is the only species from the family Ranidae found in Australia. The species is restricted to the rainforest of northern Queensland, the eastern border of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, and much of New Guinea. Long placed in the \\"wastebin genus\\" \\"Rana\\", it is now in \\"Hylarana\\" together with such species as the common green frog of Southeast Asia. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The southern leopard frog ( Rana sphenocephala ) is a species of mostly aquatic true frog , found in the south - eastern third of the United States . There are two accepted subspecies . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.

Many times we find it hard to stay happy. When one problem is solved, another one comes up. People have money problems, work problems, family problems, health problems..... the list goes on. And we usually think that people who are happy and successful are having fewer problems than us. Look at the successful people we often mention. They have money they need, they have jobs they love, they have good friends, they have obedient kids, they have the successful business, they have loving families etc. Everything goes well with them. That is why they are happy and successful. But in fact, the more successful you are, the more problems you have to face. More success means more challenges they have to face, and more success means more risks they have to take. Young and old, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful, educated and uneducated, all have problems. The difference is that their problems are different from each other. Rich and successful have big problems. Poor and unsuccessful have small problems. Still they all have problems which they can face. Successful people are successful just because they are ready to face challenges larger than ordinary people. Winning the US elections makes Obama very happy. As a new US president, he has to face bigger challenges. He has to be more careful about his work he does, or he will lose his position . Looking at him, we may say he is lucky, happy and successful.

Summarize this article: For almost 40 years a bust has stood in Stockton-on-Tees in Country Durham commemorating match inventor John Walker. John Walker invented the friction match in 1826 and sold his first from his pharmacy in the town the following year. The inventor has been much celebrated by Stockton ever since and a celebratory bust was unveiled by the town's mayor in 1977. ||||| Walker did not patent his invention. Samuel Jones from London copied his idea and marketed his matches as \\"Lucifer's\\"!In 1826, John Walker, a chemist in Stockton on Tees, discovered through lucky accident that a stick coated with chemicals burst into flame when scraped across his hearth at home. He went on to invent the first friction match. Until the first half of the nineteenth century, the process by which fire was created was slow and laborious. Walker's friction match revolutionised the production, application and the portability of fire. Walker sold his first \\"Friction Light\\" on the 12th April 1827 from his pharmacy in Stockton on Tees. Walker's first friction matches were made of cardboard but he soon began to use wooden splints cut by hand. Later he packaged the matches in a cardboard box equipped with a piece of sandpaper for striking. He was advised to patent his matches but chose not to and, as a result, Samuel Jones of London copied his idea and launched his own \\"Lucifers\\" in 1829, an exact copy of Walkers \\"Friction Lights\\". Walker did not patent his invention. Samuel Jones from London copied his idea and marketed his matches as \\"Lucifer's\\"! |||||","completion":"The article talks about John Walker, who invented the friction match in 1826 and started selling it in Stockton-on-Tees from his pharmacy in 1827.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Mail lay scattered across the kitchen table. I couldn't put off sorting through it any longer. I checked the envelopes, putting aside the ones addressed to my husband. It had been over three years since Bob had died. To friends and family it looked like I had moved past the worst of my sorrow. I took care of my house, socialized and kept up with community. On the outside everything appeared to be normal. But inside I was anything but I worried I would never get better, never be myself again. They say sorrow has no set time limit, but I was so tired of feeling empty and hopeless. My sorrow was sharp and fresh as ever. It was like a wall of pressure in my chest, pressing my heart. I picked up a piece of Bob's mail and held it out to tear in half, but stopped myself from cutting up the envelope. The letter was from an organization that funded a Haitian orphanage called _ . Its founder, Carol Hawthorne, had given a presentation at our church. Bob and I had donated, and Bob ended up on the mailing list to receive the newsletter with updates on the children. I hadn't read one since Bob died. But just three months before, in January 2012, the country had been hit by a terrible earthquake. In my depressed state, it hadn't even occurred to me to wonder whether the orphanage had survived. I opened the newsletter and was surprised to find out that My Father's House was still standing. Of course now it was more crowded than ever. At the bottom of the page was an announcement about an upcoming trip to visit the orphanage in person. \\"I should go.\\" The thought wouldn't leave me.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the better film 's","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, \\"the better film's,\\" it's crucial to analyze the surrounding context and overall message of the complete statement. In isolation, the given phrase is not enough to accurately judge a positive or negative sentiment. However, going by the words' meanings, the term \\"better\\" generally has a positive connotation as it refers to something superior or of higher quality compared to another, while \\"film\\" is a neutral term referring to a movie or a recording on film. Considering these aspects, we can tentatively lean towards a positive sentiment. Nonetheless, without a full sentence or context, it is impossible to say with certainty whether the sentiment is definitively positive or negative. For instance, if the complete sentence were \\"The better film's message was uplifting and inspiring,\\" the sentiment would undoubtedly be positive. On the other hand, if it were \\"The better film's ending left me feeling depressed and disheartened,\\" then the sentiment would be negative. As a result, any sentiment analysis of the given phrase \\"the better film's\\" in isolation would be limited and not entirely accurate. It's essential to have more context or a complete sentence to confidently determine a positive or negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Macintosh: Although the PC market declined, Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks, although there were dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air. The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to \\"OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction\\". The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air.

Question: Background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Paragraph: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose joints will be more sore after skiing? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the paragraph about Margaret and her grandmother Kathy, it is likely that Kathy's joints will be more sore after skiing. This is because Kathy, being in late adulthood, is more susceptible to conditions such as arthritis and experiences a decline in strength and stamina. Additionally, individuals in late adulthood often face weakening immune systems and slower reflexes, which may contribute to a greater likelihood of experiencing soreness or discomfort after physical activities like skiing. While Margaret, as a sophomore in high school, is still young and likely in better overall physical condition, she can recover more quickly from physical exertion. Her muscles, joints, and immune system are stronger and more resilient, allowing her to better withstand the strains of skiing. Furthermore, Margaret's youth likely grants her better reflexes, strength, and stamina, all of which contribute to a reduced risk of joint soreness following physical activity. In conclusion, although both Margaret and Kathy may experience some degree of joint soreness after skiing, given the age-related factors and known risks associated with late adulthood, it is more probable that Kathy's joints will be more sore after their skiing adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge? from the following article ? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Summarize this article: See more of Lorene Bible on Facebook ||||| CHETOPA, Kan. — The latest search for a pair of missing Welch girls turned up empty. Cameras were used Friday to seach a well on property in Chetopa, Kansas, formerly owned by a convicted murderer in hopes of finding the remains of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman or a trace of anything that would help investigators solve the 16-year-old mystery. “The only thing we saw was a old bucket,” said Gary Stansell, an investigator for the district attorney’s office for Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties. Stansell said he continues to get leads on the case. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation classifies the girls’ 1999 disappearance as an ongoing investigation. The three-hour search of the well was initiated after Lorene Bible, Lauria’s mother, received a private message on a social networking site. “The person said come to the old Charlie Krider house and look in the well,” Bible said. Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared after the teens celebrated Ashley’s 16th birthday with a sleepover at the Freeman family home. In the early morning hours of Dec. 30, 1999, the Freemans’ mobile home in Welch went up in flames, and the charred remains of Ashley’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found inside. Both had sustained gunshot wounds that shattered their skulls, according to autopsy reports. The well, covered with a concrete slab, is around 10 miles north of the Freeman property on an empty lot about a block from the main thoroughfare in Chetopa. “There are still people scared of whoever did this,” Lorene Bible said. “The fear for them is still there.” The Chetopa land once was owned by Charles Christian Krider, 54. It was sold after Krider was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2004 death of Judith Schrum, who was strangled before her body was dumped in a Cherokee County creek, according to court documents. Krider is serving a 14-year sentence, and his earliest possible release date is April 13, 2017, records show. He was reported to be a close friend and co-worker of Danny Freeman and had several head of cattle on the Freeman farm, Stansell said. “We’re waiting on the next person who can tell to go look here or you need to go look here,” Lorene Bible said. “I need information that will lead to something good.” Bible said she receives about two or three tips a month that are serious. “The law enforcement has been wonderful — whether in Oklahoma or across the state line in Kansas,” she said. “I’ll go on and see what’s next.” ||||| Fifteen years ago Tuesday, Danny and Kathy Freeman were shot and killed and their mobile home set on fire. Their 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, and her best friend, Lauria Bible, were having a sleepover to celebrate Ashley’s birthday. The teens bodies were not discovered in the charred remains of the mobile home. Working on the premise that intruders kidnapped and possibly killed the teens, law officers began a frustrating, seemingly endless search that spanned the United States, Canada and Mexico. Today, law enforcement officers rattle off their names as one word. Lauria and Ashley. Their story has been profiled locally, statewide and nationally — and yet it remains unsolved. Jay and Lorene Bible, Lauria’s parents, are holding a memorial service Tuesday in Vinita, in hopes that publicity might help stir up memories in the case. “I still believe Lauria is alive,” Lorene Bible said. The Bibles want all the involved law enforcement agencies — the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the Craig County sheriff’s office, the Craig County district attorney’s office and the FBI — to sit down with them and release all the information and leads they have and work together to solve the case. Surviving members of the Freeman family had Ashley declared legally dead in 2010, according to court records. Meanwhile, investigators say that new leads have surfaced in the past months. Once such item involves two people, presumably men that got into an argument with Danny Freeman two weeks before the shooting deaths, said Gary Stansill, an investigator for the district attorney in Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties. “We learned that Danny told friends that two people came to the Freeman’s residence and there was a heated verbal exchange with one of the men,” Stansill said. Freeman knew one of the men and the other he knew by reputation, the investigator said. “We are not saying they are suspects,” Stansill said. “We just want to talk with them. If they have nothing to do with the missing girls or the killings, that’s OK — we just want to talk with them.” Stansill said he doesn’t know what the meeting was about. “That’s one of the questions we have,” he said. Danny Freeman reportedly had a hand in marijuana sales, family and friends have said in the past. “He (Freeman) did tell friends he had to run the men off and if they came back on his property he would run them off with a gun,” Stansill said. OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said the case is not closed as far as her agency is concerned. Brown said the agency recently received a tip, “and we will run it out to see if it has validity.” Brown said the state agency has investigated “hundreds” of leads and tips over the past 15 years. “Just because it is an old case doesn’t mean it can’t be solved,” Brown said. “We have solved 20- and 30-year-old cases in the past.” Solving the case depends on getting the right lead, she said. “Relationships can change between suspects,” Brown said. What happened? The Freeman’s property is located just outside of the Welch city limits and at that time was identifiable by the mailbox that sat on top of an iron-chain stand. A half-mile dirt driveway was marked with a rock entrance that led to the family home, which was slightly visible at night due to the few pole lights in the area. According to an autopsy report, a shotgun blast sheared off the bottom portion of Danny Freeman’s face and Kathy Freeman was shot in the back of the head and was found by investigators lying face down on the couple’s waterbed. Danny Freeman’s remains were found the next day near the waterbed by the Bibles, who were searching through the ashes. Danny Freeman’s extensive arrowhead collection was never found in the ruble. Lauria Bible’s car was still parked in front of the Freeman mobile home with the keys in the ignition. The teen’s purse, which contained money, was found in the charred remains of the mobile home. OSBI investigators also found a small arsenal of weapons as they searched through the debris of the house. Person of interest Jeremy Jones, 41, a convicted killer and rapist who once lived in Miami, OK, was a person of interest in the Freemans’ deaths. “I believe he knows something about the case,” Lorene Bible said. Arrest records show Jones was arrested on complaints of public drunkenness and possession of drug paraphernalia at 4 a.m. Dec. 30, 1999, roughly 18 miles from the Freeman’s farm.

Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \\"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. \\"When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,\\" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. \\"Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages.\\" \\"I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a...

On a scale of 0 to 5, where 5 would be an exact match, the user has asked for a 3. Step 2: Determine the key elements of the original sentence The original sentence includes these primary elements: an animal (dog), an action (laying), and an object (pet jacket). Step 3: Create a similar sentence To meet the '3 out of 5' similarity requirement, I need to create a sentence that keeps the primary elements (animal, action, object) but changes some aspect of these elements. Step 4: Justification of the proposed sentence \\"A puppy is resting in a pet coat.\\" This statement maintains the original elements: the animal (dog replaced with puppy), the action (laying replaced with resting), and the object (pet jacket replaced with pet coat). The changes are not too drastic but there's enough difference to warrant a similarity of around 3 out of 5.

Continue writing the following text. Prior to the 80\\"s theme party, Kenneth studied the clothing styles, while Nick went partying, so when at the theme party","completion":", Kenneth arrived feeling prepared and excited, dressed to impress in his carefully curated outfit. He had chosen a combination of some of the most iconic trends of the 80s, hoping to achieve an authentic and stylish look that would be a conversation starter. His outfit consisted of a vintage washed denim jacket covered in colorful patches, each one representing a different memorable aspect of the decade, such as famous movies, music artists and popular slang phrases. He wore a tight neon-colored graphic t-shirt depicting a well-known 80s band underneath. Kenneth also embraced the trend of high-waisted jeans, pairing them with a flashy white studded belt. Accessorizing his outfit was just as important to Kenneth, as he knew that the decade was defined by bold, statement-making fashion. He wore a pair of fingerless gloves, a bright colored bandana tied around his neck and his most prized possession, an original pair of white high-top sneakers that he had carefully restored to their former glory. To complete his look, Kenneth styled his hair in a wild, yet purposeful, manner which was inspired by musicians like Billy Idol and David Bowie. He opted for a voluminous messy-up texture, using plenty of hairspray to ensure his hair stayed put throughout the evening. Meanwhile, Nick, unaware of the details of an 80s theme and uninterested in preparing, decided to wing it. He threw on a pair of loose-fitting jeans, a plain t-shirt and had no distinctive hairstyle. He naively thought that his spontaneous party-animal attitude would be enough to impress the guests. As the two friends arrived at the 80's theme party, they were met with an array of vibrant and nostalgic decorations. The room was filled with neon streamers, disco balls and pop culture posters referencing popular movies, television shows and music icons of the era. The playlist was a carefully curated mix of the decade's most beloved and dance-worthy hits. As guests mingled and sipped on their period-appropriate cocktails, it quickly became apparent that Kenneth's extensive preparation and research had paid off. Not only did he look the part, but he was also well-versed in the decade's music, films, and slang, making him a popular addition to conversations throughout the evening. In contrast, Nick's lack of effort became evident as partygoers, one by one, expressed their disappointment about his seemingly uninspired appearance. Despite his usually outgoing nature, Nick found it difficult to connect with other guests, who were deeply engaged in discussions about their favorite 80s memories, trivia, and references. As the night wore on, Kenneth and Nick's experiences at the theme party became vastly different. Kenneth found himself immersed in a world he had grown to love – dancing to classic hits, singing karaoke with newfound friends, and taking part in 80s-themed games and contests. He even won the \\"Best Dressed\\" award, which boosted his confidence and love for the decade. On the other hand, Nick couldn't help but feel out of place and slightly regretful about his lack of preparation. He quickly realized that not taking the time to appreciate and understand the 80s had hindered his experience and ability to connect with others at the party. Their contrasting experiences at the 80s theme party served as a valuable lesson for the pair. Kenneth's dedication to understanding and embracing the decade's culture showed just how much impact one's effort and preparedness could have on their experiences and their ability to connect with others. For Nick, it highlighted the importance of respecting the themes of such events and not relying solely on his charismatic personality to carry him through the evening. In the end, both Kenneth and Nick walked away from the 80s-themed party having gained valuable insights into the power of preparation, understanding, and authenticity – concepts that, while initially inspired by the vibrant, wild and eclectic world of the 1980s, could be applied to many aspects of their lives moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. In 1930-31, against the first West Indian side to visit Australia, Bradman's scoring was more sedate than in England--although he did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne. However, he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against the South Africans in the Australian summer of 1931-32. For NSW against the tourists, he made 30, 135 and 219. In the Test matches, he scored 226 (277 minutes), 112 (155 minutes), 2 and 167 (183 minutes); his 299 not out in the Fourth Test, at Adelaide, set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia. Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series. At this point, Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227 runs at an average of 131. He had played 18 innings, scoring 10 centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200. His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour, with 856 (or 38.5% of his tally) scored in boundaries. Significantly, he had not hit a six, which typified Bradman's attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a \\"machine-like\\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as, \\"heart-breaking ... with his sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the Sphinx ... he never seems to perspire\\". Between these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired. Bradman's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life. The church \\"was under siege all throughout the day ... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view\\"; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat. Just weeks later, Bradman joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada. He travelled with his wife, and the couple treated the trip as a honeymoon. Playing 51 games in 75 days, Bradman scored 3,779 runs at 102.1, with 18 centuries. Although the standard of play was not high, the effects of the amount of cricket Bradman had played in the three previous years, together with the strains of his celebrity status, began to show on his return home.","completion":"This text is about Sir Donald George Bradman, an Australian international cricketer who is often referred to as \\"The Don\\" and widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.ppsspp.ppsspp. Answer:","completion":"Title: Extremely Disappointing, Full of Issues - Was Expecting More As an avid gamer and someone who really appreciated the idea of having a PlayStation Portable emulator on my phone, I couldn't wait to try the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I struggle to find any redeeming qualities in this app. Hence, I am left with no choice but to give it a 1-star review. First of all, the app's compatibility with various game titles is severely lacking. I tried to run multiple games from different genres and with different file formats, only to find that more than half of them wouldn't even launch. Those that did launch were either plagued with unbearable lag or failed to work at a crucial point during gameplay. For an app that is designed specifically for the purpose of playing PSP games on mobile devices, such poor compatibility is simply unacceptable. The user interface is another major letdown. It is not intuitive at all, and navigating through the app feels like traversing a maze. There are too many options and confusing settings that make the entire configuration process a tiresome chore, even for someone with technical knowledge. The absence of a proper tutorial or guide only exacerbates this issue for first-time users who are left to figure everything out by themselves. When it comes to performance, the app severely under-delivers. I experienced frequent crashes at random intervals, which only added to my frustration. Moreover, the app seemed to drain my phone's battery at an astonishingly fast rate, rendering it practically unusable for extended periods of time. Besides that, even on the lowest settings, the app heats up my device to an alarming degree, which is worrisome as it could potentially cause permanent damage to my phone. Another frustrating aspect of the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is the inconsistency in its updates. Whenever the developers release a new version, it seems to introduce a new set of glitches and bugs that make the gaming experience even more disappointing. Instead of making any significant improvements, every update seems to take the app one step back. Lastly, the customer support is virtually nonexistent. I reached out to the developers on multiple occasions to report issues, ask for guidance, or inquire about potential fixes to the existing problems, but have yet to receive any response. This lack of support further highlights the app's inadequacies and showcases the developers' lack of commitment to their users. All in all, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is a massive disappointment and falls short on numerous fronts. Between its poor compatibility, counter-intuitive interface, dismal performance, unreliable updates, and nonexistent support, the app is hardly worth anybody's time or effort. It is incredibly unfortunate to see such an amazing concept so poorly executed. Until the developers seriously address these issues and deliver significant improvements, I would strongly advise users to look for better alternatives in the market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's important to take these feelings seriously. Now, let me explain it in a more simple way: 1) Dealing with a person with suicidal thoughts because of a relationship: Imagine a friend is feeling really, really sad because they had a big fight with someone they love. They might feel like they don't want to be alive anymore. Your job is to be a good listener and remind them that they are not alone and that they should talk to a grown-up who knows how to help them feel better. 2) Best ways to deal with suicidal thoughts: Let's say you are the one feeling very sad and you don't know what to do. You should tell someone you trust, like a parent or teacher, so they can help you. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when we don't feel well. 3) Are these questions the same? While both questions are about helping people who feel very sad, they are not exactly the same. One question is about helping a friend, while the other question is about helping yourself.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Astana ( , ; Kazakh: Astana ] ) is the capital city of Kazakhstan. It is located on the banks of Ishim River in the north portion of Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administrated separately from the region as a city with special status. The 2017 census reported a population of 1,006,574 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in Kazakhstan, behind Almaty. Can we infer the following? The combined population of the two largest cities in Kazakhstan is over two million.","completion":"To infer the combined population of the two largest cities in Kazakhstan, we need to analyze the information given and follow these steps: 1. Identify the population of Astana: The text states that Astana has a population of 1,006,574 as per the 2017 census. 2. Identify that Almaty is the largest city in Kazakhstan, which means it has a higher population than Astana. Now, let's infer the combined population of Astana and Almaty: Since Astana has a population of 1,006,574, and Almaty's population is higher than Astana's, we can safely assume that their combined population would be greater than twice the population of Astana (2 x 1,006,574 = 2,013,148).

In fact, the context states the opposite. Here is the evidence from the given context that supports the use of computer-generated animation in the making of Roving Mars: 1. \\"The film uses few actual photographs from Mars\\": This phrase indicates that the filmmakers did not solely rely on actual photographs taken during the Mars Exploration Rovers' mission. This suggests that some other method or technology was used to depict the rovers and their experiences on Mars. 2. \\"opting to use computer generated animation based on the photographs and data from the rovers and other Mars probes\\": This sentence explicitly states that the filmmakers chose to use computer-generated animation in the creation of Roving Mars. This choice was made to enhance the viewer's experience by generating animations based on the real photographs and data collected by the Mars rovers and probes. 3. \\"The film has been released on Blu-ray disc by distributor Disney\\": This statement does not directly relate to the use of computer-generated animation in the making of the documentary. However, Disney, as a distributor, is known for its expertise in animation and visual effects. This connection could further strengthen the notion that computer-generated animation was utilized during the production of Roving Mars. Based on these points from the context, it is clear that computer-generated animation was used in the making of Roving Mars. This directly contradicts the suggested hypothesis, and as a result, we cannot draw the hypothesis that computer-generated animation was not used in the making of this film."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: Retinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is common in eye disorders. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) are reported to initiate sterile inflammatory response. The role of PRRs in retinal IR injury is currently unknown. Thus, we investigated the expression and function of membrane and cytoplasmic PRRs during retinal IR.', 'Retinal IR was induced in adult Brown Norway rats by clipping the retinal vessels for 30 minutes. RNA and proteins were extracted during the course of reperfusion, and the expression levels of the following proteins were determined: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with pyrin domain protein 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18. TLR4 expression in the retina was studied using immunohistochemistry. In addition, a TLR4 inhibitor was injected into the vitreous body as a therapeutic agent. After the treatment of TLR4 inhibitors, the levels of the above factors were evaluated, the apoptosis of cells in the retina, expression of cleaved-caspase-3 (c-casp-3), death of retinal ganglion cells, and the retina electroretinography was assessed.', 'After releasing the artery clamp, the retinal vessels were reperfused in 5 minutes. During the reperfusion, TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, NF-κB, NLRP1, NLRP3, mature IL-1β, and IL-18 were upregulated, but not TLR2. In the IR model, TLR4 was highly expressed in ganglion cell and glia cell. Additionally, the inhibition of TLR4 significantly downregulated the activation of NLRP3, but not NLRP1, and the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18 also were inhibited. Moreover, the TLR4 inhibitor partially attenuated the injury of the retina, including alleviated retina apoptosis, downregulated c-casp-3 expression, rescued retinal ganglion cells death, and restored retina function.Question: Is retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes?

(CNN)There has been a new twist in the curious case of leading golfer Robert Allenby who last month reported being beaten and kidnapped in Hawaii. Hawaii Police have confirmed they have arrested a 32-year-old man on charges of identity theft, attempted theft and unauthorized possession of confidential personal information. But in a press conference, Lieutenant John McCarthy told reporters there was no evidence of a kidnapping or a physical altercation. \\"Honolulu police booked a 32-year-old male this afternoon for three counts of second-degree identity theft, three counts of second-degree attempted theft, and one count of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information,\\" the police statement read. \\"The suspect was arrested at the Oahu Community Correctional Center where he was being held on a contempt warrant for an unrelated incident. The male has five previous convictions, including one felony drug conviction. \\"Investigators identified numerous unauthorized charges made on Mr. Allenby's credit cards. The charges were made at various retail and convenience stores on Oahu. \\"No additional suspects are being sought, and this case has been turned over to the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney.\\" Channel Seven in Australia reported that Allenby told them his initial version of events may not have been accurate because he had concussion and was drugged. Australian Allenby did not respond when contacted by CNN. The police also said there was no credible evidence the golfer had visited a strip club, as was reported by several media outlets. Allenby, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, was in Hawaii for the Sony Open and after missing the cut went out for dinner on Friday 16 January with his caddie Mick Middlemo and another friend. Soon after the incident the 43-year-old said in an interview with the Golf Channel that as he left the wine bar he was approached by a group of men who then attacked him. \\"Somebody hit me and I woke up on the streets in the gutter. I'd been thrown out of the trunk of a car and I'd been robbed,\\" said Allenby, who was pictured sporting cuts on his nose and forehead in the interview. \\"It was scary, you just never know. You see it in the moves -- I've seen Taken and Taken 2 and it's kind of like a spitting image,\\" he added, referring to the 2008 French thriller that starred Liam Neeson. But a woman who witnessed the incident later told Australian network Nine News that she found Allenby a block from the wine bar and not 10 kilometers away as he had suggested. \\"Two homeless people were kicking me -- I don't know if they were just trying to see if I was alive. But they were trying to take stuff off me, but all I had on me was my clothes,\\" Allenby explained. \\"I started running down the street away from them once I'd pulled myself together, and this lady was helping me, she was fantastic.\\" Asked about the golfer's claims he was beaten, Lieutenant McCarthy said: \\"I don't know what physical altercation you are talking about. \\"There is no kidnapping investigation going on. I don't want to get into the details but his (Allenby's) story with us has been very consistent.\\" Allenby released a statement through the PGA Tour on Thursday. \\"I want to thank the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) for their ongoing work in this investigation,\\" he said. \\"As I have continually said, these detectives are the best at what they do and I was always confident they would discover what happened. \\"I continue to fully cooperate with the HPD and I look forward to this matter being fully resolved. \\"I also want to thank the many people who have expressed their support and concern for me in the last month.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Hawaii police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the case of golfer Robert Allenby, who reported being beaten and kidnapped in Hawaii last month.

Please answer a question about the following article about Namibia: South Africa occupied the colony in 1915 after defeating the German force during World War I and administered it from 1919 onward as a League of Nations mandate territory. Although the South African government desired to incorporate 'South-West Africa' into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de facto 'fifth province', with the white minority having representation in the whites-only Parliament of South Africa, as well as electing their own local administration the SWA Legislative Assembly. The South African government also appointed the SWA administrator, who had extensive powers. Following the League's replacement by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement, requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration (along with a definite independence schedule). The Herero Chief's Council submitted a number of petitions to the UN calling for it to grant Namibia independence during the 1950s. During the 1960s, when European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia. In 1966 the International Court of Justice dismissed a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa's continued presence in the territory, but the U.N. General Assembly subsequently revoked South Africa's mandate, while in 1971 the International Court of Justice issued an \\"advisory opinion\\" declaring South Africa's continued administration to be illegal.

They tour a luxurious, four-story brownstone and are shown, among other things, the master bedroom which houses an interesting commodity: a panic room. Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), the realtor, explains that the previous owner was a reclusive millionaire who built the hidden panic room as a safeguard against intruders. It's protected with four-inch walls and an impressive security system built in complete with a separate phone line and security cameras situated throughout the townhouse. However, despite Sarah's intrigue, Meg is apprehensive about the room. Still, pressured by the tight market and assured that the home will quickly close, Meg decides to move in right away. After some light unpacking and a pizza dinner, they settle in for the night. Meg checks her daughter's watch, designed to track her blood sugar and keep her type 1 diabetes in check, before retreating to her room to bathe and down a bottle of red wine, clearly distraught over the move and her recent divorce.

Residents were told they had 14 days to respond to legal notice. Hampshire County Council has apologised for the 'breathtaking error' Article:","completion":"Title: A Case of Bureaucratic Bungling: Misdirected Legal Notices Shock Stubbington Residents In a recent turn of events that put a peaceful village in the eye of a potential bureaucratic storm, Hampshire County Council made a salient blunder, in inadvertently mailing legal notices to nearly 150 residents in the quaint village of Stubbington. This miscalculation, stemming from within the bureaucratic machinery, led to unanticipated confusion and concern amongst the ordinarily tranquil lives of the villagers, resulting in the council issuing an immediate formal apology for the gaffe. This delivery mistake was of no trivial nature, as the letters made recipients believe they had just 14 days to respond to the assumed legal notice. A fortnight—terribly short a span—to comply with what seemed like abrupt and unexpected legal obligations was understandably a source of shock and consternation for the peaceful residents of Stubbington. The repercussions of such an error sent reverberations across the quiet village, with an understandable air of concern and worry permeating across households and neighbourhood gatherings. Residents wondered if they had inadvertently run afoul of the law or if they had unintentionally overlooked a civic responsibility. Once the error was flagged, Hampshire County Council swiftly owned up to the mistake, referring to it as a 'breathtaking error' in their public apology. The council exhibited immediate transparency in an attempt to quell the unease. The council's public statement read, \\"We unequivocally apologise for this breathtaking error. We are conducting a rigorous internal investigation to determine how this could have occurred and to prevent any recurrence in the future. We understand the distress that this may have caused our residents and we assure them that the letters were sent in error. There is no action required on their part.” The council's swift response and promise to look into the matter did bring a level of respite to the shaken residents, assuaging their apprehensions about their purported legal responsibilities. The swift and unequivocal apology from the council helped bring a scent of normality back to the rustling leaves of Stubbington. However, the incident has brought to light the need for the implementation of a more robust system in place to prevent such mishaps from recurring. On the one hand, any oversight can lead to unnecessary distress to the recipients, and on the other hand, breaches of this nature can potentially damage the council's credibility, leading to a chink in their otherwise sturdy shield of public trust. In looking ahead, it is vital for Hampshire County Council to address two main aspects in the aftermath of this incident. First, a thorough analysis and improvement of their internal processes to minimise such bungling in the future. And second, to continuously reassure and communicate with the residents, thereby renewing their faith in the council's capacity to manage their affairs effectively and efficiently. In conclusion, the quiet village of Stubbington experienced an unusual period of uncertainty and concern due to the 'breathtaking error' by Hampshire County Council. However, the experience served as a stark reminder for all public service entities about the importance of precision, accuracy, transparency and accountability in their operations, and the impact that a lack of these can have on the communities they serve."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 7, equation weights = [0, 8]","completion":"Part #1: Understand polynomial equations. Usage: In the polynomial equation 2x^2 + 3x + 4, the weights are 2, 3, and 4. It meets the criteria because the weights are the numbers multiplying the variable x or its powers in the equation. Part #2: Represent polynomial equations with weights. Usage: The equation weights [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4, and [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. This meets the criteria because the given weights list corresponds to the coefficients in the polynomial equation. Part #3: Substitute a given value of x in a given polynomial equation. Usage: Substitute x=7 in the equation represented by weights [0, 8], which is 0x^1 + 8 (or simpler, 8). This meets the criteria as the given value of x is used as a substitute in the equation. Part #4: Compute the result of the polynomial equation after substitution. Usage: After substituting x=7 in the equation 0x^1 + 8, the result is 0*(7) + 8 = 0 + 8 = 8.

And the answer is...","completion":"Alright, let's solve the problem step by step, remembering we're talking to a 5-year-old: 1. We have 61 oranges (o) and 19 more oranges (o). How many oranges do we have in total? That's right! 61 + 19 = 80 oranges (o). 2. Now we know there are 80 oranges on one side. On the other side, we have a box that can hold 106 oranges (o), but it's currently empty, so it has -106 oranges (o) inside. 3. Our problem now looks like this: 80*o + 186 = -106*o 4. To solve for the number of oranges (o), we need to get all the oranges on one side. Let's move the -106 oranges (o) to the other side with the 80 oranges (o). 5. When we move the -106 oranges (o), it becomes positive, so we add it to the 80 oranges (o). What do we get? Yes! 80 + 106 = 186 oranges (o). 6. Our problem now looks like this: 186*o + 186 = 0 7. To find the number of oranges (o), we need to get rid of the 186 we added earlier. So let's subtract 186 from both sides. 8. This gives us: 186*o = -186 9. Finally, to find out how many oranges (o) we have, we need to divide the -186 by 186. What do we get? That's right! -186 ÷ 186 = -1 So, the answer is: o = -1 That means there is one less orange than we expected, or we could say there's a missing orange."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: Who causes a distraction, allowing Han, Sean, and Neela to flee? Twinkie The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Develop the main characters and their relationships Our main characters are Han, Sean, and Neela. All three are street racers who form a bond over their shared experiences and love for fast cars. Han is an experienced racer, Sean is a newcomer looking to make a name for himself, and Neela is a fiercely independent woman who is trying to escape her past. Twinkie is their quirky and resourceful friend who provides comic relief and support to the group. Step 2: Introduce conflict and set the story's main goal The story begins with Han, Sean, and Neela embroiled in the cutthroat world of street racing, where they make powerful enemies. They become targets of a dangerous criminal organization led by the ruthless kingpin, Racer X, who wants to control the entire city's underground racing scene. The team's main goal is to bring down Racer X and his organization, while evading the authorities and Racer X's henchmen. Step 3: Create the build-up to the climax As the story unfolds, Han, Sean, and Neela score several wins against Racer X's organization, successfully disrupting his operations and gaining a reputation in the street racing community. Their targets are now painted even larger on their backs, as both the authorities and Racer X's henchmen are closing in on them. Step 4: Establish the scene for the answer to the given question In a tense scene where the main characters' backs are against the wall, they find themselves cornered at a big street racing event. Racer X's henchmen and the police surround the area, making it nearly impossible for Han, Sean, and Neela to escape. Step 5: Introduce Twinkie's involvement in the climax Now, let's answer the given question: Who causes a distraction, allowing Han, Sean, and Neela to flee? Twinkie. In realizing the grave danger their friends are in, Twinkie steps up to the plate and creates an ingenious distraction. Twinkie remotely hacks the race event's sound and lighting system, causing chaos and confusion amongst Racer X's henchmen and the police. Simultaneously, Twinkie compromises the engines of the henchmen's and police cars, rendering them temporarily unusable. Step 6: Show the escape and resolution Taking advantage of the distraction caused by Twinkie, Han, Sean, and Neela quickly make their escape amidst the chaos. They hop into their fast cars and speed away together to a safe location. The group ultimately dismantles Racer X's organization and frees the city's underground racing scene from his control. Step 7: Conclude the story In the end, our heroes have managed to evade their pursuers and stay one step ahead of danger, forging a stronger bond. They continue racing and making sure the streets stay free from criminals like Racer X. The story concludes with Twinkie receiving well-deserved praise and respect from Han, Sean, and Neela for their heroic intervention. In conclusion, the movie plot revolves around the intense world of underground street racing, where Twinkie's quick thinking and resourcefulness allow their friends, Han, Sean, and Neela, to escape from their powerful enemies and achieve their goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Los Angeles Lakers rolled over the Indiana Pacers in Wednesday's the opening round game of the NBA championship series. Hypothesis: The Los Angeles Lakers will win the NBA championship series this year.","completion":"From the context provided, we can only draw a limited perspective on the hypothesis that the Los Angeles Lakers will win the NBA championship series this year. While the information presented suggests that the Lakers had a strong performance against the Indiana Pacers in Wednesday's opening round game, it doesn't necessarily guarantee that they would win the entire championship series. There are several factors to consider in building a more thorough understanding of the hypothesis: 1. Strength and form of other competing teams: The NBA championship series involves multiple teams competing at various stages of the playoffs and the finals. The overall performance of the Lakers would depend not only on their success against the Pacers but also how they fare against other strong contenders in the series. 2. Key players' performance and health: The performance of any team in a professional sports league depends largely on the form and health of its key players. It is important to know the injury status of the Lakers' star players, as well as how they are performing throughout the season. 3. Consistency in performance: A single opening round victory doesn't necessarily indicate a championship-winning team. The Lakers need to maintain consistent performances over the course of the entire championship series. Some teams may excel in the early stages, but then falter as the competition progresses. 4. Coaching and team strategies: A team's success also depends on their coaching staff's ability to devise effective strategies and tactics that can exploit the opposition's weaknesses. Information about the Lakers coaching staff's success in this area would contribute to the hypothesis. 5. Historical performance in the championship series: While past performance doesn't always guarantee future success, it's worth considering the Lakers' track record in NBA championship series. Is the team known for multiple NBA championships, or do they tend to struggle in the latter stages of the competition? In conclusion, while the Los Angeles Lakers' victory over the Indiana Pacers in the opening round game of the NBA championship series is a positive indicator, it is not enough to confidently claim that they will win this year's championship series. Further analysis and consideration of a multitude of factors, including team performance, player health, coaching strategies, and historical context, are essential for drawing a more informed and robust hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What do Emma and Dean learn together on a deserted island? Movie title: The Blue Lagoon Movie plot: In the Victorian period, Emmeline Foster and Michael Reynolds, two British children, are the survivors of a shipwreck in the South Pacific. After days afloat, they are marooned on a lush tropical island in the company of kindly old sailor Paddy Button. Eventually, Paddy dies in a drunken binge, leaving Emmeline and Michael all alone with each other. Together, they survive solely on their resourcefulness, and the bounty of their remote paradise. Years pass and both Emmeline and Michael become tanned, athletic and nubile young adults. Eventually, their relationship, more along the lines of brother and sister in their youth, blossoms into love, and then passion. Emmeline and Michael have their baby boy, and they live together as common-law husband and wife, content in their solitude. But their marriage is threatened by the arrival of two evil traders, who force the child to dive for pearls at gunpoint, before killing each other off. Emmeline is reminded of the outside world and wants to leave the island. She fears for the child if she and Michael should die, and begins to think of his future. Michael finally succumbs to her pleading and they pack a small boat and leave the island. But becalmed in the middle of the ocean, they succumb to exposure. They are found by a British ship, but the film leaves their fate ambiguous.

Background: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251-183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \\"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\\". Context: A revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \\"Pretty Little Picture\\" and \\"That'll Show Him\\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \\"Echo Song\\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \\"Farewell\\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \\"Echo Song\\" and \\"Farewell\\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden. The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical. Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance. In addition, Jason Alexander, who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in Jerome Robbins' Broadway, also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. Question: Did it win any awards Answer:","completion":"Yes, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum won several awards, particularly for the actors who portrayed the role of Pseudolus on Broadway. The 1972 revival starring Phil Silvers as Pseudolus won two Tony Awards: Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium. The 1996 revival, which opened at the St. James Theatre, was also successful in terms of awards and nominations. Nathan Lane, who starred as Pseudolus, won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical as well as the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical. The production itself was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Revival of a Musical. It is noteworthy that every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance.

Given the below context: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to... Guess a valid title for it!

For older models, check out buyer's guides from Mac Rumors and similar sites. If you're new to Macs, visit a physical Apple Store for personal assistance. Just don't be tempted to buy on the spot — there are better deals. Apple tends to release new computer models every six months or less. If the current model has been around a few months, wait for an update. The \\"old\\" model will drop in price. Current or incoming college students get a major discount, as do faculty and staff at any school. Visit the online education store to get the cheaper price. After you choose a product and enter payment info, Apple will send you to another site to verify your status for free. You'll need proof of your educational status (typically a student or staff ID). If you do not have this, call or visit an Apple Store for advice. Look for summer back to school deals. Apple usually throws in a free 100 gift card to the App Store.

Still, why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive.

An eight-grade student's father was angry after his son received an assignment with a cartoon depicting political views on immigration policy. Scott Radies of Wisconsin said his 13-year-old son, Jarrett, received the homework for social studies class at Shattuck Middle School with an illustration of two bricklayers - one each to represent a Republican and a Democrat, while the bricks symbolized a 'pathway to citizenship'.

The assignment was intended to encourage critical thinking and observational skills, and it was not meant to sway the students' political affiliacies, the spokesperson added. \\"We encourage students to think critically about a wide variety of views and appreciate the diverse perspectives that shape our world,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"This exercise was part of that broader effort to develop well-rounded, informed citizens who can evaluate complex information and form their own opinions.\\" However, Scott Radies argued the cartoon was inherently biased and created a divisive narrative in the classroom. He believes the assignment unfairly pits Republicans against Democrats in an unfavorable light regarding their views on immigration policy. Radies said that his son felt uncomfortable and thought the assignment put him in a tough spot where his own views were at odds with the political cartoon. Scott Radies shared the incident on social media and his posts garnered significant attention, with many people expressing concerns about the potential indoctrination of children with politically skewed views in schools. An online petition was started calling for more balanced representation of political viewpoints in educational coursework, which has been signed by over a thousand individuals. In response, the school district affirmed their commitment to presenting balanced views on all topics discussed in school. They stated they are reviewing the appropriateness of the material used in this particular assignment. \\"We need to make sure we're providing our students with a fair and balanced approach to complex issues like immigration policy,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"We’ll be meeting with educators and parents to discuss the situation and see what adjustments need to be made moving forward.\\" They also noted that they are planning a series of community dialogues to discuss such issues with parents and students, hoping to strike a balance while educating youngsters about prevailing social and political issues in the country. On top of that, they will be providing additional training for teachers regarding the sensitivity of these types of assignments, with an aim to better equip them in handling political issues in the classroom in a balanced, thoughtful and inclusive manner that respects the diverse political beliefs of their students and their families. Scott Radies stated that he wants the school to admit that the cartoon assignment was a mistake, and to assure that no other student will face such a situation in the future where they might feel their political beliefs are challenged. His hope is for a discussion where everyone’s views – including those of the students and their parents – are heard and respected. In conclusion, while the school district maintains that the assignment was intended to stimulate critical thinking and not to propagate a particular political bias, they recognize the need to review the material used to ensure no inadvertent propagation of a political bias, and aim to foster a better dialogue among their community. This incident has underlined the delicate balance that schools must maintain while teaching potentially contentious topics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The proposed £19 billion EuroVegas casino resort, which is planned to be built on the outskirts of Madrid, has stirred controversy among various sectors of Spanish society, despite the potential massive inward investment and job creation it promises. With a design covering an area approximately the size of 750 football pitches, the extensive complex is expected to include 12 hotels, six casinos, a convention center, three golf courses, theaters, shopping centers, bars, and restaurants. Furthermore, it is projected that the development process will span 18 years and create 260,000 jobs, providing a significant boost to the local economy during a time when Spain is grappling with a substantial deficit and an unemployment rate of 26 percent. However, not everyone in Spain welcomes the idea of such an ambitious project. There are several concerns and reasons as to why the EuroVegas plan faces rejection in various sectors of Spanish society. 1. Moral and ethical concerns: Some groups and individuals argue that the construction of EuroVegas could lead to an increase in negative social factors, including gambling addiction, prostitution, and organized crime. There is a fear that the resort will facilitate an uncontrolled proliferation of such issues, negatively affecting both residents and tourists alike. 2. Environmental concerns: The size and scale of the EuroVegas project have raised concerns regarding its environmental impact. Issues such as excessive water and energy consumption, waste generation, and habitat destruction have been mentioned as potential problems that could result from the project's development. 3. Cultural impact: Some Spanish citizens believe that EuroVegas could result in the loss of national identity and cultural heritage. They fear that the resort will contribute to an Americanization of their local culture by introducing a foreign business model that may overshadow traditional Spanish values and customs. 4. Economic concerns: Critics argue that the EuroVegas project could destabilize the local economy by shifting resources and focus away from more sustainable industries and towards an industry based largely on gambling tourism. There is also a concern that the employment opportunities offered will consist predominantly of low-quality, insecure jobs. 5. Political concerns: Some sectors of Spanish society fear that the development of EuroVegas could negatively influence the country's legal and regulatory framework, potentially leading to political corruption and the erosion of democratic processes. In conclusion, although the proposed EuroVegas casino resort project comes with the promise of economic rejuvenation through significant inward investment and job creation for Spain, a large portion of Spanish society remains wary of the potential moral, ethical, environmental, cultural, economic, and political consequences. This rejection signals that many believe the costs may outweigh the benefits in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In his tent on the beach, Zurga notes that the storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (\\"L'orage est calmé\\"). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (\\"Je suis jaloux\\"). Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace. Outside the temple, Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn and the coming double execution (\\"Dès que le soleil\\"). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals that he is the man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return (\\"Plus de crainte...Rêves d'amour, adieu!\\"). (In the revised version of the ending introduced after the opera's 1886 revival, Nourabad witnesses Zurga's freeing of the prisoners and denounces him to the fishermen, one of whom stabs Zurga to death as the last notes sound of Leila and Nadir's farewell song.

The shockwaves of this event have deeply distressed the community, including Bulger's mother Denise Fergus, who expressed her condolences to Bradley's family. Background James Bulger, a two-year old British boy, was killed by two ten-year-old boys in a horrendous and notorious crime in 1993. The highly-publicized case left a permanent scar on the nation's conscience and ever since, the public has remained highly sensitive to those connected or involved in any capacity to the case. Scott Bradley's Ordeal Scott Bradley, a 36-year-old man unrelated to the Bulger case, was tragically found dead at his residence on Sunday. For months, he had been relentlessly targeted over false rumors that he was one of the child killers. Unfortunately, the constant harassment and emotional distress seem to have taken a toll on him, ultimately resulting in his untimely death. Denise Fergus' Reaction Upon learning of Mr. Bradley's death, James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, expressed her shock and sadness regarding the situation. In a heartfelt statement, she said, \\"I am shocked and upset to hear of Mr. Bradley's death. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family during this extremely difficult time.\\" Fergus empathized with the pain of losing a loved one and called for respect and support for Bradley's family. A Call to End Unfounded Rumors This incident serves as a stark reminder of the severity of the consequences that can result from false accusations and the drawing of erroneous connections. The loss of Scott Bradley, an innocent man, should be a wake-up call for the public to refrain from spreading baseless rumors and to act more responsibly in the age of social media. Conclusion As the community continues to grapple with the sad news of Scott Bradley's death, we must take this opportunity to condemn false assumptions and urge everyone to think before they speak. We extend our sincerest condolences to Mr. Bradley's family and friends and hope that we can all learn from this tragedy in order to prevent similar events in the future."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

News article: What is Cupping Therapy Used at Olympics by Michael Phelps This week everyone’s talking about cupping, a therapy that some Olympic athletes competing in Rio have been partaking of. It caught people’s attention this week because the therapy often leaves round marks that look like bruises on the skin, but it’s certainly not new. The practice has been used in ancient Chinese medicine for thousands of years as a way to treat pain, muscle stiffness and even respiratory issues. Perhaps one of the most notable athletes to sport the signature cupping marks is Michael Phelps. Other athletes, including swimmer Natalie Coughlin have also embraced the practice, as you can see below. “That’s been the secret that I have had through this year that keeps me healthy,” said American gymnast Alexander Naddour, USA Today reports. “It’s been better than any money I’ve spent on anything else.” So how does cupping work? Either heat or air is used to create a suction in special cups that are placed on the body. The vacuum that’s created pulls the skin and blood vessels in toward the cup, which is why they can leave marks on the skin. Cupping is thought to pull blood to a certain area, and improve circulation and loosen up muscles and joints. There’s also some suggestion that it has anti-inflammatory effects. In the U.S. it is sometimes used in addition to acupuncture or massage. A specialist can apply the cups, though as USA Today reports, some athletes say they are doing it themselves. There is a difference between how cupping is practiced in traditional Chinese medicine and how it is used in Western medicine, says Dr. Brent Bauer, director of the Mayo Clinic Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program. Bauer says a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner would likely offer cupping as part of a larger integrative health check, which might include recommendations around nutrition and other health things, and not just as a one-off therapy. “It’s kind of an American phenomena, I think, to consider cupping by itself,” he says. In traditional Chinese medicine, the theory is that cupping can influence the flow of energy or “qi” through the body, says Bauer. If someone’s flow is blocked or stagnant, a practitioner might use cupping to impact the flow. Western practitioners may focus more on what the therapy might be doing to muscles or blood flow. Some question whether there’s enough clinical evidence to say cupping is definitely effective—though it has been studied. A 2010 review of 550 clinical studies, including 73 randomized controlled trials—which are considered the gold-standard study in the science community— concluded that the “majority of studies show potential benefit on pain conditions, herpes zoster and other diseases.” None of the studies reported serious bad health outcomes from the practice. Another 2014 review of 16 studies with 921 people reported short-term pain reduction from cupping. “I think you have to step back and say, if this has been part of an organized medical system for three thousand to five thousand years, we probably shouldn’t be too quick or too arrogant to dismiss it out of hand as Western scientists sometimes do,” says Bauer. “On the other hand, just because something has been around for that long doesn’t mean we should embrace it willy nilly.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Despite being used for thousands of years, questions remain about the clinical efficacy of cupping therapy, though some studies have shown potential benefits for pain conditions and other diseases. 4. Cupping is practiced differently in traditional Chinese medicine compared to Western medicine, with the former considering it as part of an integrative health approach while the latter tends to focus on its physical effects on muscles or blood flow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to oil a baking tray, the best method is to sprinkle about a tablespoon of cooking oil onto the pan and let the oil distribute evenly across the surface. This allows for better coverage and prevents any areas from being dry or left uncoated.

This is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents. However, if you aren't yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one. That's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots. But, despite this, it's still a good film and kept my interest. A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life. However, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her?! Well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved. I DIDN'T like how they handled the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd.

The reviewer mentions that it's a better than average silent movie worth seeing for fans of the genre but suggests newcomers try a few other films first.

Given the question: What do you see for entertainment on a screen? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. movie B. casino C. theatre D. show E. comedy The answer is:","completion":"A. Movie A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. Movies are an ideal source of entertainment on a screen, as they are specifically designed to be displayed on screens, whether it be in a cinema, on a television, or a personal device such as a tablet or computer. Movies come in a variety of genres, such as action, drama, romance, comedy, science fiction, animation, and documentaries, which cater to the diverse interests and tastes of the audience. The process of film production, from scriptwriting to post-production editing, often involves numerous creative professionals who come together to turn ideas into compelling stories on screen. High-quality visuals, acting performances, musical scores, and sound design work together to deliver an immersive and enjoyable viewing experience. Cinemas, or movie theaters, offer an enhanced viewing experience with large screens and professional sound systems, allowing the audience to fully engage with the film. Additionally, watching movies at home through digital streaming services, satellite or cable channels, or DVD and Blu-ray players has become a popular form of entertainment, with audiences having access to an extensive library of films. While the other options, such as casino (B), theatre (C), show (D), and comedy (E) may provide some form of entertainment, they do not necessarily focus on screen-based experiences. For instance, casinos primarily involve gambling, and theatre focuses on live performances, such as plays or musicals. Shows and comedies can be a part of movies, television, or theatre, but they represent specific genres, whereas movies encapsulate a broader range of screen-based entertainment. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question, \\"What do you see for entertainment on a screen?\\" is A. Movie, given its diverse genres, immersive viewing experience, and the fact that movies are explicitly created to be displayed on screens across various platforms, making it an ideal option for on-screen entertainment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next question: when did it become legal to advertise prescription drugs on tv?","completion":"The history of advertising prescription drugs on television can be traced back to the United States in the 1980s. However, it was not until August 1997 that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidelines which effectively made Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs on television legal. Before the 1980s, there were limitations on how pharmaceutical companies could promote their products. The FDA traditionally confined prescription drug promotion to medical journals and professional audiences, including physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. This was done to ensure a greater level of control and responsibility in advertising, while also aiming to prevent misinformation on medications being communicated to the general public. As the media landscape evolved and the potential reach of television commercials grew, pharmaceutical companies sought new opportunities to market their products directly to consumers. Initially, in the 1980s, some prescription drug advertisements did gradually appear on TV, but they were discrete and heavily focused on brand promotion. These advertisements often avoided mentioning therapeutic claims or specific benefits. In 1997, the FDA released draft guidance that set forth specific requirements and limitations applicable to DTC advertising of prescription drugs on television. These guidelines revolutionized drug advertising by allowing pharmaceutical companies to market their prescription drugs directly to consumers, in addition to healthcare professionals. The 1997 FDA guidelines mandated that DTC advertisements for prescription drugs must include a \\"major statement\\" that discloses the most important risk information associated with the drug, as well as a \\"brief summary\\" detailing all risks. Additionally, if the TV advertisement makes any effectiveness claims, it must present both the drug’s benefits and risks in a balanced and fair manner. To ensure consumer access to detailed information, these advertisements must also provide sources where consumers can obtain the FDA-approved prescribing information, such as toll-free telephone numbers, referencing print ads, or website addresses. Following the FDA's updated guidelines, DTC advertising of prescription drugs on television increased significantly. The United States remains one of the few countries, alongside New Zealand, where prescription drug advertising directly to consumers is legal on television. It is important to note that the practice of advertising prescription drugs on television remains a controversial topic. Supporters argue that it raises consumer awareness of available treatments and encourages patients to seek help for medical conditions. Critics, on the other hand, believe that consumer-directed advertising can lead to overprescription of medications and undermine the decision-making authority of healthcare professionals. As a result, discussions concerning prescription drug advertising on television continue to occur in both legal and public health spheres."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

BRIAN WILLIAMS, anchor: We begin with what may be the largest confrontation of its kind since the Korean War . Tonight South Korea is threatening enormous retaliation after an attack by North Korea , in a dangerous part of the world, where the chance of a nuclear confrontation already runs high on a good day. The first attack happened while most Americans were sleeping. It was after midnight Eastern time . The North fired a barrage of artillery at an island controlled by South Korea . Two soldiers were killed. After the volleys that followed, there were reports of dozens of homes and buildings on fire. President Obama has had morning and evening briefings. Here's a photograph of tonight's meeting in the situation room. Tensions remain high, with the South threatening a counterattack. We want to begin our reporting here tonight with our chief foreign affairs correspondent, Andrea Mitchell . Andrea , good evening. ANDREA MITCHELL reporting: Good evening, Brian . This was basically an act of war. Arguably North Korea 's worst attack on civilian targets since the Korean War . The big question tonight, why did Pyongyang do it, and how will South Korea respond? The crisis began routinely. Eight PM Monday night, Eastern time , South Korea is engaging in a military drill after notifying the North . Midnight Eastern , four hours later, North Korea starts firing dozens of rounds of artillery onto a highly-populated South Korean island, killing two South Korean marines, injuring dozens more, including civilians. For more than an hour, North Korea unleashes a barrage of artillery, about 80 shells. South Korea scrambles F-16 fighter jets and returns fire almost immediately. 3:55 AM , President Obama is awakened by the national security adviser, Tom Donilon . 4:33 AM , the White House issues a written statement saying, \\" The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action.\\" 9:15, the Oval Office , Donilon and director of national intelligence , General James Clapper , brief the president. The US decides not to respond or escalate, urging South Korea to show restraint. In Seoul , South Korea 's President Lee Myung -bak meets with his generals and threatens \\"an enormous retaliation\\" if the North attacks again. In fact, this is the second attack from the North in eight months. In March, Pyongyang sank a South Korean ship, killing 46 sailors. Is all this a show of strength as North Korea 's ailing leader, Kim Jong Il , prepares to turn over power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un ? Mr. KENNETH LIEBERTHAL (Asia Expert): The younger Kim is being encouraged to show that he can be strong, that he's a tough guy. And so this is probably not the last such provocation we're going to see. And these are really acts of war. MITCHELL: Special US envoy Stephen Bosworth , already in Beijing , pressed China today to get Pyongyang to stop its aggression. Mr. STEPHEN BOSWORTH: We strongly believe that a multilateral diplomatic approach is the only way to realistically resolve these problems. MITCHELL: China , along with the US, signed the armistice in 1953 that ended the Korean War , and is obligated to help police the cease-fire. But China has been reluctant, reports NBC Beijing bureau chief Adrienne Mong . ADRIENNE MONG reporting: China is unlikely to do America 's bidding, but this latest situation puts Beijing in a delicate position. As an ally of North Korea , it has considerable influence. But China is also concerned about regional stability and afraid of being overrun by refugees should North Korea collapse. MITCHELL: In recent days, North Korea also shocked the US by revealing that, despite tough sanctions, it has built a sophisticated uranium enrichment plant potentially capable of producing powerful atomic bombs. The Stanford nuclear expert who saw that plant briefed Secretary of State Clinton today. Tonight the president is calling South Korea 's president and the US officials here are hoping for a united front at the United Nations , even though that has not stopped North Korea before. Brian: We're watching this one very closely. Andrea Mitchell , part of WILLIAMS: ||||| SEOUL—North Korea fired artillery at a South Korean island near a disputed western maritime border Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines in a surprise barrage that kindled global worries about worsening relations between the countries. In the wake of North Korea's attack on a South Korean island, John Bussey looks at how the incident differs from past skirmishes and what role China might play to lower tensions between the two countries. Plus, making art out of beef fat. Victor Cha, Director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University, talks to Simon Constable about the implications of today's artillery rocket attack by North Korea on a South Korean island and whether it will lead to a full-scale war. A South Korean military unit on the island returned fire, while South Korean military officials scrambled fighter jets. At least 16 marines were injured, military officials said. Three civilians were injured, and the island's 1,200 residents were sent scrambling for bomb shelters. \\"The whole neighborhood is on fire,\\" said, Na Young-ok, a resident of the island, called Yeonpyeong, from a bomb shelter about an hour after the shelling began. South Korean officials condemned North Korea and warned that it would respond in kind to further provocations, while South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened an emergency meeting of defense and security agencies. \\"The attack is a sheer act of provocation. Moreover, shooting indiscriminately on civilians cannot be forgiven,\\" said Hong Sang-pyo, spokesman for Mr. Lee. \\"Our military reacted immediately according to our combat rules. We will act sternly against any more provocation. North Korea should take the responsibility for this.\\" North Korea's official media late Tuesday said South Korea's military fired artillery into water on the North's side of the maritime border while conducting a drill, and that in response it fired the artillery at Yeonpyeong. A South Korean presidential spokeswoman said officials were exploring whether there was a link between the shelling and North Korea's earlier complaints about a large-scale exercise the South's military started this week. North Korea has complained in the past about exercises without retaliation, however, and the South's large-scale exercise wasn't taking place near the island. A History of Korean Tensions A detailed timeline of the recent skirmishes between North and South Korea. View Interactive The U.S. and European Union condemned the shelling, while Russia and China called for a cooling of tensions on the peninsula. Japan's government went on high alert, with Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordering cabinet members to step up information gathering and prepare for emergencies. \\"The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability,\\" the White House press secretary said in a statement, referring to South Korea by its formal name. The White House said President Barack Obama plans to call South Korean President Lee Myung-bak to discuss the attack. The U.S. will stand \\"shoulder-to-shoulder\\" with South Korea over the incident, said White House Press Secretary Bill Burton . Mr. Burton called the attack \\"outrageous\\" and said the U.S. wants to send its condolences to South Korea. Mr. Burton said the U.S. will work with global leaders in the coming days to figure how to best deal with North Korea's attack. Col. David Lapan, the Pentagon spokesman, said that no additional U.S. military assets had been moved to the region, nor were any discussions of immediately holding military exercises planned. Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, called on the \\"North Korean authorities to refrain from any action that risks further escalation and to fully respect the Korean Armistice Agreement.\\" A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China, North Korea's main benefactor, called for peace and stability. \\"We hope all involved parties will do more to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula,\\" Hong Lei said during a regular news conference. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the attack and conveyed his concerns to the Security Council's president, saying the attack was \\"one of the gravest incidents since the end of the Korean War.\\" British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, whose country holds the council presidency, said he is in discussions with other council members and the secretary-general and that a council meeting is likely to be held Wednesday. The incident comes after relations soured dramatically between the two Koreas over the past two years, as North Korea's totalitarian regime became angered at South Korea's decision to cut off economic assistance unless it ends its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The issue of North Korean nuclear weapons intensified over the weekend after the revelation that Pyongyang had already installed thousands of centrifuges to produce nuclear fuel at its Yongbyon nuclear facility The exchange of fire also comes less than two months after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il began a process of transferring power to his son Kim Jong Eun, a process that analysts have said is likely to be volatile as the younger Kim grapples for authority over the North's military. The incident roiled financial markets in Asia, briefly sending the U.S. dollar sharply higher before it gave back some gains, on a flight from what are considered riskier investment. The Bank of Korea convened an emergency meeting to discuss potential effects. Several financial analysts quickly issued reports that said they didn't expect South Korea's stock market to be heavily affected. The episode adds to a list of more than 30 fatal or life-threatening attacks by the North against the South—including plane bombings, assassinations and naval skirmishes—since the two countries fought the Korean War in the 1950s. Most recently, a South Korean warship sank in March about 40 miles west of the island struck Tuesday. South Korea blamed North Korea for the sinking, citing an exploded torpedo it found and other evidence. South Korea Under Attack View Slideshow Associated Press A train-station TV screen in Seoul shows smoke pouring from Yeonpyeong island Tuesday. A spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said \\"scores of rounds\\" were fired by the North. The artillery was fired from positions south of the North Korean city of Haeju. Video captured by closed-circuit monitoring cameras on location showed people scrambling out of buildings as explosions rocked the island. The artillery fire came without warning at 2:34 p.m local time and lasted for 65 minutes, military officials said. About 250 residents escaped the island in fishing boats and arrived in the port city of Incheon two hours later. As the sun set three hours after the attack, fires continued burning in numerous homes and buildings and smoke covered the island, according to people there and on a nearby island called So-yeonpyeong. The incident shocked South Koreans, who have become accustomed through the years to brash statements and other provocations by North Korea. \\"If this leads to any other provocation, it really will be disturbing in many ways,\\" Song Young-min, an insurance consultant and military reservist, as he watched the news on his cellphone in downtown Seoul. Lee Eui-sup, who works at South Korea's National Pension Service, said he immediately suspected instability inside the North's leadership due to the succession process prompted the firing. \\"It is a serious problem but will soon disappear as it usually does, I believe,\\" Mr. Lee said. From the island of So-yeonpyeong, residents watched as the rockets hit the larger Yeonpyeong island. Some sent photos and cellphone videos of the attack to South Korean TV stations. \\"When I heard the artillery, I thought it was a usual military exercise, but then I noticed the fire and smoke,\\" said Lee Seung-yeon, a resident on the smaller island. What Happened When 2:34 p.m.—North Korea attacks Yeonpyeong island near disputed maritime border. South Korea returns fire \\"immediately,\\" the defense ministry said. A military alert for battle situations is issued. 3:28 p.m.—Local media report four South Korean marines seriously wounded by the North's artillery fire 3:40 p.m.—South Korean fighter jets are deployed to western sea border to counter the attack. 3:57 p.m.—President Lee Myung-bak convenes an emergency meeting of ministers. 5:19 p.m.—Meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning with South Korea's Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong-yong and other officials from the Knowledge Ministry, Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea. 6 p.m.—President Lee's office issues a statement on the attack, calling it \\"clear military provocation\\" and warning of \\"stern\\" action if the North makes further military moves. Bank of Korea officials plan to hold an emergency meeting in Seoul to discuss monetary and financial market issues. 6:35 p.m.—The White House \\"strongly condemns\\" the attack. 7:11 p.m.—North Korea says it will continue to launch strikes if the South violates the maritime border. Source: Dow Jones Newswires The two Yeonpyeong islands are the easternmost of five small islands that are within close firing range of North Korea. All are just a few kilometers away from the maritime border known in South Korea as the Northern Limit Line, or NLL, that was drawn up by the United Nations after the end of the Korean War in 1953. The North has objected to the line since the early 1970s, arguing in part that the line forces its ships to take lengthy detours to international shipping lanes. Its objections intensified in the 1990s and led to two deadly skirmishes in the area in 1999 and 2002. In 2007, leaders of the two Koreas agreed to turn the area into a \\"peace zone.\\" That vaguely worded agreement was struck just ahead of a South Korean election by an outgoing government and never implemented. It was interpreted in North Korea as erasing the maritime border and in the South as keeping it. —Joe Lauria, Jieun Shin, In-soo Nam, Aaron Back and Megumi Fujikawa contributed to this article.

Question: what is vitamin a for A:","completion":"Yes, the statement regarding beta-cryptoxanthin having vitamin activity in humans is correct. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays several essential roles in maintaining good health. There are two primary forms of vitamin A: preformed vitamin A (retinol) and provitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. Here are some of the primary functions of vitamin A: 1. Vision: Vitamin A is essential for maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions. It supports the normal functioning of the retina, cornea, and other ocular tissues. 2. Immune System: Vitamin A is required for the proper functioning of the immune system, as it helps regulate the activities of various immune cells and supports the integrity of the mucosal barriers. 3. Growth and development: Vitamin A is vital for the growth of tissues and cellular differentiation, playing a crucial role in the development of organs and the maintenance of epithelial tissues, such as the skin and the linings of the eyes, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts. 4. Reproduction: Vitamin A plays a role in the development and maturation of sperm cells in males and the normal growth of the placenta in pregnant females. 5. Antioxidant activity: Some vitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, have antioxidant properties, which can help protect the body against free radical-induced oxidative damage. In summary, vitamin A is essential for various physiological functions, including maintaining healthy vision, supporting immune function, facilitating growth and development, and playing a role in reproduction. Beta-cryptoxanthin, a provitamin A carotenoid, contributes to these functions by providing some vitamin A activity in humans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart. The Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. The Appalachians ( Figure below ) are now on a passive margin. The mighty mountains have weathered and eroded to what they are today. Q: How many millions of years ago did pangaea begin breaking apart? A: A:","completion":"Pangaea began breaking apart approximately 250 million years ago. This massive supercontinent, which once encompassed all of the Earth's landmasses, started to disintegrate due to the movement of tectonic plates and the formation of divergent plate boundaries within the continents. These plate boundaries caused the continents to rift apart and initiated the continental drift that continues to this day. The ongoing process of plate tectonics is responsible for the current configuration of continents and the geological features we observe today. For instance, the Pacific Ocean is gradually shrinking, while the Atlantic Ocean is expanding. This change is due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which continue to shape our planet's surface. The Appalachian Mountains, situated in eastern North America, have also been significantly affected by these geological processes. These once mighty mountain ranges are now situated on a passive margin, meaning that they are no longer an active area of tectonic activity. As a result, the Appalachians have been subjected to extensive weathering and erosion, which has led to their current appearance. In summary, Pangaea began breaking apart approximately 250 million years ago. This fragmentation was caused by the formation of divergent plate boundaries within the continents and the subsequent continental drift. The ongoing movement of tectonic plates continues to shape the Earth's surface, resulting in the current arrangement of continents, the growth of the Atlantic Ocean, the shrinking of the Pacific Ocean, and the evolution of geological features such as the Appalachian Mountains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A British jihadi bride has taken to Twitter to warn her 'sisters' back in the UK against contacting married men in Syria and to get their own militant husbands. Aqsa Mahmood, a 'bedroom radical' who travelled to Syria earlier this year, advised women thinking of joining extremists in the Middle East 'not to be a home wrecker' in a series of Twitter posts this week. Writing under an alias, the 20-year-old invited 'sisters' to use encrypted messaging services to make contact with those waging jihad abroad, but urged them not to ask questions 'already answered' in extremist blogs. Scroll down for video. Aqsa Mahmood, a British jihadi bride who travelled to Syria earlier this year, has been tweeting advice for 'sisters' in the UK. Posting for the first time since threatening the West on the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, she wrote: ‘Sisters please for the sake of Allah contact the sisters whom [sic] are online. 'Also know the fact many brothers whom you contact and chat to are married. Have some self respect and don't be a homewrecker.' The messages come after a string of threats against the West were detailed in an online diary by the former student. As well as warning against contacting the husbands of female extremists, she told would-be militants to 'pack thermal clothing' if they intend to travel to Syria, where the winters are 'too much'. 'Bun (forget) Scotland, the winters here are too much. Sisters please don't forget to pack thermal clothing or you'll regret it later on,' she wrote. She also hinted at her whereabouts, making reference to the Syrian town of Manbij, north east of Aleppo. The 20-year-old posted a series of tweets from a Twitter account offering other female jihadists advice. The former student also referred to a horse in the Syrian town of Manbij and tweeted this photograph. Today a spokesman for the 20-year-old's family said the posts were 'torturing' her parents. 'The family are aware of recent tweets. The best advice they could offer Aqsa is to not to offer any advice to young Muslims to whom she is essentially offering a death sentence,' Aemar Anwar, the family's lawyer, said. 'It's an extremely painful (situation) of mixed emotions - of extreme anger that their daughter has shamed them and shamed the community of Scotland. 'She has joined a cult that murders and tortures innocents. Yet again she's out there tweeting, attempting to take other children from their families. 'It's extremely difficult for her parents, not knowing whether she's dead or alive, wondering whether she will ever return home safely and added to that is the anger and shame at what she continues to do. 'What she claims to do in the name of Islam doesn't match with any of the values they taught her. A spokesman for the girl's parents Muzaffar and Khalida Mahmood said Aqsa's continued messages is 'torturing' the couple who are trying 'to move on with their lives' 'It's daily torture for them worrying about her yet having to get on with their lives. They have three other children to think about. 'She's gone now, but there's still this constant drip from Aqsa.' Mr Anwar added while her parents would still welcome the youngster back to the UK, the window of opportunity for her safe return is narrowing. 'She'll either be killed there by a drone or another militia. Or she can come home. 'We publically stated that every case should be treated on a case by case basis, and it may well be the situation that the authorities will want to speak to her. 'But if she was to face criminal sanctions it would be much better than what is likely a death sentence in Syria. Mahmood has not been seen by her family since fleeing their Glasgow home last November. In February, the former private schoolgirl married an extremist and began chronicling her life in the Middle East in a series of blog and Twitter posts. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'Enquiries are continuing into this matter.'

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the world's longest type of venomous snake????","completion":"The world's longest venomous snake is the King Cobra, scientifically known as Ophiophagus Hannah. Its name \\"Ophiophagus\\" is derived from Greek, bits of which translate to \\"snake-eating,\\" which is reflective of its dietary habits. This species highly prefers to feed on other snakes, and occasionally, it can eat lizards or rodents. The King Cobra is native to the rainforests and plains of India, Southern China, and Southeast Asia. Notably observed in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia amongst other countries, they often occupy dense highland forests. King Cobras are quite impressive in size. On average, they typically measure between 10 to 13 feet (3-4 meters) in length, and can reach weights from 6 to 20 lbs (3-9 kgs). However, the longest known specimen in captivity, named \\"Crunch,\\" a resident at the Crystal Palace Aquarium in England, measured 5.85 meters, or approximately 19.2 feet. In the wild, the largest accurately measured King Cobra was 5.59 meters or 18.3 feet in length. The King Cobra's venom is a potent cocktail of neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, and other compounds which can cause paralysis and death in its prey. When threatened or cornered, this species is known to raise up to a third of its body off the ground, flatten its neck ribs into a 'hood', and growl menacingly. Despite their intimidating demeanor and potent venom, they tend to avoid humans and typically only attack when cornered or when a female's eggs are threatened. Despite being the longest venomous snake, it's worth mentioning, they are not the most venomous. That title goes to the Inland Taipan, a snake native to Australia whose venom is far more toxic compared to King Cobra. Irrespective of the toxicity, an untreated King Cobra bite is very deadly to humans. Unfortunately, King Cobras are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Deforestation, loss of habitat, and value on the black market have all contributed to a decrease in King Cobra population. Some countries such as India have deemed this majestic creature as a protected species. In cultural aspects, particularly in India, the King Cobra has significant roles in local myths and is also a staple in various snake charmer performances. Additionally, the King Cobra is recognized in the logo for the famous car manufacturer, Shelby, indicating speed, power and grace. In conclusion, the King Cobra is the world's longest type of venomous snake, fascinating and often terrifying due to its great size, venom potency, and striking appearance. Their ecological role is invaluable as they help control populations of other snakes, thereby keeping the ecosystem balanced."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you need to answer 'Yes' if the given word is the longest word (in terms of number of letters) in the given sentence, else answer 'No'.

There are several elements in the premise that indicate the falsity of the hypothesis: 1. \\"A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in\\": This phrase clearly highlights that there was at least one child who applied but was not accepted. The father's disappointment reflects that not every child was accepted into the program. 2. \\"Only VIP brats had been accepted\\": The father's statement implies that there may have been a bias in the selection process, favoring children from privileged backgrounds or with influential connections. This suggests that not every applicant was given equal opportunity or consideration. 3. \\"Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC\\": The fact that Furtok's child got into the program, and the reaction he had to the father's statement (hitting the father in the face), indicates that the acceptance process might not have been entirely fair and transparent. This further supports the idea that not every child that applied was accepted. 4. The fact that the statement about VIP brats being accepted led to a physical altercation signifies that the environment was not one filled with delight, as the hypothesis states. Instead, it presents a picture of tension and dissatisfaction. In summary, the hypothesis \\"Every child that applied got accepted, to everyone's delight\\" cannot be considered true based on the given premise. The text presents a situation in which not all applicants were accepted, and the reaction of the disappointed father, along with the conflict between two parents, clearly demonstrates that not everyone involved was delighted with the outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Greece's response was a decisive \\"No\\" (or \\"Oxi\\" in Greek). This is remembered and celebrated annually in Greece as \\"Oxi Day\\".

This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Input: Question: What is the term for the process in which two atomic nuclei fuse together to make a single nucleus? Answer: fusion Output:","completion":"Fusion is a nuclear reaction where two atomic nuclei combine to create a single, more massive nucleus. The supporting facts for this process are: 1. Energy release: During fusion, a significant amount of energy is released due to the conversion of a small portion of the mass of the reactant nuclei into energy, according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc². This energy release is mainly in the form of kinetic energy and radiation. 2. High temperatures and pressures: The conditions required for fusion to occur include extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees Celsius) and pressures. These conditions allow the atomic nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between their positively charged protons and get close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together. 3. Occurrence in stars: Fusion is the primary process responsible for energy production in stars, like our Sun. In stars, hydrogen nuclei (protons) merge to form helium nuclei through a series of fusion reactions called the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle. These fusion reactions produce energy in the form of light and heat, which is emitted from the star's surface. 4. Fusion isotopes: The most common and well-studied fusion reaction on Earth involves the isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium (D) and tritium (T). When deuterium and tritium nuclei fuse, they create a helium nucleus, a free neutron, and release a substantial amount of energy. This is known as D-T fusion. 5. Fusion power: Scientists and engineers have long been exploring ways to harness the energy produced by fusion reactions for power generation on Earth. Fusion power has the potential to provide a nearly limitless, clean and sustainable source of energy. Experimental devices such as tokamaks and stellarators have been developed to contain and control fusion reactions using magnetic fields. In summary, fusion is the process where two atomic nuclei combine to create a single, heavier nucleus. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy and occurs in extreme conditions typically found in stars. Harnessing fusion reactions for energy production on Earth remains an ongoing and promising area of research."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given a context paragraph, a question based on that and corresponding answer of a question.

Problem: maxwell leaves his home and walks toward brad ' s house at the same time that brad leaves his home and runs toward maxwell ' s house . if the distance between their homes is 70 kilometers , maxwell ' s walking speed is 4 km / h , and brad ' s running speed is 6 km / h , what is the distance traveled by brad ? Output:","completion":"We can solve this problem by determining how long it takes for Maxwell and Brad to meet, then use this time to find how far Brad travels. Step 1: Since both of them are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds. This will be 4 km/h (Maxwell's speed) + 6 km/h (Brad's speed) = 10 km/h. Step 2: Next, we need to find out how long it takes for them to meet each other. Because they are moving towards each other, we divide the total distance by their relative speed. Therefore, the time it takes them to meet is 70 km (the total distance) divided by 10 km/h = 7 hours. Step 3: Brad's travel distance will be his speed multiplied by the time it took for them to meet. So Brad travels 6 km/h (his speed) * 7 hours = 42 kilometers. Therefore, the distance traveled by Brad is 42 kilometers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Scriptures of the religion Buddhism were written in various languages, which language would likely be read by the landlocked country of Mongolia?\\" Context: \\"Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on learning the various texts. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. Buddhist scriptures are mainly written in Pāli, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese. Some texts still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The landlocked country of Mongolia would most likely read Buddhist scriptures in the Mongolian language. As mentioned in the context, Buddhist scriptures and texts exist in various languages, primarily Pāli, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese. Some texts still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. The preference for the language of the scriptures often depends on the region and the specific schools of Buddhism practiced there. Mongolia has a rich history of Buddhism, primarily associated with Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. However, since the 13th century, Mongolian translations of Tibetan Buddhist texts have been produced, and the process has continued throughout the centuries. These texts cover various aspects of Buddhism, including philosophy, rituals, and meditation practices. The Mongolian language and script were initially developed under the influence of the Uyghur script, incorporating some elements of Tibetan, Chinese, and other regional scripts. In Mongolia, due to the historical connection with Tibet and the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan Buddhist canon - composed of the Kangyur (translated words of the Buddha) and the Tengyur (commentaries by Indian and Tibetan masters) - has been particularly influential. When the process of translating Tibetan Buddhist texts into the Mongolian language began, it adapted to the needs and cultural context of the region. As a result, many Mongolian translations of Tibetan Buddhist texts exist today, reflecting the importance of Buddhism in the history and culture of Mongolia. These translated texts also contain unique features and adaptations that make them distinctly Mongolian, preserving the cultural heritage of the country. Therefore, considering the deep-rooted history of Buddhism in Mongolia, the strong influence of Tibetan Buddhism, and the availability of Buddhist texts translated into the Mongolian language, it is most likely that Buddhists in Mongolia would read scriptures in the Mongolian language. Doing so not only allows them to engage in religious practices more readily but also preserves the nation's rich linguistic and cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Research by the Institute of Education (IOE) in London found that men who went to single-sex schools were not only more likely to be separated from a partner or divorced, but also more likely to be depressed by middle age. The chances of women having successful marriages were not affected by whether they were educated in mixed or single-sex schools.Separate research by the IOE found that going without boys was beneficial for women in other ways since there was a \\" statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women\\". The study into marital success interviewed 17,000 adults who were taught in a range of schools including private boarding schools to state comprehensives.It found that single-sex education does not compromise the chances either of men or women of getting married. However, researchers found that boys educated on their own were more likely to divorce in later life.While for women, there was no significant link.The research also found men taught in boys' schools were more likely to suffer from depression by age 42--perhaps because of their increased chances of marital breakdown.But Professor Leonard's team was unable to identify why those men educated in a single-sex environment were more likely to divorce. The study asked married and _ g couples where men had attended both single-sex and mixed schools to rate how happy they were and found no marked difference in their happiness levels or willingness to share domestic chores.

Movie title: Afghan Breakdown Context: The events unfold just before the start of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1988. Lieutenant Steklov, son of a high-ranking General, is assigned to Afghanistan, hoping to take part in combat and earn some medals before the war ends. Sgt. Arsionov (Aleksei Serebryakov) combines his combat experience and bravery with brutal hazing of young conscripts back on the field base. Major Bandura\`s tour of duty has expired. He is free to go home and reunite with his wife whom he has almost forgot. This means leaving his mistress Katya (Tatyana Dogileva), a nurse in the base's hospitalâto a much anticipation from Bandura's superior Leonid (Mikhail Zhygalov) who fell in love with Katya. Anxiety is felt by many characters about the change taking place back in the Soviet Union during the Perestroika. Bandura himself thinks he might not be able to adapt. Katya says that Afghanistan will be remembered as the best part of their lives. The Soviet command arranges a deal with a local Afghan warlord that he won't take action against the withdrawing Soviet troops in exchange for weapons and supplies. When asked why he needs more weapons as the war seems to be coming to an end, he replies that his war will go on for a very long time. On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the mujahedin. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village.

Defeat to Jose Mourinho's men could see Barcelona eliminated.","completion":"Title: Barcelona's Road to Victory: High Stakes and Uncertain Futures for Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic Introduction Barcelona's iconic Nou Camp will soon bear witness to a significant match against Inter Milan, one that could alter the course of the 2021-2022 season. With the daunting prospect of facing Jose Mourinho's formidable squad, the Catalan giants are sweating over the fitness levels of their leading scorers: Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. With both stars' participation currently shrouded in doubt, their absence could open up avenues for the opposition, thereby putting the risk of a potential elimination on the horizon. The Importance of Messi and Ibrahimovic It is no secret that the partnership between Messi and Ibrahimovic in the frontline has been instrumental in shaping the success of Barcelona in recent years. Playing alongside each other, these exceptional athletes have forged a symbiotic relationship characterized by precision, agility, and uncanny coordination; not to mention, an unparalleled ability to transform seemingly innocuous plays into awe-inspiring goals. Thus, despite having a star-studded lineup packed with talented players, the potential absence of this powerful duo casts an ominous shadow on Barcelona's chances at victory. The question remains: can the team fend off the challenge by Mourinho's men? Mourinho's Strategies and Inter Milan's Threat Jose Mourinho is a master tactician, with a penchant for identifying and exploiting his opponent's weaknesses. In the lead-up to the match at Nou Camp, it is expected that the former Manchester United and Chelsea coach will emphasize the fragile state of his rival's frontline. Armed with such knowledge, Mourinho's Inter Milan squad, featuring the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez, can launch relentless attacks and create defensive chaos. Moreover, Inter Milan has consistently exhibited solid defensive capabilities and tactical flexibility, characteristics that have posed challenges for even the most formidable opponents. Consequently, if Barcelona lacks the prowess of Messi and Ibrahimovic, they are forced to compete on an uneven playing field and increase their chances of elimination. The Prospects for Barcelona Given the sheer importance of the upcoming match and the uncertainty surrounding their leading stars' fitness levels, Barcelona's coaching staff is undoubtedly working tirelessly to find alternative solutions. The adaptability of a team to perform under pressure while facing major setbacks can indeed alter the course of a season. For Barcelona, this could mean relying on the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Ansu Fati to fulfill the offensive void potentially left by the injured duo. Both players have showcased their talent in the past, and the critical situation could drive them to greatness on the field. In terms of tactical adjustments, manager Ronald Koeman might consider adopting a more cautious approach, maintaining a solid defensive structure while relying on counterattacks as the primary offensive weapon. This tactic could mitigate Inter's expected aggressive stance and provide Barcelona some much-needed breathing space. Conclusion As the suspense regarding the fitness of Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to build, it is inevitable that the outcome of the match against Inter Milan carries vast implications. Should Barcelona emerge victorious despite the absence of their star players, the narrative stands to shift: the Catalan giants will have proven their resilience in the face of adversity, using the momentum to catapult themselves forward. On the other hand, a defeat would ignite questions and doubts; yet, at the same time, it would provide an opportunity for self-reflection and growth. Whether or not Messi and Ibrahimovic take the field at Nou Camp against Mourinho's men, it remains clear that the match will create an unforgettable chapter in the sport's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Starring Timothy Olyphant, Stephen Eric McIntyre, Joe Anderson and Rossif Sutherland, \\"High Life\\" is a comedic heist movie from the flip-side of the '80s consumer dream. Hypothesis: High Life features criminal characters","completion":"After analyzing the information provided in the paragraph about the 2009 Canadian film \\"High Life,\\" describing it as a comedic heist movie and considering that it is adapted from a stage play by Lee MacDougall, it is possible to come to a conclusion about the hypothesis that the film features criminal characters. A heist movie, by definition, often includes stories about planned robberies, thefts, or other forms of illegal activities. These movies involve characters who conspire to commit the crime, showcasing the planning process and the execution of the heist. In addition, these films often feature tension arising from the interaction between the characters as well as the challenges and consequences they face during and after their criminal endeavor. As \\"High Life\\" is explicitly stated to be a comedic heist movie, it is reasonable to assume that it would feature characters who are involved in some form of criminal activity. It is important to also consider that the story takes place on the \\"flip-side of the '80s consumer dream,\\" which might imply that the characters could be engaging in crime as a means to either attain a better life or to satire the era's materialistic ideals. Taking the description and context of the movie into account, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true: \\"High Life\\" indeed features criminal characters who participate in various illegal activities, as shown from the film being described as a comedic heist movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It continues to debate a special additional tax of about 8 cents per liter on sugary soda. You can understand why Mexican leaders are worried about their nation's eating habits. Mexicans consume more sugary soft drinks per person than any other people on earth. Mexico suffers the highest incidence of diabetes among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Mexicans are more likely to be obese even than Americans, the next runner-up. Taxes on junk foods constitute just a part of a vast fiscal reform proposed by Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the most common signs of ear mite infection is the scratching of the affected ear. This ear scratching is because ear mites can cause considerable irritation. The rabbit may scratch his ears with his paw or rub his ears on the ground. Your rabbit may also shake his head or hold his ear over to one side. Your rabbit’s ears may have reddened or inflamed skin. Irritation from the feces and saliva of the mite causes extreme itchiness, and the rabbit scratches and traumatizes the ear. A severe infection due to ear mites is characterized by distinctive yellow-gray debris and scale that builds up and fills the ear canal. This debris and discharge is tightly adhered to the skin. Attempting to remove the debris causes pain. Forcible removal tends to peel away the top layer of skin with the discharge leaving a large ulcer behind. Typically in the early stages of infection, close inspection may show scales of skin tightly stuck to the ear canal. If ear mites are left untreated, the weight of the collected debris inside the ear can cause it to drop. The rabbit may develop secondary bacterial infections where the skin is damaged, and infection may spread inwards into the middle and inner ear causing poor balance and a head tilt.","completion":"This article discusses the symptoms and consequences of ear mite infections in rabbits, highlighting common signs such as ear scratching, head shaking, and inflamed skin, while stressing the importance of timely treatment to prevent complications like secondary bacterial infections and balance issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Thirty years old and single, Pauline \\"Poppy\\" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive. When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless. Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her student, she comes to the correct conclusion that her student is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A rising population is one of the main reasons that there is global warming. Between 1650 and 1850 the population increased by 0.75 billion people going from 0.25 billion to one billion. From 1930 to the end of the century the population rose from two billion to over six billion. In just a third of the time the population rose by more than five times what it did before. It is expected that this trend in the changing population will continue and could even heighten. The growing population requires increasing amounts of energy. These energy demands and other supplies require production, which almost always involves the emission of greenhouse gases. The more the population increases the more greenhouse gases that are produced and the greater the increase in temperature. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the best-known causes for global warming. The major reason for fossil fuels contributing so much to global warming is the release of carbon that occurs during the burning of fossil fuels. When people burn fossil fuels, they release large amounts of carbon by way of the release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air then leads to global warming. Another source of carbon dioxide comes from _ . In forests there is a large amount of carbon that is stored in the trees and other plants. This carbon is out of the atmosphere because the trees consume the carbon from carbon dioxide. When people cut down trees, they are frequently burned. This burning releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that was stored in organic matter. Even when new trees are planted, it can take up to one hundred years to make up for the carbon that was released. It is commonly thought that because trees absorb more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere experiences positive effects.

Input: Abstract: CONTEXT Whether immunosuppressive treatment adversely affects survival is unclear. OBJECTIVE To assess whether immunosuppressive drugs increase mortality. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study evaluating overall and cancer mortality in relation to immunosuppressive drug exposure among patients with ocular inflammatory diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data derived from medical records, and mortality results from United States National Death Index linkage. The cohort's mortality risk was compared with US vital statistics using standardised mortality ratios. Overall and cancer mortality in relation to use or non-use of immunosuppressive drugs within the cohort was studied with survival analysis. SETTING Five tertiary ocular inflammation clinics. Patients 7957 US residents with non-infectious ocular inflammation, 2340 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs during follow up. Exposures Use of antimetabolites, T cell inhibitors, alkylating agents, and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall mortality, cancer mortality. RESULTS Over 66 802 person years (17 316 after exposure to immunosuppressive drugs), 936 patients died (1.4/100 person years), 230 (24.6%) from cancer. For patients unexposed to immunosuppressive treatment, risks of death overall (standardised mortality ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.11) and from cancer (1.10, 0.93 to 1.29) were similar to those of the US population. Patients who used azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, systemic corticosteroids, or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs. In patients who used cyclophosphamide, overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was non-significantly increased. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with increased overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.98) and cancer mortality (adjusted HR 3.83, 1.13 to 13.01). CONCLUSIONS Most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs do not seem to increase overall or cancer mortality.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Eye contact, a channel of kinesics, is the primary way that people communicate dominance. People establishing dominance will take the liberty of staring at and surveying others while making direct eye contact. They will also be the last person to break eye contact. If you're looking to assert your power, keep in mind that constant eye contact can be intimidating. A person asserting dominance will also refrain from smiling in order to communicate seriousness and may instead frown or purse his lips. Gestures can display dominance; pointing at others and using large gestures is a way to show others your status. In addition, when someone takes a wider and taller stance while also being relaxed, this is another show of dominance. Dominant individuals will also have a firm handshake. They will usually place their hand on top with their palm facing downwards; the grip will be firm and sustained in order to demonstrate control. Those with high status will generally enable more physical space to exist between themselves and lower status people. High-status individuals will also take up more physical space to show their dominance and mastery of the situation. In other words, an expansive pose signals power and achievement. Power is also displayed through standing versus sitting. Standing - and particularly in the foreground - is seen as a more powerful pose. A straight back and strong shoulders kept back, rather than hunching forward, further conveys confidence. Slouching and slumping, by contrast, convey a lack of confidence. Dominant individuals will also lead from the front and walk ahead of the group or go through the doors first. They like to be up front. People asserting their status will have more options when it comes to touch because they feel more confident in their position. Generally, in an unequal situation where one person has a higher status, he will touch the lower-status person with greater frequency. In social situations where both communicators have equal status, both people will reciprocate touch in similar ways. Summary:","completion":"This article highlights how dominance is communicated through eye contact, gestures, body language, physical space, posture, leading positions, and touch, all of which convey power, confidence, and status in various social situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this \\"Consider your age, gender and ethnicity. Evaluate your lifestyle. Understand your personal and family medical history. Talk to your doctor.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Our Health: Tips for Kids and Grown-ups Too! Hi Kids and Grown-ups! Today, we are going to talk about something very important: our health! Health is a big word that means how well our bodies are working. To stay healthy, we need to understand a few things about ourselves. 1. Age, Gender, and Ethnicity First, let's think about who we are. We all have different ages, like how old you are when you celebrate your birthday. Our gender is if we are a boy or a girl. And, our ethnicity tells us about where we come from and the different traditions we have. All these things can affect our health. For example, some sicknesses happen more to older people, and others more to kids. Boys and girls might have different health problems too. And sometimes, people from different places might have different health issues. 2. Evaluate Your Lifestyle Lifestyle means the things that we do every day — like how much we play, sleep, study, and eat. Being active is very important, like running on the playground or playing sports. But sometimes, we need to slow down, take a nap, or get a good night's sleep. It's also important to eat healthy food, like fruits, vegetables, and yummy snacks that give us energy. A healthy lifestyle is like having a superpower that keeps us strong and not get sick easily! 3. Know Your Personal and Family Medical History Sometimes, we might have a sickness because it runs in our family. This means people in our family had the same sickness before — like our mom, dad, brothers or sisters, even our grandmas and grandpas. It is good to know about these things because it helps us take better care of ourselves. 4. Talk to Your Doctor Doctors are our friends who help us stay healthy. Just like how we talk to our friends and parents about our day, we can share with the doctors anything we feel about our health. We should tell the doctor if we are feeling sick or something is different, even if it seems small. The doctors will listen to us, ask questions, and maybe even do some tests. They help us understand what is happening and treat our health problems. Oh, and remember — always tell a grown-up if you are feeling sick or need to see the doctor. They care about us and will be there to help! So, friends, that's it! It's important to know about our age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, and family history, and talk to our doctor to understand our health. Let's stay healthy and happy together!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Article: President Obama remarks on the situation with admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden, saying he has no plans to disrupt relations with Russia and China, nor to scramble jets to capture the \\"29-year-old hacker.\\" President Obama said he should not have to speak personally with the leaders of Russia and China regarding self-professed NSA leaker Edward Snowden, and said he was “not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker” during a press conference in Senegal on Thursday. The president was on the first leg of a trip to Africa when he struck the seemingly dismissive tone regarding the former defense contractor who claimed to have leaked details of two top-secret government data-gathering programs before initiating an international manhunt that has grown to involve the governments of China, Ecuador, and Russia. Obama said that the revelations first published in British newspaper The Guardian and The Washington Post – and the ensuing search for Snowden, who has been charged with theft of government property and two offenses of espionage statutes – have the makings of a big-screen spy caper, but that he would not engage in “wheeling and dealing and trading and a whole host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so he can face the justice system here in the United States.” Snowden, 30, is believed to still be hiding at a Moscow airport awaiting a ruling on his request for asylum from the government of Ecuador. Snowden flew to Russia from Hong Kong over the weekend but has not been seen since his arrival. Russian officials told Reuters that he remains in a transit area at Sheremetyevo airport. He was not aboard an Aeroflot flight that departed Moscow to Havana on Thursday, the first stop on an anticipated escape route to the South American country. “Now I get why it’s a fascinating story from a press perspective and I’m sure there will be a made-for-TV movie somewhere down the line,” Obama said, adding that “in terms of U.S. interests, the damage was done with respect to the initial leaks.” Dolores Ochoa / AP A man reads a newspaper with the Spanish headline \\"Snowden stuck at Moscow airport\\" in Quito, Ecuador, on Wednesday. Snowden’s case resolved “some pretty significant vulnerabilities” at the National Security Agency, Obama said. Snowden worked for defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton before being fired, and said in an interview with the South China Morning Post that he took the job to gain access to sensitive information. NBC News could not independently verify the report. “There have been some useful conversations that have taken place between the United States government and the Russian government,” Obama said. “And my continued expectation is that Russia – there are other countries that have talked about potentially providing Mr. Snowden asylum – recognize that they are part of an international community and that they should be abiding by international law.” The U.S. is worried that Snowden might have other documents in his possession that he may “dribble out,” Obama said. “I continue to be concerned about the other documents that he may have. That’s part of the reason why we’d like to have Mr. Snowden in custody,” Obama said. “But what I think we’re going to continue to do is make sure that we are following the various channels that are well established and the rules that are well established to get this thing done.” Ecuador’s communications minister said on Thursday that his country renounced hundreds of millions of dollars in trade tariff benefits, the Associated Press reported. Communications Minister Fernando Alvarez said the trade benefits being considered for renewal by U.S. lawmakers had become an “instrument of blackmail” as the country considered granting asylum to Snowden. Ecuador “does not accept threats from anybody, and does not trade in principles, or submit to mercantile interests, as important as they may be,” Alvarez said, according to the AP. In Washington, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has threatened to lead the effort to remove preferential trade treatment for Ecuadorian goods if the country decides to offer asylum to Snowden. \\"Edward Snowden is a fugitive who has endangered the national security of the United States,\\" Sen. Robert Menendez said in a statement released late on Wednesday. \\"Trade preferences are a privilege granted to nations, not a right. I urge [Ecuadorean] President Correa to do the right thing by the United States and Ecuador, and deny Snowden's request for asylum.\\" Hours later, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman told reporters the administration had accepted an industry petition to consider revoking Ecuador's benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences program. That petition actually pre-dates current tension between the two countries over Snowden. In 2012, Ecuador exported some 5.4 billion worth of oil, 166 million of cut flowers, 122 million of fruits and vegetables and 80 million of tuna to the United States. Menendez said he would lead efforts to stop the renewal of Ecuador's duty-free access to America markets under the Generalized System of Preferences program, which expires on July 31. He also said he'd try and block renewal of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, which also expires at the end of July. The ongoing incident has also heightened tensions with China, as the country’s defense minister said that the U.S. Internet monitoring program revealed in documents leaked by Snowden “has revealed the concerned country’s true face and hypocritical behavior.” Defense ministry spokesman Yang Yujun did not explicitly name the United States in his comments, Reuters reported. Also on Thursday, a government official in Switzerland said the country still has questions about Snowden's time working in Geneva as a CIA operative, Reuters reported. Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter said they received a \\"diplomatic\\" response from the U.S. to questions about Snowden's time in the country from 2007 and 2009, but \\"have decided to discuss these points further in the future with the Americans.\\" NBC News' Ghazi Balkiz and Reuters contributed to this report. Related: This story was originally published on ||||| His remarks on Mr. Snowden’s case followed similarly toned-down language by his aides on the severity of the problem, reflecting efforts by the administration to smooth relations with Russia and China. Earlier in the day, China’s Defense Ministry accused the administration of hypocrisy, using Mr. Snowden’s disclosures about American surveillance abroad as evidence that China is a victim, not a perpetrator, of cyberspying and hacking. Mr. Snowden’s disclosures have embarrassed the administration and raised debate about the government’s invasion of privacy. Mr. Snowden and his supporters, including WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group, have called him a whistle-blower and a hero. Federal prosecutors have charged him with violating espionage laws, and some American legislators have called him a traitor. Ecuador, which is protecting Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, at its London embassy, has confirmed that Mr. Snowden has requested asylum and has suggested that his human rights could be violated if he were returned to the United States. But Ecuador, which had said it could take months to evaluate the asylum request, suggested Thursday that all the attention focused on its decision was misplaced. Photo “Mr. Snowden is not in Ecuadorean territory and to process an asylum request that is what is required,” the country’s president, Rafael Correa, said during a news conference on Thursday in Quevedo, in western Ecuador. “We received the asylum request, we have studied it and that is precisely the first conclusion, that to process it to finally approve it or deny it he must be in Ecuadorean territory.” Asked if he had considered bringing Mr. Snowden to Ecuador or to one of his country’s embassies, he said, “No.” Mr. Correa also disputed assertions made earlier in the week by Mr. Assange and others that Mr. Snowden had been given travel documents by Ecuador that assured him safe passage to the country. “The government has not authorized any safe-conduct or refugee permit for Mr. Snowden,” Mr. Correa said. Referring to a safe-conduct document that appeared to have been issued by Ecuador’s embassy in London, he said that if it turned out to be authentic, “whoever issued it is totally without authority.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Saying they would not bow to threats, officials in Ecuador also announced that they were unilaterally renouncing preferential trade privileges given to the country by the United States. Those privileges, which apply to Ecuadorean exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars, were to expire at the end of July, and were unlikely to be renewed by Congress because of the strained relationship between the two countries. Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned Ecuador on Wednesday that its “trade preferences could be revoked” if it granted Mr. Snowden’s asylum request. Photo Russian officials have said they consider Mr. Snowden a free man and have hinted that they were pressuring him to leave. President Vladimir V. Putin said Tuesday that “the sooner he chooses his final destination, the better for us and for him.” Whether he is feeling pressure to leave is unclear: a Russian immigration official close to the situation said that Mr. Snowden was entitled to stay in the airport as long as he wanted, even though he has not asked for a Russian visa or received one. An extended stay in Russia would seem to narrow Mr. Snowden’s options, allowing American officials to dangle carrots and sticks before countries like Ecuador and Venezuela that are considering granting him asylum. A buzz of suspense surrounded Flight 150 to Havana on Thursday at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, with expectations that Mr. Snowden would be a passenger. But no unusual security measures were visible as passengers boarded the flight, with two dozen reporters and photographers pressed against the terminal window as the plane backed away from the gate. Journalists from Reuters and ABC, who had booked tickets in hopes of interviewing Mr. Snowden, said it appeared that he was not on board. ||||| How Snowden was identified as Ars user TheTrueHOOHA June 5, 2013 The Guardian and The Washington Post begin publishing top secret leaked NSA documents. June 9 Edward Snowden reveals he's the leaker. June 12, early afternoon Reuters publishes a profile indicating that Snowden used to use the online username \\"The True HOOHA.\\" June 12, afternoon Anthony DeRosa publishes an article noting that hundreds of posts were written on Ars Technica forums by a user named TheTrueHOOHA, with many biographical details that line up with Snowden. June 12, Later afernoon Business Insider and Buzzfeed both publish articles confirming that TheTrueHOOHA is Snowden, noting that he published photos of himself on Ars and elsewhere. June 12, 8:33pm EST Ars Technica reviews Snowden posts and publishes an article about Snowden's \\"life on Ars.\\" June 13-21 NY Times, LA Times, Washington Post, many others write about Snowden's activity on Ars. Ed Snowden was 23 years old when he moved to Geneva in 2007. Soon after arriving, he was looking for a taste of home. It wasn't that he was unhappy. Snowden's life was becoming the adventure he'd been looking for. Moving to Switzerland hadn't been his first choice—his dream picks were in Asia and Australia—but it certainly wasn't bad. Hired by the CIA and granted a diplomatic cover, he was a regular old IT guy whose life was elevated by a hint of international intrigue. Snowden would soon move into a four-bedroom apartment covered by the agency. He'd blow off parking tickets, citing diplomatic immunity. He'd travel the continent. He befriended an Estonian rock star (\\"the funniest part is he's a SUPER NERD\\"), raced motorcycles in Italy, took in the Muslim call to prayer from his Sarajevo hotel room, and formed opinions about the food and the women in Bosnia, in Romania, in Spain. But as his first spring dawned in Switzerland, it must have felt cold, foreign, and expensive. Two days after his arrival in Switzerland, Snowden logged onto #arsificial, a channel on Ars Technica's public Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server. He'd been frequenting this space for a few months, chatting with whomever happened to be hanging out. < TheTrueHOOHA> You guys can't say I look gay anymore. < User1> you look gay < TheTrueHOOHA> not anymore. I'm living in switzerland. i'm the straightest looking man inthe country < User2> rolpix < TheTrueHOOHA> as soon as my camera makes it here. :P < TheTrueHOOHA> you guys wouldn't believe how expensive shit is here, either < TheTrueHOOHA> you can't get tap water in restaraunts < User2> some examples, please < TheTrueHOOHA> they make you buy it in bottles < TheTrueHOOHA> glass bottles. 5 bucks a pop < User2> you buy the tap water? < TheTrueHOOHA> hamburgers are 15 The 15 hamburgers weren't even as good as McDonald's; they tasted \\"like greasy cardboard.\\" Everything was written in French and measured in meters (\\"God I hate metric,\\" wrote Snowden. \\"Why can't they use real numbers over here?\\"). The food packages had \\"kilojoules\\" listed on them. (\\"I'm not a battery!\\") Europeans couldn't even play movies right. (\\"They put an intermission in 300.\\") Snowden logged on to the public IRC chat room with the same username he used across the Web: TheTrueHOOHA. The chat room was a place he would return to on dozens of occasions over his years in Switzerland, and his writings fill in details about the man who may go down as the most famous leaker in US history. Over the years that he hung out in #arsificial, Snowden went from being a fairly insulated American to being a man of the world. He would wax philosophical about money, politics, and in one notable exchange, about his uncompromising views about government leakers. Four years later, Snowden took a job with a government contractor for the specific purpose of gathering secret information on domestic spying being done by the National Security Agency (NSA). In May, he hopped a plane to Hong Kong before the NSA knew where he was going. Once there, Snowden began a process of leaking top-secret documents to journalists. Snowden's first leak confirmed what activists had suspected but couldn't prove: there was a dragnet government surveillance program collecting information on every American's phone calls. The chat logs are the most detailed view available into the formation of a man who has been hailed as a hero, and condemned as a traitor by leaders in his own country. In his public statements, Snowden is smooth and uncompromising, radiating intelligence. Snowden has insisted the focus remain on the leaked documents, not him. But he has also kept himself in the spotlight, speaking to three newspapers, doing live Q&As, and dribbling out more documents over time. Intentional or not, Snowden has maximized media attention. He is a Deep Throat for the social media age. Revealing American secrets is not enough; he has applied to be their chief interpreter as well. An acerbic user, at home on #arsificial IRC isn't Twitter. Much of the talk in chat channels isn't much more elevated than barroom banter, and Snowden's conversations as TheTrueHOOHA are no exception. But his personality and his beliefs do shine through. IRC chats can hold meaningful revelations about public figures, and Ars has used them as a reporting source before. Snowden was the kind of bar buddy willing to get into a political argument and never give up, even if he pissed off the whole room. If IRC is a bar, then the #arsificial channel is the back room occupied by drinkers who feel the front is just too stuffy for them. Officially unofficial, #arsificial was created by users who chafed at the moderation in other Ars chatrooms. \\"This channel is unsupported and has no rules as such,\\" reads an automated message sent to users upon entry. Unlike on other Ars channels, for instance, chatter veering into racism or sexism wouldn't get a user silenced. \\"Under no circumstances should anyone complain to #mods about conduct in this channel,\\" read the entry message. \\"Anyone taking any complaint about #arsificial to #mods will receive a ban from #arsificial.\\" It was an online destination Snowden would return to dozens of times over the next four years, often remaining quiet for hours on end before engaging in bursts of dialogue. The chat snippets show a strident personality, and at times, the inchoate ideology of a man who would ultimately take drastic measures to fight government secrecy. In #arsificial, Snowden was frequently someone ready to go to the mat for his beliefs—even when no one was on his side. And he could be abrasive. Snowden didn't short stocks just to make money—he did it because it was the right thing to do. He saw himself as a paladin of the markets, bringing \\"liquidity\\" to all. As for those who didn't agree with him about the rightness of the gold standard or the need to eliminate Social Security, they weren't just mistaken—they were \\"retards.\\" Four years ago, Snowden presented an image of always being sure of himself, sometimes to the point of seeming arrogant. He often thought he was the smartest guy in the room, and he let others know it. The Ars IRC server doesn't log conversations, and there are no official transcripts of any discussions on that server. However, after learning that Snowden appeared to be an Ars user, we received chat logs from multiple longtime users who recalled IRC conversations with the user known as TheTrueHOOHA. That IRC user claimed he was the registered Ars user TheTrueHOOHA, who posted nearly 800 posts in Ars forums, including biographical information and photos that match Snowden. Any handle can be adopted in IRC. However, such \\"identity theft,\\" while theoretically possible, is unheard of. These IRC remarks—like the Ars forum posts—correlate precisely to publicly known facts about Snowden's life. Life in Switzerland By April, a few months into his Swiss adventure, the chats show that Snowden was warming to the country. \\"Yeah… It's pretty cool so far,\\" he wrote. \\"The girls are gorgeous, too. Oh, and prostitution is legal.\\" He detailed cultural observations about Switzerland, and his travels elsewhere, to anyone who happened to be in the chat room. \\"Jesus christ are the swiss rich,\\" he wrote. \\"The fucking mcdonald's workers make more than I do. They make like 50,000 franc a year.\\" < TheTrueHOOHA> the roads are 35 inches wide < TheTrueHOOHA> with 9000 cars on them, two tram tracks, and a bus lane < TheTrueHOOHA> and a bike lane < TheTrueHOOHA> i imagine mirrors get clipped off all the time < TheTrueHOOHA> I'm afraid I'd bump into someone and have to pay for it. < User3> do they have a large immigrant population doing the lower-class work? < TheTrueHOOHA> Yeah.lots of unidentifiable southeast asian people and eastern europeans who don't speak french or english < TheTrueHOOHA> but don't get me wrong -- this place is amazing < TheTrueHOOHA> it's like living in a postcard < User4> TheTrueHOOHA: where are you? .ch? < TheTrueHOOHA> it's just nightmarishly expensive and horrifically classist < TheTrueHOOHA> Yeah.

UPDATED:. 17:06 EST, 4 April 2013. Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre. Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said. 'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.' Scroll down for video. Taking action: Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed strict gun control measures into state law on Thursday while surrounded by the parents of victims from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Relatives: Nicole Hockley (right), the mother of slain Dylan Hockley, hugs State Senator Beth Bye as Neil Heslin (left), the father of victim Jesse Lewis, watches. Emotional: Mark Barden, the father of victim Daniel Barden, cries as he hugs Senator Richard Blumenthal following the signing of the law banning more than 100 weapons. Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday. In the hours after the shooting. December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and. waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home. He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to. wait for the victims to be formally identified. Now, Connecticut joins states. including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having. the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of. mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in. Washington. 'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill. would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including. background checks for all firearms sales. Support: Now Connecticut is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country. Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control. Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed. Following a total of more than 13. hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of. Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill. crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled. General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes. 'I pray today's bill — the most. far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other. families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook. families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz. 'Don't tread on me': Gun control opponents. outside the statehouse in Hartford, Connecticut, as lawmakers debated. the new laws passed last night which ban more than 100 guns and. large-capacity ammo magazines. Gun control advocates: Lauren Garrett, a supporter of gun regulation and her son Robert display a sign that reads 'Ban AR-15's' inside the statehouse in Hartford yesterday. Colorado and New York also passed new. gun control requirements in the wake of the Newtown shooting, in which a. 20-year-old gunman used a military-style semi-automatic rifle. Compared with Connecticut's. legislation, which, for example, bans the sale or purchase of ammunition. magazines holding more than 10 rounds, New York restricted magazines to. seven bullets and gave owners of higher-capacity magazines a year to. sell them elsewhere. Colorado banned ammunition magazines that hold more. than 15 rounds. President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action. Connecticut House majority leader Joe. Aresimowicz said of last night's decision: 'I pray today's bill - the. most far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent. other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26. Sandy Hook families have felt.' Some of the measures take effect. right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban,. background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or. purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups. The massacre reignited a national. debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of. the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the. shooting. His proposed gun control measures. have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip. to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in. Washington. Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model. Long debate: Rob Kane, a Republican senator serving towns in western Connecticut, left, questions Senate President Donald Williams, D-Brooklyn, during a discussion of a gun bill on the Senate floor last night. Tense: Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, left, and Senator Carlo Leone, D-Stamford and Darien, watch a vote for an amendment of the gun-control bill at the Capitol in Hartford. President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre. Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado. But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington. He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls. Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. Senate. President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in. Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends. politics. 'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.' The. bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of. Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues. Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.' Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.' He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families. But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote. 'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school. Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre. 'When. a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The. Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a. community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state. Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton. Horror: Connecticut State Police lead a line of. children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. on Friday, December 14, 2012 after the massacre at the school which. claimed 26 lives. Grief: Young children wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shootings. Tears: A woman waits to hear about her sister, a teacher, following a shooting at the Sandy Hook. Gun rights advocates, who greatly. outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the. day at the Capitol, railed against the proposals as misguided and. unconstitutional. Newtown school gunman Adam Lanza: He slaughtered. 20 first-grade pupils and six teachers with shots from a legally bought high-powered rifle. 'No! No! No!' and 'Read the bill!' they chanted. 'We want them to write laws that are sensible,' said Ron Pariseau, of Pomfret, who was angry he'll be made a felon if he doesn't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in Connecticut. 'What they're proposing will not stop anything.' By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read. The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning. Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal. 'It's just the beginning of this bill. In six months from now, it's going to get stronger and stronger,' Dan Garrett said. 'I think they're watching us all over the country.' Highlights:","completion":"1. Connecticut Governor Dannel P.

Josh A:","completion":"Step 1: Determine a setting and time period for our movie plot. To create a relatable and engaging story, let's choose a modern, urban setting in the United States. Our protagonist, Josh, will be in his mid-20s, struggling with the loss of his parents and dealing with the pain that comes with it. The time period of the story will be during the present day. Step 2: Flesh out our main character, Josh. Josh is a young man who recently lost his parents in a tragic accident, leaving him overwhelmed with grief and pain. He's been trying to take care of himself and his younger sister, Lily, who is still in high school. Josh works long hours at a local restaurant, barely making ends meet, while also taking care of his sister. Step 3: Introduce a supernatural element or external conflict to drive the story forward. While walking home late one night, Josh stumbles upon an old, mysterious woman who seems to have a deep understanding of his pain. She offers him the chance to wish for relief from his suffering. Josh, desperate to find some solace, accepts her offer, not knowing what consequences his wish might bring. Step 4: Develop the consequences of the wish and how Josh's life changes. After making the wish, Josh finds that his emotional pain has been transferred to his sister, Lily. She now bears all of the grief and sorrow that Josh once carried, and Josh must come to terms with the consequences of his wish. Step 5: Create a conflict resolution or a path of redemption for Josh. Realizing the terrible mistake he's made, Josh becomes determined to find a way to take back his pain and help his sister. Through a series of trials, he learns the importance of facing his grief head-on and learning to cope with it, rather than wishing it away. The old mysterious woman reappears and sees the transformation of Josh's character. She agrees to undo the wish, allowing Josh to take his pain back from Lily. Step 6: Concludes the story with an emotional realization and conclusion. Josh and Lily's journey leads them to understand the importance of facing life's challenges together and supporting one another through their pain. The siblings grow closer, and their bond becomes stronger. The movie ends with Josh and Lily finding the strength to move forward, using their shared experiences to build a brighter future. So, to summarize, the movie plot revolves around Josh, a young man struggling with his parent's sudden death and the pain it caused. Desperate for relief, he accepts an offer from a mysterious old woman to transfer his pain, only to find that his sister takes on this burden. Racked with guilt, Josh undertakes a series of trials to undo his wish and learns to face his grief, eventually strengthening his bond with his sister and moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emotional distress encompasses a wide range of feelings, including sadness, fear, anger, and confusion, which children may experience when their parents separate. The other options do not seem to accurately reflect the primary concern of most parents during a divorce: - Bad feelings: Although this may also be a consequence of divorce, it is too vague and does not capture the full range of emotions children may experience. - Richer: While financial concerns may arise during a divorce, the couple's primary concern is likely the emotional well-being of their children, rather than making them richer. - Freedom: While divorce may lead to a sense of freedom for the parents, it is unlikely this would be their main concern regarding its impact on their children. - Two Christmases: This option highlights a possible positive aspect for the children; however, it is not the primary concern for parents during a divorce. Therefore, the option \\"emotional distress\\" is the most suitable choice, as it reflects the common concerns of parents during a divorce and acknowledges the range of emotions their children may experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oh, boy, God bless the 1970's, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and now, Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? It's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. Whenever Marcella leaves the room, Raggedy Ann, along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcella's birthday, a new doll, Babette, arrives from Paris, France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However, the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel, he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge of a cliff, into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me, it just gets weirder from this point on. While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie, this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it, you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was, I have to admit I'm glad I watched it, sometimes you need a \\"WTF?!\\" movie to spice up your selection, believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. It's official, that doll is just plain creepy, let's just put it this way, there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother, a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs. Yikes. 7/10 Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"The review is mixed with both positive and negative aspects. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's creativity and appreciates the hand-drawn animation, stating that the movie is \\"pretty creative\\" and the animators put their \\"heart into it.\\" They also give it a 7 out of 10, which is a positive-leaning score.

Write a title for this article: In only a few days, South Korea's biggest scandal in years has done what six decades of diplomacy and bloodshed couldn't. It has united the rival Koreas, at least in one area: indignation against South Korea's leader. North Korea's propaganda mavens have never been shy in calling South Korean President Park Geun-hye an incompetent, power-hungry clone of her late dictator father, Park Chung-hee — and that's when they're pulling their punches. Inconceivable a week ago, many South Koreans now seem to be reaching Pyongyang levels of fury over an investigation into whether Park allowed a longtime confidante with no official government role to manipulate her administration from the shadows. The North's fondness for vicious threats is generally missing in the South, but the anger over the scandal — sometimes partisan, mostly spontaneous on the part of many South Koreans, but more violent and somewhat canned in the North, where carefully cultivated outrage is a state commodity — often seems to be in lockstep. For instance, in wording that North Korea would be right at home with, Ahn Cheol-soo, a lawmaker from a small South Korean opposition party and a potential presidential candidate, recently said of Park: \\"You no longer have the authority to destroy the constitution. You no longer have the authority to stomp on the pride of our people.\\" Here's how a similar sentiment looked when North Korea's main newspaper recently attacked Park: \\"It's deplorable that the South's politics have become the joke of the world and its economy and people's livelihoods are left in shreds.\\" To be clear, the expressions in South Korea, even at their sharpest, are still a long way from the odious linguistic swamp of violence and sexism that characterizes much of North Korea's propaganda. The North, for instance, has called Park a \\"dirty prostitute who licks her master's groin,\\" an \\"aging witch,\\" a \\"female dog\\" and an \\"American parrot.\\" Pyongyang has also repeatedly called for her death. But there has been an uptick in both rage and sexism in the South, especially online, where Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, have been called \\"crazy bitch,\\" ''chicken head,\\" a slur meant to attack their intelligence, and \\"stupid Gangnam ajumma,\\" a term often used to insult middle-aged women living in affluent southern Seoul. People have also declared that South Korea will never again vote for a female president or trust a woman's leadership. It is not just happening in obscure corners of South Korea's social media or the web, never the cream of public discourse. \\"Park Geun-hye threw away her authority as (the person) ultimately responsible (for governing the state) to a common street woman of unknown roots,\\" Jae-myung Lee, the opposition mayor of Seongnam, told more than 10,000 people taking part in a recent anti-Park rally, referring to Choi. \\"Park has lost her authority as president and has shown that she doesn't have the basic qualities to govern a country.\\" That Park, who has 15 months to go in her single five-year term, should go has long been a mainstay of North Korean rhetoric. But similar sentiments are also emerging in South Korean media. \\"If we had to pick one person who made the country into the shattered mess that it is now, it's none other than President Park,\\" the South's Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday, calling for Park's resignation. \\"The citizens no longer want Park to govern state affairs ... She lost the political leadership to persuade and guide the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament and the people. Her moral authority as the head of state has fallen to the ground ... Continuing this state for another year and three months will make everyone miserable.\\" North Korea's state media have at times seemed overwhelmed with the amount of negative stories, both international and South Korean, about Park, and have often just rounded up the coverage, with some insulting comment added. Six days after Park first acknowledged that she had sent Choi, the daughter of a shadowy religious figure who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, drafts of her speeches for editing, North Korea's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, released a lengthy, painstaking summary of the saga, replete with sexist, violent insults. The newspaper described Park and Choi as \\"two women who have lost their minds.\\" It also broke down reports that Choi influenced important government decisions, including Park's move to shut down the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, a jointly run factory park in the North Korean city of Kaesong. \\"This shows to the world that Park Geun-hye is not merely a first-class dog controlled by a large monster that is the United States, but also doubly and triply a puppet manipulated by strings pulled by one 'Gangnam' woman,\\" the North Korean newspaper said, referring to the Seoul neighborhood where Choi reportedly built a fortune on real estate investments. Observers of North Korean propaganda have wondered about the length of time it took the newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party, to weigh in on the scandal — nearly a week. It's almost as if the paper's propaganda experts, after firing at much smaller targets for so long, couldn't quite believe the huge gift they'd been given. Pyongyang has more recently stepped things up. For instance, the North's official Korean Central News Agency published a statement by a Foreign Ministry unit said that Park's actions had caused a \\"hideous power-backed scandal unprecedented in history.\\" It predicted that a \\"mass struggle\\" of enraged South Koreans will leave Park at a crossroads where she is forced to choose between quitting her presidency on her own or facing impeachment. With tens of thousands of South Korean protesters calling for Park's ouster over the weekend and bigger crowds expected in coming days, Pyongyang's breathless, over-the-top propaganda might not be so far off the mark. Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.","completion":"Title: \\"Unprecedented Scandal Unites North and South Korea in Outrage: The Shadows Manipulating South Korea's Leader\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: He wondered if this recommendation was the appropriate place. This sentence implies that a character is questioning the suitability of a recommendation and whether it is the correct location or option for a specific purpose. There is some uncertainty involved, with the character expressing doubt or seeking confirmation. Sentence 2: He inquired if the recommendation was appropriate Similar to the first sentence, this statement also suggests that the character is voicing a concern about the recommendation. The difference lies in the choice of words – \\"inquired\\" and \\"appropriate.\\" The verb \\"inquired\\" implies that the character is actively seeking information, while \\"appropriate\\" signifies the question is about the overall suitability rather than being about the location or option specifically. Now, let's examine the three options presented: 1. Yes: This option would suggest that the situation or information expressed in Sentence 2 can be directly derived from Sentence 1. While both sentences are related and involve a character asking about the recommendation, they are not exactly the same, as the focus of the inquiry is slightly different. 2. It is not possible to tell: Given that both sentences revolve around the character questioning the recommendation and its suitability, it could be argued that there is some level of entailment between them. However, the differences in the wording and focus of the inquiry make it unclear if the second sentence is wholly entailed by the first one. 3. No: This option implies that there is no relationship between the two sentences and that the situation or information in Sentence 2 cannot be inferred from Sentence 1. While there are differences between the two, they are structurally related and represent a character questioning a recommendation. Considering this analysis, the most accurate answer is (2). It is not possible to tell if the second sentence is entirely entailed by the first sentence. Although there are connections between the two, especially the aspect of inquiry regarding a recommendation and its appropriateness, the focus of the inquiry is subtly different in each sentence.

To help you decide, here's a more comprehensive answer that addresses the question: The main figure who contacted Prophet Muhammad was the Angel Gabriel (also known as Jibril in Arabic), who is considered one of the most prominent angels in Islam and other Abrahamic religions. The first revelation to Muhammad occurred in 610 AD, when he was meditating in the Cave of Hira, near Mecca. It was at this time that Angel Gabriel appeared to him and conveyed the first words of God (Allah) to Muhammad, beginning the period of his prophethood. These revelations from Allah through Angel Gabriel continued intermittently over a period of 23 years, and the messages were later compiled into the Islamic holy book, the Quran. As the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad was responsible for relaying these revelations to the people as guidance and instruction. The suggested answer provides some background information on Muhammad's life prior to his prophetic experience, such as his work as a merchant and shepherd and his marriage at the age of 25. However, it does not address the specific question of who contacted him.

Grant for The New York Times Landon Garrett, 7, left, and Collin Troll, 6, at Montauk Marine Basinâs shark-hunting contest last month. This weekend the marine basin will host a different kind of tournament, in which not a single shark will be killed. More Photos » MONTAUK, N.Y. â This seaside community is increasingly getting attention as a trendy summer playground for the wealthy, but for decades it has been known for something else entirely: killing sharks. The shark-fishing craze started here in the 1970s with a colorful push from a local angler, Frank Mundus, who popularized what he called âMonster Fishingâ and who was a model for the grizzled shark hunter, Quint, in âJaws.â Today the piers are decorated with tails and dorsal fins of the sharks that swim these parts: threshers, makos, blues and the occasional great whites. The collection is replenished by the annual tournaments that offer pots of hundreds of thousands of dollars for the biggest sharks. The winning beast is hung by its tail, like a toothy testimony to manâs fear conquered. Every now and then environmentalists would show up, carrying signs warning about the global decline of shark populations from overfishing and calling for an end to the slaughter. They were mostly ignored in a place where bumper stickers declare that the National Marine Fisheries Service, which regulates fishing hauls, has been âDestroying Fishermen and Their Communities Since 1976.â But times change. And this summer, an artist, April Gornik, and an environmental group, Concerned Citizens of Montauk, led a successful effort to persuade some of the most prominent shark fishermen to try something new, and they hope, lasting: a contest where not a single shark is killed. Instead, all of the sharks caught in the contest, being held this weekend, will be photographed and released where they are caught. Fishermen will be asked to use circle hooks, believed to inflict less damage on the fish. And they will be asked to help scientific study by attaching tracking tags to select sharks before they are let go. The winner, determined based on a point system, will receive a painting by Ms. Gornik and 6,000. It is enough to make some of the old fishermen here wonder what is happening to the world. They lament that their friends are letting the environmentalists get to them, and predict that a shark contest without a winning carcass on the dock will not be viewed as a shark contest at all by the hundreds who still come for them. âPeople want to see sharks,â Jack Passie, the captain of the charter boat Windy, which ties off at the Star Island Yacht Club, declared emphatically. But for those who agree to participate â among them the musician Jimmy Buffett, organizers say â it is a chance for Montauk to lead the way once again, this time to help preserve the shark population. âFishermen of Montauk are aware of one thing: The shark fishery is probably going to come to an end down the road,â said Carl Darenberg, the owner of the Montauk Marine Basin, which held one of the first shark-hunting contests in the country 43 years ago and will host the catch-and-release contest. âIf you want to have fish around to catch in the future, you have to make adjustments.â As a fourth-generation Montauk fisherman, Mr. Darenberg, 63, has extra credibility. His great-grandmother came here soon after emigrating from Sweden, having married the local lighthouse keeper. He has been around long enough to remember Mr. Mundus before he was legend. âHe wanted to learn more about how sharks tick,â Mr. Darenberg said one recent afternoon at his bait shop. âAnd he sat there and caught them and caught them and caught them when everybody else was out catching swordfish and marlin.â The technique was simple enough: dump containers of chum into the water and wait for the sharks to be drawn by the wafting odor of blood. Mr. Mundus made a great show of it all the same, playing off the persistent shark phobia. Charging up to 1,800 a day, he would take his passengers â among them the âJawsâ author Peter Benchley â on his âMonster Fishingâ expeditions. His weapon of choice was not a rod and reel but a harpoon attached to a series of floating barrels to wear the fish down. Some saw his techniques as silly, but the results were as plain as the 4,500-pound great white he brought to the piers in the summer of â64. This niche pursuit took off in the 1970s because of two unrelated developments. The swordfish, marlin and tuna pursued by most sport fishermen became increasingly scarce, and the director Steven Spielberg turned Mr. Benchleyâs book into a hit movie. âÂ âJawsâ changed the world,â said Michael Potts, a second-generation Montauk fisherman and the captain of the Blue Fin IV. The town was besieged with aspiring shark hunters, and their appetite was equal to that of their prey. The carcasses piled up. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article and a picture caption misstated part of the name of the marina where a catch-and-release contest will be held this weekend. It is the Montauk Marine Basin, not the Montauk Boat Basin. Summary:","completion":"In Montauk, a seaside community in New York, there has been a long history of shark fishing. People would catch sharks and win prizes for catching the biggest ones. But now there is a new kind of contest where no sharks have to be killed. Instead, people will take pictures of the sharks they catch and let them go free. This helps to protect sharks, many of which are in danger because too many are being caught. Some people are not happy with the change, but others think it is a good way to help keep sharks around for the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Well, the original purpose of building Chernobyl was to make a kind of electricity that doesn't come from wind, water, or coal. This special kind of electricity is called nuclear power, and it's created by a process that happens inside big buildings called nuclear power plants. Chernobyl was one of these power plants. It was built in a place called Ukraine, which is a country far away from here. When Chernobyl was built, people thought it would be a safe and efficient way to make a lot of electricity.

Given the question: Article: An early form of a game in which a ball was kicked around a field is recorded in 1004 B.C. Japan. Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport. Every four years, nearly every country in the world tlghts for the World Cup. Tens of billions of soccer fans from around the world watch the World Cup on television.

Q:SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: An occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people's buttons., the 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct. The story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. He's shiftless, delusional, unable to control his urges, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships, and utterly apathetic about life in general. As the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth. The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ, and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction. He chases off one man (a boyfriend presumably), then chases another at a train station. Later, at a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or perhaps she has more nefarious plans.. She quickly captures Gerard in her web, enticing him with sex and money, having plenty of both. She's also got secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely, and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow, luring Gerard to his death? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to. This is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. It's similar to Verhoeven's<em>Basic instinct</em>, but has a lot more depth, and is certainly more shocking. There's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Input: AITA First off obligatory, I'm a lurker on Reddit, not really a poster so I hope I'm following all the rules. Second, I got the nerve to write this after seeing all the posts lamenting posts seeking validation on here. This story likely has two assholes me (27), him (29) but maybe it's just me, where I'm mostly concerned and wondering if I am, in fact, the asshole is with the very last step: Where I cut my friend off and stopped trying. I'll tell it as simply as I can. This summer I fell into a very deep depression after a bad breakup, which led to a quickly deteriorating relationship with my parents (they liked her more than me and me more when I was with her), and this put a huge strain on me and my job suffered. I hadn't had a roommate in the better part of a decade but I was doing so poorly on my own that I knew I was only looking for one more excuse to commit suicide. Depression has been a part of my life since I was 12 but I'd always been able to cope, up until this summer. I was high most days/nights and developed an issue with painkillers and alcohol. My friend of about 6 months had quickly become one of my best friends and always found an excuse to ask me to move in with him long before all this went down - his motivation was self-admitted as saving on rent money and the fact that this was his first time living alone and didn't like it, also friendship. Me (introvert), him (extrovert). I took him up on the offer one day, explained to him my reason why was that I was afraid to be alone and my lease was up in 3 months anyway. His landlord didn't give a rip about leases and signing papers (another conversation for another day) and that meant everyone was fine with me living there for as long as I needed/wanted. Where things get complicated is with my buddies arrangement he said clearly I would owe no rent on the months I was still paying my old rent. I'd cover all the utilities for those months and generally, he'd just be a good dude. For my old apartment, I was still on the hook for 3 months rent, unless someone started a new lease with them. It would be a per diem kind of thing...1,000/m is 33/day so if someone took over on the 15th of the last month, that would be 500 back to me. Someone did take over on the 23rd of the second month (231 back to me). I paid rent full rent to my friend on the 3rd month. I did not give him the 231 as I probably should have, reason being was my suffering career which was 100% commission (tag [r/choosingbeggers](https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggers)) and I did cover all the utilities for the first two months, we went 50/50 on everything after that. Two months go by. I'm stoned and drunk most nights, I'm making just enough money to pay my bills, eat ramen, and go to therapy for the first time. Never been this kind of broke. I'm not at all better and wouldn't be for several months. My priest, friend, and trusty counsel-giver suggests education and seminary. Says he doesn't care if I become a religious or not and suggests I use this as a way to get a free education, find a new lease on life, and pursue a living that actually means something to me. After a month of deliberation, I took him up on it. I actually get excited again, like really excited, like watched a sunrise and smiled while sipping coffee kind of excited. I tell my roommate, and first words out of his mouth is \\"moocher\\" he immediately says I won't make it and shouldn't do it. I was shocked. I explained that I was open to the religious life but also not expecting it and the diocese knew that, they were just willing to take a chance on me and so I would take a chance on them. I explained that if this didn't work out, the education would still afford me a better, more fulfilling life than I had been living before and I saw this as a way out of my depression and into better living. At this point, he demanded the full second month's rent, which I did not pay and was already 2 months ago, and began wanting rent on a weekly basis. I did pay the rent weekly but told him no on the second months rent as that was already long since spent and couldn't do back payments like that. Every single day he tells me I won't make it in school. Every day I tell him I don't care, I'm trying. I begin to cut him out as just one more negative voice in my head. Some time goes by, he wants all new tires for his truck. He was going to trade labor to the guy for about a quarter of the cost. Me, being the genius that I am just got a new credit card with an introductory 150 bonus if I spent 500 or more in three months, my 400 IQ continues to kick in and I tell him to put it on my card and I'll give him 50 of it. 840 goes onto the credit card. He pays back 400. I go to school. He gives me two post-dated checks for the remaining 480 spread out over one month. I had no problem with this. He cancels both checks a week after I leave and says he'll Venmo me the money when he's ready. I text him once a week for two months, he always says he'll send it next week or next pay period.

Context_4 : Tobacco Road is an historic tobacco-producing area of central North Carolina and is often used when referring to sports (particularly basketball) played among rival Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) universities which are located close to each other in North Carolina. The phrase originated as the title of a novel set in Georgia, but it migrated to North Carolina because of the state's primacy in tobacco production. Three of the schools (Duke, UNC, and North Carolina State) are part of Research Triangle and are separated by no more than 25 mi , and Wake Forest lies about 100 mi west of the other three. It was formerly much closer to the other three, having originally been located in the town of Wake Forest, North Carolina, until 1956. All four are no more than 6 mi from Interstate 40; the road has been called \\"Tobacco Road\\" in national sports media. (However, until the late 1980s—after tobacco had started to decline in North Carolina due to US federal anti-tobacco actions—I-40 did not reach Durham, Chapel Hill, or Raleigh. Rather, \\"Tobacco Road\\" would have been US Highway 70.) The proximity of these schools to one another and the membership of each school in the Atlantic Coast Conference have created a natural rivalry among students, fans, and alumni. North Carolina State University's \\"Red and White Song\\" mentions each of the four universities in its lyrics. Context_5 : The University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United States.

The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president. Context_6 : James W. Silver (June 28, 1907 – July 25, 1988) was a historian, author of \\"Mississippi: The Closed Society\\", and professor at the University of Mississippi and later at the University of Notre Dame and the University of South Florida. When rioting erupted on the Ole Miss campus after James Meredith became the University of Mississippi's first African-American student and federal troops moved in to keep order, Silver befriended Meredith. In a speech to the Southern Historical Association in the Fall of 1963, he analyzed the violence with which Mississippi was resisting desegregation. Mississippi was, he said, \\"a closed society\\" -- \\"totalitarian,\\" \\"monolithic,\\" \\"corrupt.\\" The speech received widespread media coverage, and he expanded his analysis in a book, \\"Mississippi: The Closed Society\\" (1964). His advocacy of racial change had subjected him to hostility in Mississippi and even an attempt by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission to have him fired. That effort failed, but Silver took a job teaching at Notre Dame University in Indiana. He taught at Notre Dame from 1965 until 1969. He left Notre Dame to teach history at the University of South Florida until he retired in 1982.

Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. They are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet including bass Michael McCary, who left the group in 2003 due to health issues. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. Motown issued The Remix Collection, a compilation of remixes of various Boyz II Men songs from Cooleyhighharmony and II. The group itself had opposed the release of the collection, because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as Uncle Sam), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by Epic Records, not Motown. Boyz II Men's third studio album, Evolution, was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of II's (12 million copies) and Cooleyhighharmony (9 million). Only one of Evolution's singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned \\"Four Seasons of Loneliness\\", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed \\"A Song for Mama\\" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film Soul Food) was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up \\"Can't Let Her Go\\" underperformed. The global tour began in 1997 to promote Evolution was very successful in terms of ticket sales, but behind the scenes, Boyz II Men was wracked by conflicts with their record label and internal conflicts among the members of the group. Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group as well. While on tour to support the Evolution album, Wanya Morris developed a polyp on his vocal cords, and the group was forced to postpone part of the tour until he recovered. McCary's scoliosis meant that he was unable to participate in most of the group's dance routines. Boyz II Men were nominated for 2 Grammys in 1998: Best R&B Album for Evolution and Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for \\"A Song for Mama\\".

As a newcomer Layton receives a chilly welcome from his squad. PFC Holley (Van Johnson) returns to the company after recuperating from a wound sustained from fighting in the Netherlands. Instead of going on leave in Paris, the squad is trucked back to the front to help stop a surprise German breakthrough in the Ardennes. They stop that night in the town of Bastogne. The platoon is put up for the night in the apartment of a local young woman, Denise (Denise Darcel), with whom Holley hopes to fraternize. Jarvess (John Hodiak) is informed by Denise that she is taking care of two orphaned French girls. Jarvess later goes on guard in the village, where he runs into a group of battle weary soldiers.

Does it follow that \\"Albert smiled.\\"? Choose your answer from: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no;","completion":"Yes, it follows that \\"Albert smiled.\\" A detailed and long answer explaining this would consider the quotation's context and how it describes Albert's reaction. The statement \\"A delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance\\" points towards Albert's emotional response or satisfaction to whatever has been said to him. In this context, \\"countenance\\" refers to a person's facial expression, which plays a significant role in conveying their emotional state. The use of the word \\"delighted\\" gives a strong hint that Albert's reaction is a positive one—he is pleased with the statement or question directed at him. Additionally, the phrase \\"grin spread slowly\\" indicates a gradual, increasing expression of contentment or happiness, leading to a smile. Thus, we can associate the detailed description of Albert's reaction, where it's mentioned that the \\"delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance,\\" with Albert smiling. His facial expression clearly reveals his satisfaction, and the grin slowly becoming more prominent aligns with the concept of smiling.

(CNN) -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state, an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday. In an hours-long process, 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office. A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement. Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. On Wednesday, lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote, making for a slow process. The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29, giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya's fate. The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month. \\"We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the [Honduran] Congress would have approved his return,\\" Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington. \\"Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled. It has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept President Zelaya as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of Honduras throughout this political crisis.\\" The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis, in addition to the unity government. \\"The absence of democratic, constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo,\\" a senior U.S. administration official said on the conference call, remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation. \\"The election is a step toward a day where Honduras will have an electorally legitimate government in place.\\" Question: \\"Out of the 128-member body, how many lawmakers voted not to return Zelaya to office?\\" Response: \\"132\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Is \\"Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly prescribe the proper, correct and right.\\" the correct answer? Options: A). yes B). no","completion":"B). No The Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy, also known as Purva Mimamsa, primarily emphasizes the interpretation, understanding, and application of sacred texts, especially the Vedas. The Vedas consist of four main collections: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. While the Mīmāṃsākas certainly value the clarity and precision of language, their main focus is on the specific sections of the Vedas, particularly the rituals and duties prescribed in the Karma Kanda. Karma Kanda is the section of the Vedas which deals with ritual action, sacrificial rites, and the performance of duties. It is divided into three parts: Samhitas, or hymns and mantras; Brahmanas, which are commentaries on the rituals in the Samhitas; and the Aranyakas, which are contemplative writings related to the previous two sections. Purva Mimamsa is primarily concerned with analyzing and interpreting the meaning and purpose of the ritual and ethical injunctions found in these sections. Mīmāṃsākas are also known for their philosophical inquiry and deep investigation into the Vedas. This school of thought outlines specific methods and principles for interpreting the text, known as Mimamsa Sutras, which was compiled by the ancient scholar Jaimini. These principles serve as a guide for understanding and implementing the correct conduct, rituals, and sacrifices prescribed in the Vedas. Their focus is largely on observing the specific rituals and duties, rather than seeking the divine or metaphysical truths within the texts. Their interpretation and methods are characterized by a strong emphasis on Dharma (duties and moral order), the power of rituals and actions, and the crucial role of language and grammar in understanding and applying the Vedic texts. While Mīmāṃsākas do consider the purpose and power of language to prescribe the proper, correct, and right way of actions, the answer cannot be reduced to just the statement provided. Their emphasis is more comprehensive, revolving around the proper interpretation of the texts, understanding the prescribed rituals, and adhering to the duties enshrined in the Karma Kanda sections of the Vedas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She invites him to her apartment for tea. A few months later, they are married.Irena is a strange and lonely woman with no friends. She has a fascination with panthers, but animals don't seem to like her very much. When Oliver brings her a Siamese kitten as a gift, for example, the cat hisses at Irena, so they return to the pet store and exchange it for a bird. While in the pet store, Irena's presence sets all the animals to caterwauling. Several weeks later, the bird dies in fear when Irena reaches for it in its cage.Irena is haunted by a tale from her country that tells how the people of her village were witches, devil worshippers, and, under strong emotions like jealousy or anger, could change into panthers. She refers to them as the 'cat people.' Oliver takes it as a folktale, but Irena takes it for real, so real that she refuses to sleep with her husband because she believes that she might kill him.Oliver suggests that Irena see a psychiatrist, so she goes to see Dr Louis Judd [Tom Conway], who was recommended to Oliver by his co-worker, Alice Moore [Jane Randolph]. When Irena returns home after the first session, she finds Oliver and Alice seated on the couch, talking about her.

Only Umayyad ruler (Caliphs of Damascus), Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, is unanimously praised by Sunni sources for his devout piety and justice. In his efforts to spread Islam he established liberties for the Mawali by abolishing the jizya tax for converts to Islam. Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam stated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz also stopped the personal allowance offered to his relatives stating that he could only give them an allowance if he gave an allowance to everyone else in the empire. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was later poisoned in the year 720. When successive governments tried to reverse Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's tax policies it created rebellion. What was Umar ibn Ad al-Aziz's cause of death?","completion":"Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, also known as Umar II, was the Umayyad caliph who ruled from 717 to 720 CE. He is indeed well-known for his piety, justice, and efforts to spread Islam while making it more equitable for converts and non-Arab Muslims. As mentioned in your question, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's cause of death is often attributed to poisoning. This belief is based on historical accounts, which suggest that certain members of the Umayyad dynasty and other influential figures within the empire were not pleased with his reforms, particularly those that affected their wealth and power. These individuals were likely motivated to eliminate Umar II in an attempt to restore the former policies and maintain their status. There is no concrete evidence to corroborate the claim that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was indeed poisoned, as the specific details of his death remain uncertain. However, his sudden demise at a relatively young age, coupled with the political context and the discontent among the elites surrounding his policies, has led many historians to accept poisoning as the probable cause of his death. This tragic event marked the end of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's reign and paved the way for a series of Umayyad rulers who largely overturned his reforms. The aftermath of his death saw uprisings and revolts both due to dissatisfaction with the reversal of his tax policies and a broader sense of unrest within the empire. His passing and the subsequent political turmoil eventually contributed to the decline and eventual fall of the Umayyad dynasty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"The paragraph belongs to the category of \\"mean of transportation\\". In this case, the mode of transportation is in the form of a sea vessel, specifically a Natick-class large district harbor tug called USS Massapequa (YTB-807), which was used by the United States Navy. Named after the town of Massapequa in New York, the purpose of such tugs usually include moving or assisting the movement of other larger vessels such as warships and other naval vessels which may not be able to navigate through narrow waterways or enter certain ports. The tugboat thus acts as a vital component of naval logistics, assisting in re-fuelling, re-supplying and repair operations for other vessels. The Natick-class of tugs were a class of large district harbor tugs that served in the United States navy. They were used for their pulling power and maneuvering capabilities and were named after American Indian tribes, signifying their importance and the respect commanded by their functionality.

Context: The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.","completion":"The problem that mere conduit causes is that it creates a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement.

The step-up in cost basis adjusts the original cost basis (initial value or purchase price) to a new, higher value, which may lead to more favorable tax treatment. Let's delve into some cases when a step-up in the cost basis might occur: 1. Inheritance: The most common situation for a step-up in cost basis is when an individual inherits assets, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, following the death of the original owner. Under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, the cost basis of the inherited assets is adjusted (or \\"stepped up\\") to their fair market value (FMV) at the date of the owner's death. This can be quite advantageous for the inheritor, as it can reduce the capital gains tax liability when the assets are eventually sold. 2. Gift Tax: When an individual receives a gift, the cost basis is typically the giver's original cost basis in the asset. However, if the giver paid gift taxes on the transfer, the recipient may be allowed to step up their cost basis by a proportion of the gift taxes paid. This is done to avoid double taxation on the same asset. 3. Community Property: Some states follow community property laws, under which assets acquired during a marriage are considered jointly owned. In community property states, when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse receives a step-up in cost basis for their share of the community property to its fair market value as of the date of the first spouse's death. 4. Replacement Property: If a taxpayer sells an asset and uses the proceeds to purchase a similar or related asset, they may defer recognizing any gain on the sale under certain circumstances. This is called a like-kind exchange or a Section 1031 exchange. The replacement property assumes the cost basis of the sold property (with some adjustments), but if the taxpayer eventually sells the replacement property, they will recognize any deferred gains at that time. 5. Property Improvements: If the owner of an asset, such as real estate, makes significant permanent improvements to the property that increase its value, the cost of those improvements may step up the cost basis. This can reduce future capital gains tax owed when the property is sold. 6. Stock Splits and Mergers: If a company undergoes a stock split, reverse stock split, or merger, the cost basis of the stocks may need to be adjusted accordingly. Although these events do not automatically result in a step-up in cost basis, they can change the cost basis per share to reflect new allocation and valuation. 7. Corporate Actions: Certain corporate actions, such as a spin-off or stock dividend, may also result in an adjustment to the cost basis of the shares involved. A step-up in cost basis can have significant tax implications for individuals who own or inherit assets. The step-up rules can prevent double taxation and may help reduce the amount of capital gains tax owed when the assets are sold by the new owner. It is essential to keep good records of cost basis information and consult a tax professional to ensure accurate tax reporting and compliance with tax laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this movie rated a 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland turns in a fabulous job as Oliver's father. But the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings, at least, not for me. I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal -- I still haven't seen Barry Lyndon -- because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The lone exception is What's Up, Doc?, in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist -- and, not coincidentally, he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure! McGraw and O'Neal tend to mug their lines, rather than act them. This movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career: it was Tommy Lee Jones's first movie.

It is further suggested that there might be changes in all parts of the team, including the potential signing of a more conventional centre forward and the departure of some players. The mention of particular players like Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez could imply they might be leaving the club. Here's a suggested continuation based on that: \\"Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez could be two players set to leave under Enrique's leadership. Coming changes might lead to a massive restructuring of the team, potentially changing the roles of player or even resulting in their transfer to other clubs.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What does the normal diet become?

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every even number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no even numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list. Problem:[[-47, -33, -47, -43], [17, 21, -14, 32], [9, -47], [38, -26, -2, -18, 42], [28, -13, -26, 15, 35], [-9, 46, 34, 41], [-9, 34, 38], [-40, -1, -5]] Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Recognize the input and its structure. Usage: The input is given as a list of lists of integers. Example: [[-47, -33, -47, -43], [17, 21, -14, 32], [9, -47], [38, -26, -2, -18, 42], [28, -13, -26, 15, 35], [-9, 46, 34, 41], [-9, 34, 38], [-40, -1, -5]]. Here, we have a total of 8 inner lists with varying lengths, containing both negative and positive integers. Part #2: Multiply even numbers in each inner list. Usage: For each inner list, multiply the even numbers together. Example: In the inner list [17, 21, -14, 32], the even numbers are -14 and 32. So the multiplication would be -14 * 32 = -448. Part #3: Handle cases with no even numbers in an inner list. Usage: If an inner list does not have any even numbers, output 0 for that list. Example: In the inner list [9, -47], there are no even numbers, so the output should be 0. Part #4: Create a list of results with the same length as the number of input inner lists. Usage: For each inner list, store the multiplication result in a new list. Example: For the given problem, we get the following results [-1, -448, 0, -392556, -728, 1574, 1292, 40]. This result list has a total of 8 elements, which is the same length as the input list. Part #5: Output a list of integers as the final result. Usage: The output should be a list of integers representing the multiplication of even numbers in each inner list. Example: For the given problem, we get the following output: [-1, -448, 0, -392556, -728, 1574, 1292, 40]. This list corresponds to the even number multiplications for each inner list, with 0s where no even numbers were found."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The task was quite simple and straightforward. All I needed to do was combine the words end to end, without leaving any gaps. As a result, we get a long string of characters, which can be a little harder to read than the original sentence. That being said, it is still possible to make out the individual words if you read the text carefully. The capitalization of the initial character in some words, such as \\"Ohdear!\\" and \\"saidtheman,\\" can also help make the text slightly more readable.

The Dolphins were hoping to rebound by playing an AFC East bout with the visiting Buffalo Bills in their Week 2 home-opener. Unfortunately, from the start, the Dolphins were unable to get anything going, as the Bills' Rian Lindell kicked a 33-yard field goal in the first quarter, while Buffalo's defense prevented Miami from getting any points throughout the first half. In the third quarter, things only got worse, as opposing QB J. P. Losman threw a 4-yard TD pass to opposing WR Josh Reed, while Lindell booted two field goals (45 & 43-yarders). The Dolphins finally managed to get some points as WR Chris Chambers caught a 23-yard TD pass, but Miami failed on the two-point conversion. What made this loss even more frustrating was that Dolphins QB Daunte Culpepper got sacked seven times and fumbled twice, making Miami wonder if acquiring Culpepper was the right idea in the first place.

It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service.

Q:Information: - A mountain bike or mountain bicycle (abbreviated Mtn Bike, MTB; or ATB, for all-terrain bicycle) is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction. - Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline. Unlike the other alpine skiing events, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined, which emphasize turning and technique, downhill is more about speed. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed. - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. - George David Atherton , known as Gee Atherton ( born 26 February 1985 , near Salisbury , England ) is a professional racing cyclist specialising in downhill and four cross mountain bike racing , and is a multiple national champion , multiple World Cup winner , 2010 Downhill World Cup Champion , and 2010 & 2014 Downhill World Champion . - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games). - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. - Mountain bike racing (shortened MTB or ATB racing) is a competitive cycle sport held on off-road terrain. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) recognised the discipline relatively late in 1990, when it sanctioned the world championships in Durango, Colorado. The first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup series took place in 1988. Its nine-race circuit covered two continentsEurope and North Americaand was sponsored by Grundig. Cross-country racing was the only World Cup sport at this time. In 1993, a six-event downhill World Cup was introduced. In 1996, cross-country mountain biking events were added to the Olympic Games. In 2006, cross-country mountain biking events became part of the World Deaf Cycling Championships for the first time in San Francisco, USA.

Make this lower case","completion":"The phrase \\"Suitable for all hair types, can be eliminated with a few brush strokes.\\" when converted to lower case would read as \\"suitable for all hair types, can be eliminated with a few brush strokes.\\" Lower case letters, also known as small letters or minuscules, provide an important contrast to upper case or majuscule letters in written language and aid in reading comprehension. Text in all upper case characters can often be interpreted as shouting when used in digital communication, hence the use of lower case letters is generally preferable in most text communication for providing a more friendly sense of communication. In computer systems, the conversion to lower or upper case letters is done in a couple of ways. One common method is using a function to convert the text, where the function runs through each letter in the string of text, checks if it's in upper case, and if so, converts it to lower case. This can be seen with functions like \\"toLowerCase()\\" in JavaScript or \\"lower()\\" in Python which are built-in functions designed to convert all the characters in a string to lower case letters. To keep the text clean and less aggressive, the lower case format is usually used unless necessary to emphasize a point. Many style guides prefer sentence case where the first letter of the first word and any proper nouns are capitalized, the rest of the text is in lower case. Usually, if you want to change your text from uppercase or mixed case to lowercase on a computer or in a word processing program, you select the text and choose the option to change the case. This may be called something like \\"Change Case,\\" \\"Text Case,\\" or \\"Convert Case\\" in different software programs. It's essential to ensure a balance between lower case and upper case in text for its requirements of formal or informal use. The use of all lower case letters can sometimes lead to a lack of clarity, especially when it involves proper nouns that should be capitalized. Still, it often suits better for writing that's meant to be down-to-earth and unassuming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They \\"reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives.\\" In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. In French lodges, for example, the line \\"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\\" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\"initiate the unenlightened\\". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there.

Though some believe a muzzle to be inhumane, many trainers regard it as a suitable tool for a suitable purpose, just like a dog collar or a leash. If you have trouble with your dog pursuing chickens with the intent to kill or eat them, a muzzle will make training safest for all of your animals. If your dog is especially excitable, you may want to keep him on a leash until he becomes calmer around your birds. Take him with you on your feeding chores to help him become even more accustomed to the chickens and the chickens more accustomed to him. Exercise simple commands like the compound sit-stay. You may want to practice this while entering the chicken coop to fetch your eggs, which has the added benefit of teaching your dog not to invade the boundary of the chicken coop. You can do this by rubbing down your chickens with damp cloth and putting that cloth in your dog's bed or pen. Dogs have a powerful sense of smell, so the scent of the chickens, when unfamiliar, can cause a strong reaction. While outside with your dog, you may see your chickens and/or roosters fighting. This is not especially uncommon, but can leave a valuable member of your egg laying team out of commission. With your dog on its lead, run towards the fighting animals and break up the scuffle. Once you have pulled the birds apart, practice one of your basic commands, or, if you've trained your dog in it, use the safe command. By showing your dog what to do in the event of a chicken fight, and rewarding him for helping you break it up, you will begin to teach him to run to help whenever he hears a chicken in distress. Your dog already has a keen sense of some wildlife predators, but crows and chicken hawks can be just as dangerous to younger birds and chicks as a fox. Together with your dog on his lead, shoo away crows or any other birds of prey. After you have successfully chased away the birds, praise your dog and feed him a treat. This will positively reinforce the behavior to protect chickens from birds of prey. As your dog becomes more trustworthy and proves he understands your commands and also your expectations of how he should act around your birds, you should allow him to patrol for critters. Thanks to your training in how to break up a chicken fight, he will race to the sound of a chicken in distress and help. You can't expect your canine companion to keep the chickens in line if he's out of shape. Go for regular walks, continue short, rapid fire training sessions, and show your dog he's a beloved part of your pack. Summary:","completion":"This article talks about training your dog to protect and take care of chickens, by getting them used to each other's scent, teaching simple commands, and rewarding good behavior to help keep the chickens safe from both fights among themselves and other dangers like birds of prey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Remove the fins, tale, sautés (bony plates), innards and bones with a knife and your fingers. Can we draw the following conclusion? Sturgeon with damaged flesh are not preferred.","completion":"Yes, it can be concluded that sturgeon with damaged flesh are not preferred when it comes to smoking the fish. Damaged flesh may negatively impact the taste, texture, and overall quality of the smoked sturgeon. To ensure the best possible end result, using fresh sturgeon that has been kept clean and cold is highly recommended. Here's a more detailed explanation and description of the steps involved in smoking sturgeon: 1. Preparation: - Acquire fresh sturgeon that has been properly stored in a cold environment - Make sure the flesh of the sturgeon is free from any damage 2. Cleaning: - Remove the fins, tail, and scutes (bony plates covering the fish) with a sharp filleting knife - Cut open the sturgeon and remove the innards and bones, being careful not to damage the surrounding flesh - Rinse the sturgeon under cold water, making sure to clean all surfaces thoroughly 3. Brining: - In a large container, prepare a brine solution (a mixture of water, salt, and sugar) according to your preferred brining recipe - Place the cleaned sturgeon in the brine mixture, ensuring it is fully submerged - Cover the container and let the sturgeon sit in the brine in the refrigerator for 8-16 hours, depending on the size of the sturgeon and the recipe you're following 4. Drying: - Remove the sturgeon from the brine and pat it dry with clean paper towels - Place the sturgeon on a wire rack and allow air to circulate around it - Allow the sturgeon to dry completely, usually for 2-4 hours, to form a pellicle (a thin layer of proteins) on its surface 5. Smoking: - Preheat your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions, targeting a temperature around 200-225°F (93-107°C) - Add wood chips or pellets, depending on the type of smoker you're using, to create the desired smoke levels - Place the sturgeon on the smoker rack and close the smoker lid - Maintain the smoker temperature and smoke levels throughout the process - Smoke the sturgeon for about 2-4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 140-150°F (60-66°C). This may vary depending on the thickness of the sturgeon and the desired level of smokiness. 6. Cooling and Storing: - Remove the smoked sturgeon from the smoker and let it cool to room temperature - Once cooled, refrigerate the smoked sturgeon in an airtight container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or foil - For the best taste and texture, consume the smoked sturgeon within 5-7 days of smoking, or freeze it for longer-term storage In conclusion, ensure you use good-quality, fresh sturgeon with no damaged flesh to achieve the best results when smoking sturgeon. Proper preparation, cleaning, and the smoking process are all essential to producing deliciously smoked sturgeon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I'm a big fan of fan of film noir, and this film by Otto Preminger easily stands as one of the best that I've seen! Preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit 'Laura' - Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, for an entirely different sort of crime film. Laura was based around love, and this film is based around hate; as we watch police detective Mark Dixon, a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics, accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal; a man by the name of Tommy Scalisi. The plot is brilliantly worked, and Preminger excellently balances several plot points; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character. The fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from, and director Otto Preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling, beating one another (and their women), shooting and more - and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier 'Laura', which was very much set in upper class society. The role of Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career. Here, we have a character that is difficult to like as he's so cold - but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he's easy to sympathise with, and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight. The character development is well timed, and as we've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film; everything makes sense by the end. His co-star is the beautiful Gene Tierney, who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in Laura; a film that made Tierney its linchpin. She does well with what she's got, however, and the lead duo's chemistry is excellent and Tierney helps to complete every scene she's in. I can't say that this is a better film than the earlier Laura; that's a hard act to follow, but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than Preminger's earlier film. The film also makes a good comparison piece for Laura; as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie, yet it's all strangely familiar. Highly recommended to all!

A:","completion":"After immediately purchasing the birthday present once it went on sale, Robin would likely experience a range of emotions and feelings. The exact emotions would depend on various elements, such as her relationship with the birthday person, the nature of the present, and her personal values and beliefs. However, some possible emotions and feelings that Robin might experience are as follows: 1. Satisfaction: Robin may feel satisfied and content for securing the birthday present right when it went on sale. This satisfaction may come from knowing she managed to buy the gift promptly, ensuring its availability, and possibly even taking advantage of a discounted price. Furthermore, knowing she has shown consideration and thoughtfulness in selecting the gift can boost her happiness and satisfaction. 2. Relief: Purchasing the present immediately after its release can provide a sense of relief to Robin. This is because she no longer needs to worry about the gift's availability or competing with others interested in purchasing the same item. Additionally, she can now focus on other preparations or tasks related to the birthday celebration without the stress of finding the perfect gift. 3. Excitement: Robin might be excited about giving the birthday present to the recipient. This excitement may stem from the anticipation of seeing the recipient's reaction to the gift, particularly if she believes they will genuinely love or appreciate the present. The excitement can also come from imagining the recipient using or enjoying the gift, which can increase Robin's sense of happiness and well-being. 4. Curiosity: After purchasing the birthday present, Robin may experience curiosity about how the actual gift will be received and if it meets the expectations of the birthday person. She might wonder whether the recipient will like the present as much as she thinks they will and what their overall response will be. 5. Pride: If Robin managed to find a truly unique or fitting gift for the birthday person, she might feel a sense of pride in her choice. This pride may come from knowing that she made an effort to select a gift that demonstrates her understanding of the recipient's preferences, needs, and interests. In turn, this pride may increase her self-esteem and self-worth. 6. Anticipation: Finally, Robin may feel anticipation and eagerness leading up to the moment when she will give the birthday present. She might be looking forward to the celebration, enjoying the company of friends and loved ones, and experiencing the pleasure of sharing in the recipient's joy as they unwrap their gift. Of course, the intensity and combination of these emotions would vary depending on Robin's character, the specific context, and personal circumstances. But in general, after purchasing the birthday present, Robin would likely experience a blend of satisfaction, relief, excitement, curiosity, pride, and anticipation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN)Mitt Romney told an audience of Republican donors in New York on Friday that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid. \\"Mitt told the group of 30 or so guys that were there that he is considering a run for the White House and that they could go tell their friends,\\" a source in the room told CNN. The Wall Street Journal first reported the comments. Though his loyalists and supportive donors have floated his name as a potential candidate for the better part of a year, Romney himself has been more reticent about mounting another White House bid after his 2008 and 2012 losses. But Romney's outlook has changed in recent weeks, according to people who have spoken with him recently, and he seems to be more serious than ever before. Romney has kept in close touch with his donors, many of whom have become close friends over two presidential cycles, according to one source close to Romney who was not at the meeting in New York but is familiar with his thinking. Romney hosts an annual retreat each year in Park City for policy discussions—and used the two most recent gatherings in 2013 and 2014 to introduce them to potential 2016 presidential candidates including Rand Paul and Chris Christie. (Jeb Bush was invited to speak last summer, but could not attend because of previous commitments, including his father's birthday). Many of Romney's New York donors, who are in frequent touch with him, had suggested a lunch or get-together when Romney was in New York, which resulted in the meeting with donors on Friday as he was on his way back from Charlie Baker's swearing in as the new governor of Massachusetts, this person said. Former aides to Romney have said that his thinking about the race has evolved over several months, particularly after he had time to reflect on being back on the campaign trail for the midterm races. As former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has moved toward a bid, many donors had pressed him for a signal about his level of interest. \\"He had not closed his mind on this, and today was the day that he decided to share that with the group of people he was with,\\" the source familiar with Romney's thinking said. \\"His conviction that the country is on the wrong track is very strong. He's very concerned with America's role in the world. Nothing has changed on that.\\" As far as re-entering the field for the Republican nomination, the source said, \\"He knows he would have to earn it, he knows no one is handed the nomination, but he's giving it some thought....His head hasn't changed, I think he was just formalizing it a little bit,\\" at the Friday meeting, the source said, to let donors know he was considering a bid more seriously. Romney's comments come in the wake of Jeb Bush's stepped-up political activity. Bush, Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — all favorites of the Republican establishment and New York donor community — would presumably draw from the same pool of financial backers. \\"I think he is serious,\\" said the person at the New York meeting. \\"One of the first things he said he said was, 'People ask me, do you want to be president? Well, yes, I did run twice.\\" Romney said that his wife, Ann, is \\"very encouraging\\" about 2016, the source said, but his sons are split about the idea, the source who was in the room said. The source familiar with Romney's thinking also said Ann is \\"supportive of it\\" if that's what Romney wants. \\"I don't think he would have come to this without talking to his family.\\" At the heart of this, this source adds, is that \\"the state of the country hasn't settled for him. he won't be happy sitting on the sidelines.\\" The former Massachusetts governor told the crowd that a potential campaign would \\"have to have a positive message.\\" He also said, somewhat obviously, that he \\"would run a different campaign from what he's run in the past.\\" Romney entertained questions about the rest of the potential 2016 field but had only positive things to say about his would-be rivals, the source said. The news comes after a week chock-full of high-profile potential Republican presidential candidates taking the first steps toward announcing their candidacy for the 2016 election. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched a Leadership PAC this week, just days after resigning his position on various corporate and nonprofite boards. And former GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee quit his show on Fox News last week to give 2016 some serious consideration. And CNN reported Wednesday that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is assembling a team for a potential 2016 presidential bid. The revelation of Romney's overtures to top GOP donors is yet another addition to the long-term game of footsy Romney has played with the media and other Republicans who would like to know whether Romney is in or out -- though it's certainly the most definitive and serious indication that Romney might actually launch a third presidential bid. Romney was rumored to be through with his presidential ambitions after a grueling 2012 run, but this summer he made several head nods that he was considering. Romney told the Washington Post this summer that \\"we'll have to see what happens\\" and said in another interview that the chances were very slim -- but conceded there was nonetheless always a chance. \\"We never say never,\\" Ann Romney said on CNN's \\"New Day\\" this summer. Gloria Borger contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Mitt Romney has expressed to a group of Republican donors in New York that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid.

What is the advantage of taping off places ?","completion":"Taping off places that need to be protected during painting or staining projects is a crucial step to ensure a clean, professional outcome. This technique typically involves applying painter's tape or masking tape around edges, borders, and other areas you wish to shield from accidental paint or stain marks. The advantages of taping off places are numerous and contribute to the overall quality and appearance of the finished project. Some of these advantages include: 1. Precision: Taping off places creates a sharp, well-defined boundary between different surfaces or colors, achieving a professional and polished look. It allows for clean and straight lines, particularly when working with contrasting shades, and avoids paint or stain seeping onto unintended surfaces. 2. Protection: It serves as a barrier, shielding areas like doorframes, baseboards, window sills, and other architectural details from unwanted paint spills, drips, and brush strokes. This prevents irreversible damage to these surfaces and saves both time and effort in the clean-up process. 3. Consistent results: Taping off places ensures that you maintain a consistent finish throughout the project. It aids in achieving a uniform edge with even thickness, which is difficult to achieve without this protective barrier in place. 4. Time-saving: While it may seem like an additional step in the painting or staining process, taping off places saves you time and effort in the long run. It reduces the need for touch-ups caused by paint or stain bleeding and minimizes clean up after you complete your project. 5. Enhances overall appearance: A neatly taped-off area sets the stage for a flawless and visually appealing result. It adds finesse and attention to detail that elevates the quality of your work, making a significant difference in the final appearance. 6. Eases color transitions: When working with multiple colors or painting a feature wall, taping off places allows for seamless and smooth transitions between different shades. It ensures the colors don't bleed into one another, improving the overall visual impact. 7. Simplifies the painting process: For novice painters or DIY-enthusiasts, taping off places simplifies the process by offering a guideline to follow and a safety net for any stray brush strokes. It helps avoid unintentional mistakes, boosting your confidence in tackling painting projects. In summary, taping off places offers a multitude of advantages that contribute to a cleaner, more precise, and professional-looking result in painting or staining projects. It not only simplifies the process but also ensures a consistent and visually appealing outcome, protecting delicate surfaces and making color transitions seamless."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How many years after Portugal declared bankruptcy was the monarchy deposed elements of the armed forces\\" is \\"92\\"?","completion":"Yes, the correct answer is 18 years. Portugal declared bankruptcy in 1892, and the monarchy was deposed in 1910 by elements of the armed forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I read this background article the other day: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. I am facing a new situation today: Two villages had many inhabitants practicing horticulture. People from Valley village grew flowers and used arthropodes and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Granite village used arthropods and snails, they cultivated them for food. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village knew more about bee pollination? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question of which village knew more about bee pollination, let's analyze the information provided and compare the two villages: 1. Valley Village: - They grew flowers. - They used arthropods and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Given that they rely on arthropods and other insects for pollination, it's likely that the inhabitants of Valley village have an understanding of bee pollination, as they recognize the importance of these pollinators in their horticulture practices. 2. Granite Village: - They used arthropods and snails. - They cultivated them for food. Although they also interact with arthropods, the purpose is different. Granite village cultivates arthropods and snails for food, which does not necessarily indicate knowledge of bee pollination, especially since pollination is not mentioned in their practices. Comparing the two villages, it seems that Valley village has a more direct connection to bee pollination due to their reliance on arthropods and other insects for pollination in their horticultural practices. Therefore, I would conclude that Valley village probably knows more about bee pollination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the below context: Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...

He and his wife, Lindsey, became first-time parents to Isla Quinn. “She’s gorgeous!” he gushed to me the other day. So what’s the big deal, you might ask? Millions of men become fathers every year. Ah, but this new dad has let the love for his daughter inspire a revolution. A kindness revolution. “I was sitting on my couch at the end of the year,” he remembers, “thinking about New Year’s resolutions. Should I try to lose weight? Do something else predictable?” He looked over at his sweet baby girl and inspiration hit him. “I decided I wanted to do something that would inspire her in the future. I wanted to be a better person.” That’s how 2012 became his year of random acts of kindness. Each day for this calendar year, he’s committed to doing something nice for someone else. Sometimes, it’s for people he knows. “I tracked down my sixth-grade teacher, Mr. Plecas,” he said, “and wrote him a letter thanking him for being my favorite teacher ever. He had a way of making learning fun. I’ll never forget him, and he needed to know that.” Ryan has also sent a letter to a family who lost their son while he was serving in Afghanistan. “I wanted to send my condolences and thank them for everything their family has sacrificed, he explained. There have been funny days, too. Like the time he made a point to compliment 25 total strangers. That was as great as the day he stood on the corner and offered free hugs. If it sounds like quite the journey, it is. Ryan is sharing his kind acts with the world on this blog, 366randomacts.org (online at 366randomacts.org). He invites you to follow along. You can also find him on Facebook and Twitter. In fact, for every “like” and “follower” he gets, he’s donating a dime to charity. This giving thing has a way of growing. Ryan figures it’s the least he can do. “I never meant to do any of this for me,” he says. “I just can’t believe how much I’m getting out of it. The little bit of kindness I put out seems to multiply the way it comes back to me.” “And what about Baby Isla?” I ask. “She’s too young to appreciate her dad doing any of this.” “That’s the main reason I’m doing the blog,” he says. “When she’s old enough, she’ll see all the stories, photos and videos. She’ll see how she inspired one man to become a better person.” This kindness streak is such a fun ride, Ryan is suggesting you try it out for yourself. “You know what people will say to that,” I offer, “it’s nice for this guy, but I’m way too busy to fit all this in.” “No one is busier than I am,” he counters. “I’ve got a newborn, a demanding full-time job, groups I belong to, and I work out. I’ve found out that being nice doesn’t take extra time.” So are you in? If your ride is anything like Ryan’s, sounds like putting a little kindness out there will take you places you never imagined.

Write a question about the following article: In the 1660s and early 1670s, the Swedish Empire experienced a financial crisis. In hope of subsidies, Charles XI of Sweden had entered the anti-French Triple Alliance with the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, which broke apart when Charles II of England rapproached France in 1670, after the War of Devolution. In April 1672, Sweden and France concluded an alliance, with France promising 400,000 riksdalers of subsidies in peace time, to be raised to 600,000 in war time, for Sweden maintaining a 16,000 men strong army in her German dominions. Also, Sweden maintained good relations to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp south of Denmark. By September 1674, Sweden had enlarged her army to 22,000 men after France had increased the subsidies to 900,000 riksdalers, which she threatened to withdraw if Sweden was not using this army, stationed in Swedish Pomerania, for an attack on her adversaries. By December, the Swedish army had grown to 25,000 to 26,000 men, 4,000 to 5,000 of whom stationed in Bremen, 2,000 to 3,000 in Wismar, 6,000 to 7,000 in Pomeranian garrisons, and 13,000 free to operate under Lord High Constable and field marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer the questions at the end based on the text. One of the most famous people born in Warsaw was Maria Skłodowska-Curie, who achieved international recognition for her research on radioactivity and was the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize. Famous musicians include Władysław Szpilman and Frédéric Chopin. Though Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, about 60 km (37 mi) from Warsaw, he moved to the city with his family when he was seven months old. Casimir Pulaski, a Polish general and hero of the American Revolutionary War, was born here in 1745. The Saxon Garden, covering the area of 15.5 ha, was formally a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The Łazienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilanów Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Ensuring you are eating a balanced diet at regular intervals throughout the day can help prevent or reduce the pain associated with your period. A well-balanced diet includes whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruit. Foods that are rich in complex carbohydrates can also be helpful as they help your body produce more serotonin, which in turn helps to regulate your mood and symptoms. Additional foods to consider are: nuts and seeds, almonds, buckwheat, millet, oats, sesame and sunflower seeds, blackstrap molasses, grapes and red beets. In addition to eating the proper foods, you may want to try eating six smaller meals throughout the day, instead of three larger ones. Spreading out your food intake can help keep your blood sugar levels balanced, which in turn can help alleviate many symptoms associated with your period, including pain and cramps. When cooking, using healthy oils like vegetable or olive oil. Glycemic load is based on the glycemic index. The glycemic index is used to rank foods based on how quickly they work their way through your digestive system and how quickly they get absorbed into your bloodstream. Eating foods with a low glycemic load means they take longer to work their way through your digestive system and do not cause spikes in your blood sugar levels. Examples of food with a low glycemic load include: whole grain bread, apples, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, watermelons, carrots, lentils, peas, and soybeans. Examples of food with a high glycemic load include: white bagels, cornflakes, baked potatoes, and sweet potatoes. You can find more information and search where specific foods fall on the glycemic index at this website: http://www.glycemicindex.com/ Foods that contain large amounts of fat, along with highly processed foods, should be avoided. In addition, it is also helpful to reduce the amount of sodium you consume. Foods that contain all of these items can make the pain associated with your period (and other PMS symptoms) worse. It is also best to eliminate the intake of any foods that contain trans-fats. Trans-fats are normally found in commercially produced foods such as: cookies, crackers, cakes, french fries, onion rings, donuts, and margarine. In the days leading up to your period, you should try to reduce the amount of alcohol you consume. Alcohol has the ability to make the pain associated with your period (and other PMS symptoms) worse. Beverages and foods containing caffeine can worsen cramps and bloating. Caffeine can cause blood vessels to constrict and cramp more than they do in those who avoid caffeine. Cut out coffee and caffeinated tea the week before your period. Sometimes the pain associated with a woman’s period, including many of the symptoms associated with PMS, can be made worse by stress, anxiety and overall tension in the body. Implementing techniques to help you relax and relieve stress can help reduce or eliminate your painful symptoms. Relaxation techniques can include: breathing exercises, meditation and yoga. Attending a yoga class via a local yoga studio or recreation centre can also help you learn proper breathing methods and meditation techniques. Massage is another great way to help reduce tension and increase relaxation. Scheduling a regular massage right before or during your period every month may help you manage the pain. There is an acupressure point located on the inside of your leg, approximately three finger widths up from your anklebone, that can create relief for cramps and pain caused by your period. Use your fingers to apply deep pressure to this area for five minutes to help relieve the pain. Applying pressure and massaging your lower abdomen, where the cramps are most painful, may also help. You might want to try this in combination with a heating pad. The change in hormone levels just before your period can often cause severe headaches and even migraines. One way to help relieve the pain caused by these headaches is to apply a cold cloth or ice pack to your head or neck — wherever the pain is most prominent. If you decide to use an ice pack, or ice cubes, be sure to wrap it in a towel first. Avoid applying ice-cold items directly to your skin, as this can cause irritation or damage. Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but it can also help relieve cramps and other pain caused by your period. Two types of exercise that are most effective is yoga and aerobic exercises. Try to exercise for 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week. A warm bath (or shower) or a heating pad can help reduce the severity of the cramps caused by your period. The heating pad can be placed on your belly, below your belly button. Be careful not to fall asleep with a heating pad on. If possible, purchase a heating pad that automatically turns itself off after a certain period of time. Summary:","completion":"To prevent or reduce period pain, maintain a balanced diet with whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and complex carbohydrates, while consuming six smaller meals throughout the day. Focus on low glycemic load foods and avoid high-fat and processed foods, reducing sodium and trans-fat intake. Minimize alcohol and caffeine consumption before your period. Manage stress and anxiety through relaxation techniques, yoga, and massage. Apply acupressure and massage to relieve cramps, use a cold cloth or ice pack for headaches, and engage in regular exercise. Finally, use heating pads or take warm baths to alleviate cramps, but be cautious with heating pad use while sleeping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

There's certainly nothing objectionable about Tully, but there's nothing remarkable either. It resides in that cinematic middle ground of not-bad, not-great, just okay. 3. A heartfelt, understated and occasionally heavy-handed slice of heartland. 4. It's a promising debut made even better by an impressive bunch of actors. 5. Flawed but promising. 6. Watching Tully reminded me of a time when calling a movie 'little' was a compliment, a way of saying a director had found ways to locate his movie in a world that seemed entirely real. 7. Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham. 8. Best to just pick up a blade of grass and chew on it while absorbing the scenic imagery and natural acting of a strong cast. 9. The movie resonates with a rare and genuine sweetness. 10.

Today, we are going to learn how to pronounce a new word by taking it apart and putting it back together. This will help us say it correctly and have fun while doing it! First, let's start by breaking the word into smaller parts. Like how we build with our favorite toy blocks, we can break words down into smaller pieces to make it easier for us to learn. So, we have a word that has two parts: \\"o-\\" and \\"-nee-.\\" Let's learn how to say these two parts first, and then we can put them back together like a puzzle. To pronounce the first part \\"o-\\", we should make a round shape with our mouth, like a little circle. Then, let the sound come through our mouth and it will sound like 'oh.' Now, let's move on to the second part: \\"-nee-.\\" For this part, you need to press your lips together gently and let the sound flow through your nose. It will sound like 'knee,' just like the part of your leg that bends when you walk. Great job! Now we are ready to add one more sound to complete our word. The sound we need to add is \\"sa.\\" To pronounce \\"sa,\\" we need to open our mouths a little bit and let the air flow smoothly while making a soft sound with an 's' and then an 'a.' It will sound like 'sah.' Now here comes the fun part, let's put it all together! Like putting pieces of a puzzle together, we need to connect the first part \\"o-\\", the second part \\"-nee-,\\" and our final sound, \\"sa.\\" When we put them together, we get the word \\"o-nee-sa.\\" Congratulations, you just learned how to pronounce a new word! Keep practicing this word and other new words by breaking them down into smaller parts and putting them back together. This way, you will become a super word builder, and soon, you'll be able to read, speak, and understand so many more words. Now grab your favorite book and practice some more words with your family or friends - happy learning!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 538 BCE, Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon and took over its empire.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Whether you admit it or not, music improves our daily life and makes us feel easy, especially the music of Beethoven and Mozart. But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior? The head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos. Mr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \\"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\\". Mr. Walker said this was unacceptable, because it was making the rest of the students fail to focus their attention on their study. Mr. Walker believes what he does reminds students that education is something to value. \\"It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will improve their life chances,\\" he said. The head teacher thinks students in fact learn from being kept behind after school. \\"Hopefully, I open their ears to an experience they don't normally have and don't want to have again, so it's both educational and acts as a warning.\\" Music has had success elsewhere in reducing bad behavior. In 2004, it reduced crime on London's subway by 25 percent. Researchers from a Belfast university found it helped stop elephants' bad behavior.

As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through.

Possible A: open eyes, wear glasses, go to movies, have eyes, relax Why is \\"open eyes\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Open eyes\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it involves the most basic and essential step for watching a film. By having our eyes open, we can see the visuals displayed on the screen, which is a fundamental aspect of watching a film. The other options also have some relevance, but they are either secondary or not directly related to the actual act of watching the film on our faces. For example, wearing glasses may be necessary for those with vision problems, but it is not universally applicable or essential; going to the movies relates more to the location rather than what we do on our faces; having eyes is a prerequisite for seeing, but it doesn't specify the action; and relaxing is more about our mental state.

Answer:","completion":"The real name of the criminal known as 'The Monster of Dusseldorf' was Peter Kürten. Born on May 26, 1883, in Mülheim am Rhein, Germany, Peter Kürten was a notorious serial killer and rapist who terrorized the city of Dusseldorf during the 1920s and 1930s. Kürten grew up in an impoverished, abusive household, which is believed to have greatly influenced his deviant and violent behavior later in life. As a child, he was subjected to the violent tendencies of his father, who routinely abused his wife and children. This harsh upbringing likely contributed to Kürten's violent tendencies and sadistic nature that would later define him as 'The Monster of Dusseldorf.' His first recorded criminal activity began at a young age, with various petty crimes and acts of animal abuse. Soon after, his pattern of criminality escalated, and he moved on to more violent and gruesome acts such as arson, burglary, theft, and vandalism. As Kürten grew older, his criminal offenses evolved into a series of shocking murders, sexual assaults, and vicious attacks. His main motivation behind these crimes was not only the fulfillment of his own sadistic desires but also the infliction of extreme pain and suffering on his victims. Kürten committed most of his murders during 1929, and his victims ranged from women to young girls and even men. He used various methods to kill, including strangulation, stabbing, and bludgeoning. Oftentimes, Kürten would sexually assault his victims before or after the act of murder, further showcasing his deviant and sadistic nature. He earned the nickname 'The Monster of Dusseldorf' due to the terror he instilled in the city of Dusseldorf, as well as the brutality of his crimes. His choice of victims and the violent nature of his crimes made it difficult for the police to apprehend him, as there seemed to be no specific pattern to his crimes. However, Kürten ultimately confessed many of his crimes to his wife, who, in turn, reported him to the authorities. He was arrested on May 24, 1930. During his trial, Peter Kürten showed no remorse and provided chilling details about his crimes. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by beheading. On July 2, 1931, Kürten was executed by guillotine in Cologne, Germany. 'The Monster of Dusseldorf' will forever be remembered as one of Germany's most notorious and terrifying serial killers."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN)The attack is harrowing: Al-Shabaab militants raid a quarry in Kenya, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them. The brutal act comes just days after the Islamists ambushed a bus and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses. The attacks reminded the world once again how brazen the group can be. What does Al-Shabaab want? Here's an explainer. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008. It wants to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2011, after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya blamed on Al-Shabaab, the OPTIONS: - Al-Shabaab government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - CNN government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Council on Foreign Relations government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Islamic government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Islamists government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Kenya government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Muslim government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Quran government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Sharia government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Somali government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - Somalia government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - U.S. government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - United States government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - al-Qaeda government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. - non-Muslim government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia.","completion":"Answer: - Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. Explanation: The correct answer should be the \\"Kenyan government\\" because the sentence before the gap tells us about attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya blamed on Al-Shabaab. It implies that the government of Kenya would respond to these attacks. The other options are not logical. For example, Al-Shabaab is a terrorist group and does not govern, CNN and the Council on Foreign Relations are news organizations, not governments. The U.S. or the United States government was not mentioned in this context, and Somalia would not likely order an incursion into its own territory.

Information: - Lad tiden gå ( English : Let time pass ) is a 1986 science fiction novel by Danish modernist writer Svend Aage Madsen . The novel focuses on one of the central themes in Madsen 's writing - the nature of time . Like most of Madsen 's novels it has n't been published in English . This novel is a typical example of the third phase in Madsen 's writing that 's like most of his later works is set in the town of Aarhus and has several characters that also appear in his other books ( Johanna , Sverre ) . It also has another typical feature of Madsen 's books - a complicated timeline of the novel having chapters describing overlapping periods of time . - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Svend Åge Madsen (born 2 November 1939) is a Danish novelist. He studied mathematics before he began writing fiction. His novels are generally philosophical and humorous. Several of his works have been made into films in Denmark. His writings are extensive and has been translated into many languages.

Choices: - ancient greece - denmark Answer:","completion":"The best answer for the entity that is related to 'let time pass' with the relationship of 'country of origin' is Denmark. Reasoning: this connection is made clear through the information outlined in the provided texts. 'Let time pass' (or 'Lad tiden gå' in Danish) is identified as a science fiction novel written by Svend Aage Madsen in 1986. The text specifies that Svend Aage Madsen is a modernist writer from Denmark. Hence, considering the 'country of origin' in the context of the novel 'Let time pass', Denmark is identified as the correct answer. This connection would not be Ancient Greece because, while Ancient Greece does play a role in the history of the development of language and has philosophers who debated about the origin of language, it doesn't have a direct relation to the novel 'Let time pass.' In summary, the Danish origin of the novel 'Let time pass' is evident through the Danish nationality of its author, Svend Aage Madsen. Therefore, Denmark is the 'country of origin' related to 'Let time pass.' This reasoning eliminates the option of Ancient Greece as the correct answer because it lacks a direct association with this novel, regardless of its considerable contribution to language development and philosophical discussions about language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

File photo The ashes of cremated Catholics cannot be kept at home, scattered or divided among family members, the Vatican has announced in new guidelines. The two-page instruction by the Vatican's department on doctrine said ashes of the dead must be kept in \\"sacred places\\" such as cemeteries. It also stressed that the Roman Catholic Church still preferred burials over cremations. The Vatican allowed cremation in 1963 but has always frowned on the practice. It also stressed at the time that cremation must not suggest a denial of faith about resurrection. Countering 'new ideas' \\"It is not permitted to scatter the ashes of the faithful departed in the air, on land, at sea or in some other way, nor may they be preserved in mementos, pieces of jewellery or other objects,\\" said the instruction by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. \\"These courses of action cannot be legitimised by an appeal to the sanitary, social, or economic motives that may have occasioned the choice of cremation.\\" The Vatican said it was issuing the new guidelines to counter \\"new ideas contrary to the Church's faith\\" that had become widespread since 1963. It said the Church could not \\"condone attitudes or permit rites that involve erroneous ideas about death, such as considering death as the definitive annihilation of the person, or the moment of fusion with Mother Nature or the universe, or as a stage in the cycle of regeneration, or as the definitive liberation from the 'prison' of the body\\". The guidelines reiterated that Catholics who chose to be cremated \\"for reasons contrary to the Christian faith\\" must be denied a Christian funeral. The Vatican also stressed that \\"the Church continues to prefer the practice of burying the bodies of the deceased, because this shows a greater esteem towards the deceased\\". Pope Francis had already approved the guidelines, the Vatican said. Shortage of burial land fears - BBC's Religious Affairs correspondent Martin Bashir Fearing the impact of naturalistic ideas about the circle of life, where the body is regarded as no different to other physical matter, the Vatican has decided to clarify its position on what should happen to the remains of the dead. Cardinal Gerhard Muller, the head of the Church's powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said ashes of those cremated should be committed to a cemetery or another consecrated place. But Britain and some other western countries face a shortage of land in which to bury bodies. There are concerns this announcement will not only place financial burdens on Catholic families but also increase the pressure on cemeteries, half of which are expected to run out of space within the next 20 years. ||||| CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH Instruction Ad resurgendum cum Christo regarding the burial of the deceased and the conservation of the ashes in the case of cremation 1. To rise with Christ, we must die with Christ: we must “be away from the body and at home with the Lord” (2 Cor 5:8). With the Instruction Piam et Constantem of 5 July 1963, the then Holy Office established that “all necessary measures must be taken to preserve the practice of reverently burying the faithful departed”, adding however that cremation is not “opposed per se to the Christian religion” and that no longer should the sacraments and funeral rites be denied to those who have asked that they be cremated, under the condition that this choice has not been made through “a denial of Christian dogmas, the animosity of a secret society, or hatred of the Catholic religion and the Church”.[1] Later this change in ecclesiastical discipline was incorporated into the Code of Canon Law (1983) and the Code of Canons of Oriental Churches (1990). During the intervening years, the practice of cremation has notably increased in many countries, but simultaneously new ideas contrary to the Church’s faith have also become widespread. Having consulted the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts and numerous Episcopal Conferences and Synods of Bishops of the Oriental Churches, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has deemed opportune the publication of a new Instruction, with the intention of underlining the doctrinal and pastoral reasons for the preference of the burial of the remains of the faithful and to set out norms pertaining to the conservation of ashes in the case of cremation. 2. The resurrection of Jesus is the culminating truth of the Christian faith, preached as an essential part of the Paschal Mystery from the very beginnings of Christianity: “For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures; that he was buried; that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures; that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve” (1 Cor 15:3-5). Through his death and resurrection, Christ freed us from sin and gave us access to a new life, “so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life” (Rm 6:4). Furthermore, the risen Christ is the principle and source of our future resurrection: “Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep […] For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Cor 15:20-22). It is true that Christ will raise us up on the last day; but it is also true that, in a certain way, we have already risen with Christ. In Baptism, actually, we are immersed in the death and resurrection of Christ and sacramentally assimilated to him: “You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead” (Col 2:12). United with Christ by Baptism, we already truly participate in the life of the risen Christ (cf. Eph 2:6). Because of Christ, Christian death has a positive meaning. The Christian vision of death receives privileged expression in the liturgy of the Church: “Indeed for your faithful, Lord, life is changed not ended, and, when this earthly dwelling turns to dust, an eternal dwelling is made ready for them in heaven”.[2] By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed by reunion with our soul. In our own day also, the Church is called to proclaim her faith in the resurrection: “The confidence of Christians is the resurrection of the dead; believing this we live”.[3] 3. Following the most ancient Christian tradition, the Church insistently recommends that the bodies of the deceased be buried in cemeteries or other sacred places.[4] In memory of the death, burial and resurrection of the Lord, the mystery that illumines the Christian meaning of death,[5] burial is above all the most fitting way to express faith and hope in the resurrection of the body.[6] The Church who, as Mother, has accompanied the Christian during his earthly pilgrimage, offers to the Father, in Christ, the child of her grace, and she commits to the earth, in hope, the seed of the body that will rise in glory.[7] By burying the bodies of the faithful, the Church confirms her faith in the resurrection of the body,[8] and intends to show the great dignity of the human body as an integral part of the human person whose body forms part of their identity.[9] She cannot, therefore, condone attitudes or permit rites that involve erroneous ideas about death, such as considering death as the definitive annihilation of the person, or the moment of fusion with Mother Nature or the universe, or as a stage in the cycle of regeneration, or as the definitive liberation from the “prison” of the body. Furthermore, burial in a cemetery or another sacred place adequately corresponds to the piety and respect owed to the bodies of the faithful departed who through Baptism have become temples of the Holy Spirit and in which “as instruments and vessels the Spirit has carried out so many good works”.[10] Tobias, the just, was praised for the merits he acquired in the sight of God for having buried the dead,[11] and the Church considers the burial of dead one of the corporal works of mercy.[12] Finally, the burial of the faithful departed in cemeteries or other sacred places encourages family members and the whole Christian community to pray for and remember the dead, while at the same time fostering the veneration of martyrs and saints. Through the practice of burying the dead in cemeteries, in churches or their environs, Christian tradition has upheld the relationship between the living and the dead and has opposed any tendency to minimize, or relegate to the purely private sphere, the event of death and the meaning it has for Christians. 4. In circumstances when cremation is chosen because of sanitary, economic or social considerations, this choice must never violate the explicitly-stated or the reasonably inferable wishes of the deceased faithful. The Church raises no doctrinal objections to this practice, since cremation of the deceased’s body does not affect his or her soul, nor does it prevent God, in his omnipotence, from raising up the deceased body to new life. Thus cremation, in and of itself, objectively negates neither the Christian doctrine of the soul’s immortality nor that of the resurrection of the body.[13] The Church continues to prefer the practice of burying the bodies of the deceased, because this shows a greater esteem towards the deceased. Nevertheless, cremation is not prohibited, “unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine”.[14] In the absence of motives contrary to Christian doctrine, the Church, after the celebration of the funeral rite, accompanies the choice of cremation, providing the relevant liturgical and pastoral directives, and taking particular care to avoid every form of scandal or the appearance of religious indifferentism. 5. When, for legitimate motives, cremation of the body has been chosen, the ashes of the faithful must be laid to rest in a sacred place, that is, in a cemetery or, in certain cases, in a church or an area, which has been set aside for this purpose, and so dedicated by the competent ecclesial authority. From the earliest times, Christians have desired that the faithful departed become the objects of the Christian community’s prayers and remembrance. Their tombs have become places of prayer, remembrance and reflection. The faithful departed remain part of the Church who believes “in the communion of all the faithful of Christ, those who are pilgrims on earth, the dead who are being purified, and the blessed in heaven, all together forming one Church”.[15] The reservation of the ashes of the departed in a sacred place ensures that they are not excluded from the prayers and remembrance of their family or the Christian community. It prevents the faithful departed from being forgotten, or their remains from being shown a lack of respect, which eventuality is possible, most especially once the immediately subsequent generation has too passed away. Also it prevents any unfitting or superstitious practices. 6. For the reasons given above, the conservation of the ashes of the departed in a domestic residence is not permitted. Only in grave and exceptional cases dependent on cultural conditions of a localized nature, may the Ordinary, in agreement with the Episcopal Conference or the Synod of Bishops of the Oriental Churches, concede permission for the conservation of the ashes of the departed in a domestic residence. Nonetheless, the ashes may not be divided among various family members and due respect must be maintained regarding the circumstances of such a conservation. 7. In order that every appearance of pantheism, naturalism or nihilism be avoided, it is not permitted to scatter the ashes of the faithful departed in the air, on land, at sea or in some other way, nor may they be preserved in mementos, pieces of jewelry or other objects. These courses of action cannot be legitimized by an appeal to the sanitary, social, or economic motives that may have occasioned the choice of cremation. 8. When the deceased notoriously has requested cremation and the scattering of their ashes for reasons contrary to the Christian faith, a Christian funeral must be denied to that person according to the norms of the law.[16] The Sovereign Pontiff Francis, in the Audience granted to the undersigned Cardinal Prefect on 18 March 2016, approved the present Instruction, adopted in the Ordinary Session of this Congregation on 2 March 2016, and ordered its publication.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.\\". Can you tell me what it is?
