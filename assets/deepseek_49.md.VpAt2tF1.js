Step 1: Understand the context and characters The given text seems to be part of a story in which the narrator is talking to a character named Ezra. The narrator seems to have some kind of training that Ezra is questioning. The conversation is happening near a mat, presumably for training purposes. The narrator has no prior training. Step 2: Progress the conversation Considering the context of the conversation, I will continue with the dialogue between the narrator and Ezra. I will explore Ezra's reaction to the revelation that the narrator has no prior training. Step 3: Introduce a conflict or challenge To make the story more engaging, I will introduce a conflict or challenge the characters are about to face together, which will eventually lead to the narrator receiving training from Ezra. Story continuation: mat. \\"Well, that explains a lot,\\" he said sarcastically, \\"But we don't have much time.

It could strike at any moment, and we need to be ready. That means you need to be ready.\\" I felt a sudden rush of nervousness. \\"But... I don't know anything about self-defense or combat.\\" Step 4: Introduce a resolution or plan To move the story forward, I will have Ezra devise a plan to train the narrator quickly and efficiently, incorporating the urgency of the situation and the need for teamwork. Ezra nodded, understanding the gravity of my inexperience. \\"I know, and that's why I'm here. We'll start with the basics and move on to more advanced techniques as you progress. But first, let's establish a few ground rules.\\" He began counting them off. \\"One, never give up. Persistence is key. Two, always trust your instincts. They'll often tell you when something is off. And three, we're in this together, so don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance.\\" With that, our intense training began. Ezra guided me through drills, sparring, and self-defense techniques that both challenged and pushed me to my limits. I struggled, but with Ezra's encouragement, I found myself slowly but surely improving.

Identify the key elements in both statements: Statement 1: - Man - White button-up shirt - Addressing a group of people Statement 2: - Man - White shirt - Addressing a group of people - On a training 2. Compare the elements: - Both mention a man. - In statement 1, he is wearing a white button-up shirt. In statement 2, he is wearing a white shirt. Although the shirt in statement 2 could also be a button-up shirt, the specific detail is not mentioned. This difference leaves room for potential inconsistencies between the statements. - Both statements mention that the man is addressing a group of people. - Statement 2 adds the detail that the man is addressing the group during a training session. This detail is not mentioned in statement 1, which could apply to a variety of settings, such as a conference, a meeting, or a social event. Based on the analysis above, it does not logically follow that statement 2 is necessarily true, given statement 1.

Sinn Féin reiterated on Saturday that it would not go back into government with Mrs Foster as first minister until her role in a botched heating scheme was \\"cleared up\\". Political talks will begin on Monday. Mrs Foster set up the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in 2012. It was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly energy sources. But subsidies were overly generous and initially there was no cap on the payments. It later emerged the scheme was expected to cost the Northern Ireland tax payer £490m. Deputy First Minster Martin McGuinness, from Sinn Féin, resigned from his post in January after Mrs Foster rejected his calls for her to temporarily stand aside as first minister while an investigation into the scheme is carried out. His decision to quit led to a snap election which saw Sinn Féin increase its vote, cutting the DUP's lead to one seat. Mr Robinson told BBC 5Live's Stephen Nolan show: \\"I'm not ruling it out on the basis that if it was a decision for Arlene to take and one she made herself then the party would discuss that and consider it.\\" He added that it had been a \\"difficult election\\" and a \\"bad day for unionism\\". Mr Adams hailed the election result as a \\"watershed\\" moment but said Sinn Féin was making contact with all party leaders to discuss the return of power-sharing. He said the party's call for Mrs Foster to step aside during an investigation was \\"not a precondition\\" to Sinn Féin entering talks with the DUP. Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, unionists and nationalists must agree to share power for devolved government to function. \\"We have never said that Arlene Foster has to step aside before negotiations happen. Arlene Foster is the leader of the DUP and we accept that absolutely,\\" Mr Adams told reporters. \\"The first position that we put to them [the DUP] was that Arlene Foster should stand aside until there was a preliminary report. \\"We're now being told that there's not going to be a preliminary report - where all this comes from, none of us know, the inquiry hasn't set out its mode of operation.\\" Mr Adams said the inquiry team \\"might decide that it could bring forward a preliminary report\\" or deal with the issues \\"in modular form\\", but added the inquiry could also take up to a year. He pointed to Mrs Foster's predecessor Peter Robinson, who stepped aside twice until to allow preliminary inquiries into allegations against him. \\"Our position is very, very straightforward. We will not be consenting to Arlene Foster being the first minister until this issue is cleared up,\\" the Sinn Féin president said. There is now a three-week deadline for unionists and nationalists to form a power-sharing government. The Sinn Féin delegation will be led into talks on Monday by its northern leader, Michelle O'Neill. She said: \\"The task is not easy, but it is achievable if people come at it with the right attitude.\\" The nationalist SDLP also overtook the Ulster Unionist Party for the first time, meaning Stormont no longer has a unionist majority. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt announced he was stepping down as a result of his party's disappointing performance. If a government cannot be formed within the next three weeks, under law, another election will be called. Ultimately, if no power-sharing government is formed, devolved power could return to the UK parliament at Westminster for the first time in a decade. Secretary of State James Brokenshire said the election had demonstrated the desire by the overwhelming majority of voters for inclusive, devolved government. \\"Everyone now has a shared responsibility to engage intensively in the short period of time that is available to us, to ensure that a strong and stable administration is established,\\" he said. The BBC News NI website will carry all the latest on the election throughout the weekend.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A survey suggests that people who have dropped out from high school just earn an average of 9,000 less per year than graduates. Now a new study removes a common belief why they quit. It's much more basic than flunking out . Society tends to think of high school dropouts as kids who just can't cut it. They are lazy, and perhaps not too bright. So researchers were surprised when they asked more than 450 kids who quit school about why they left. \\"The vast majority actually had passing grades and they were confident that they could have graduated from high school.\\" John Bridgeland, the executive researcher said. About one million teens leave school each year. Only about half of African-American and Hispanic students will receive a diploma , and actually all dropouts come to regret their decision. So, if failing grades don't explain why these kids quit, what does? Again, John Bridgeland: \\"The most dependable finding was that they were bored.\\" \\"They found classes uninteresting; they weren't inspired or motivated. They didn't see any direct connection between what they were learning in the classroom to their own lives, or to their career aspirations.\\" The study found that most teens who do drop out wait until they turn sixteen, which happens to be the age at which most states allow students to quit. In the U.S., only one state, New Mexico, has a law requiring teenagers to stay in high school until they graduate. Only four states: California, Tennessee, Texas and Utah, plus the District of Columbia, require school attendance until age 18, no exceptions. Jeffrey Grin, another researcher, says raising the compulsory attendance age may be one way to keep more kids in school. \\"As these dropouts look back, they realize they've made a mistake. And anything that sort of gives these people an extra push to stick it out and see it through to the end, is probably helpful measure.\\" New Hampshire may be the next state to raise its school attendance age to 18.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 3.17b). Proteins hold the cells tightly against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the extracellular space. Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 3.17c). They keep cells together in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles. Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 3.17d). Structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.

Input: CONTEXT: Chocolate is an odd substance when it comes to melting and hardening. When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it. It might even melt while stored.Tempering is the key to making a room-temperature-stable chocolate coating.

Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize.

Snow chains are intended to help you gain traction in the wheels that push the vehicle. Depending on the application, that may be the front wheels, the rear wheels, or all four. Pick from: 1). Don't forget to consider your driving situation as well. If the trucks are small, there may be a back wheel and a front wheel with four.. 2). When you've found the exact direction you'd like your snow chains to move, measure the vehicle's tire depth (km) and the truck's bore depth (km) through the road. Measure the surrounding area with a measuring tape and have the vehicle visual visually (through keyhole).. 3). Refer to your vehicle's owner's manual if you are unsure which wheels are the drive wheels. Front wheel drive cars (fwd) will use snow chains on the front wheels.. 4). Drive wheels can be incredibly difficult to attach to the vehicle from the ground. If either way you can safely attach snow chains to the tires inside your car is to be selected..","completion":"Once you have identified the drive wheels of your vehicle, follow these steps to install snow chains: 1. Prepare the snow chains: Lay out the chains on a flat surface to make sure there are no tangled or damaged links. If they're adjustable, ensure that they are set to the correct tire size. 2. Choose the correct type of snow chain according to your driving situation and the wheel type you have identified in the previous steps of the paragraph. 3. Refer to your vehicle's owner's manual for information on which wheels are the drive wheels. For front-wheel drive cars, you'll need to put snow chains on the front wheels. 4. If you are unsure about the tire and bore depth of your vehicle, measure them using a measuring tape. This will help you to install the snow chains properly. 5. Find a safe and level area to install the snow chains. Make sure the area around your vehicle is clear of any hazards or obstacles. 6. Turn off your car's engine and apply the parking brake for safety. You can also put on safety gear such as gloves and protective eyewear to avoid any injuries while installing the snow chains. 7. Begin installing the snow chains on the designated drive wheels. Start by sliding the chains behind the tire, and then bring the two ends of the chain together at the top of the tire. Connect the ends securely, making sure the chains are snug and centered on the tire tread. If your chains come with tensioners, you might want to consider using them for a more secure fit. 8. After you've installed the snow chains on one tire, move on to the next drive wheel and repeat the process. 9. Carefully drive forward a few feet after installing the chains on all drive wheels, and then stop and check to make sure they're still securely attached and properly adjusted. 10. Remember to adjust your driving behavior when using snow chains. Reduce your speed to avoid damaging your vehicle, the road, or the chains themselves. Additionally, avoid sudden turns or accelerations, and give yourself ample distance for braking. 11. Keep a close eye on the condition of the snow chains during your journey, and remove them as soon as you are driving on clear pavement. Leaving the chains on can potentially damage your vehicle and the road surface. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install snow chains on your vehicle and ensure a safer driving experience in snowy or icy conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As young Chinese increasingly forget how to write characters because they don't have to, using keyboards and touch screen technology on mobile phones is changing the trend. For Yin Liang, a 26-year-old purchasing agent at a company, his embarrassment over forgetting how to write characters has gradually disappeared since he started to use the handwriting input method on his iPhone 4 a month ago. \\"When you write on the touch screen, you use your finger, instead of a mouse or keyboard,\\" Yin says. \\"Actually, your finger is like a pen, writing the complicated characters that have long been spelled by pinyin, an alphabet-based input system. Whether typing on computers or texting on phones, most users in China type by phonetically spelling out the sounds of the characters and the software then gives a menu of characters that fit the pronunciation, so users only need to recognize the character. Handwriting technology on a mobile phone touch screen has been around for years and became popular with the iPhone, which recognizes the input and offers a wide selection of characters. \\"It's efficient and accurate,\\" Yin says. Chinese characters are the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world, but as pinyin-based typing has become more widespread, youths have started forgetting how to write out characters. This was one of the main topics for debate at the first Cross-Straits Chinese Character Art Festival, held recently in Beijing, which attracted experts from Taiwan and the mainland. According to Zhang Zikang, president of the Culture and Art Publishing House, writing with a pen on the touch screen brings handwriting into the digital age. It is even better when you write with your finger, feeling the flow of the cursive script and the grace and art of Chinese characters, he says. \\"Smart gadgets don't take life from the square-shaped characters, instead they offer a new and advanced platform to show the charm of Chinese characters, which are always evolving,\\" Zhang says.

This conclusion is deduced from various signals within the reviewer's statements. Firstly, the reviewer explicitly states they found the movie to be slow, predictable, and campy. These are all negative qualities suggesting the user did not enjoy the pacing, the predictability, and the tone of the movie. Secondly, the reviewer criticised the performance of the actors, and felt the character has not evolved which indicates dissatisfaction with characterisation and the acting. Finally, the given rating of 3.5/5 could be seen as mediocre, which supports the overall negative sentiment implied throughout the rest of the review. Even though a score of 3.5 out of 5 might not indicate a 'bad' movie in general, in this context it seems that the reviewer expected more from the film. Overall, the reviewer expressed more negative thoughts than positive, leading to the judgement of a negative opinion about the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Contrary to people's previous knowledge, it's food shortage not dietary preference that motivates birds to migrate thousands of miles back and forth between breeding and nonbreeding areas each year, a new research shows. \\"It's not whether you eat insects,fruits or candy bars or where you eat them that counts,but how reliable that daytoday food source is,\\" said the study leader W.Alice Boyle of the University of Arizona. To figure out the underlying pressure that drives some birds to leave home for the season,Boyle examined 379 related species of New World flycatchers and compared their sizes,food types, habitats, migratory behaviors and whether or not they fed in flocks. To compare the birds,the researchers constructed a \\"supertree\\" showing the exact evolutionary relationships among different species. A computer analysis then determined whether a particular species was migratory because it ran in the \\"family\\" or whether something in the bird's environment was forcing it to leave each season.Boyle and her colleagues found that food shortage was the number one issue that predicted a species' migratory behavior. \\"Food availability is the underlying pressure, not diet and habitat,\\" Boyle said. An alternative strategy that the birds use to handle food shortage is to hunt in flocks, since a group is more likely to find a new source of food than an individual. \\"If you suffer from food shortage, you have two options,\\" Boyle said.\\"You can either hunt with other birds or you can migrate.\\" Question: For what purpose does the author write the text?

This is achieved through the establishment clause, which prevents the government from endorsing or supporting any particular religion, and the free exercise clause, which ensures individuals' freedom to practice their chosen religion without government interference.

Summarize this article: Media playback is not supported on this device Rooney, with 53 England goals in 119 appearances, left Manchester United to return to Everton this summer with his place in Old Trafford's history books also assured after he overtook Sir Bobby Charlton's club record with 253 goals. He had been sidelined by Jose Mourinho at United, and also by Southgate with England, but such has been his early rejuvenation at Goodison Park that he was offered a place back in the fold for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. Rooney, who originally planned to end his England career after next summer's World Cup in Russia, decided against a return and will now focus fully on Everton. So how will history judge Wayne Rooney's England career? Those of us fortunate to be in Portugal for the long, hot summer of Euro 2004 will remember the rise of this phenomenon and how Everton's 18-year-old became the most talked-about player at a tournament eventually won by rank outsiders Greece. Rooney had made his debut, and become England's youngest player at 17 years and 111 days, in a defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003. But it was his deeds in Lisbon against France, where he gave an experienced defence a harrowing night in a 2-1 loss at the iconic Stadium of Light, as well as scoring twice against Switzerland and Croatia, that thrust him into the global spotlight. Media playback is not supported on this device Suddenly, the quiet youngster who played football from the streets was the name on everyone's lips. Calls to hotels and mobile phones were being fielded from around the world, seeking the story of the Croxteth boy who played in an untamed style that had suddenly transformed him into a superstar. As someone who attended the same De La Salle School in Liverpool, it was easier for me to paint a picture of his working-class background and the environment that had shaped his development - on the school playground in Carr Lane East and in junior sides before joining Everton. Rooney himself was largely protected from the mounting media attention, but his football did the talking. Phil Neville, a fellow England squad member at Euro 2004, recalls: \\"I remember when he first got into the squad - the youthfulness, the bravery, the courage he showed, particularly at his first major tournament in Portugal. \\"He was a breath of fresh air. No-one enjoyed playing for England more than Wayne Rooney.\\" This Euro 2004 episode ended in misery when Rooney broke his foot early in the quarter-final against Portugal, which England lost on penalties. Many felt England would have won that tournament had Rooney stayed fit, but he had made an indelible mark - life would never be the same as he embarked on an international career lived under intense personal and sporting scrutiny. Media playback is not supported on this device If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote. This vote closes at 1900 BST on Thursday, 24 August, and the result will be available on this page. Rooney's stratospheric rise in Portugal sent expectation through the roof, his unstoppable blend of power, awareness and potency in front of goal leaving England fans hoping they had finally found the talisman to end the years of frustration since the World Cup win of 1966. Sadly, this proved beyond not just him but a generation of world-class players such as Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Chelsea's Frank Lampard and the likes of Paul Scholes and David Beckham from Manchester United. The 'golden generation' could not reproduce their consistent success at club level once in England colours. Rooney's legacy will be coloured by his failure to make a mark on another major tournament. Not fully fit, he was sent off in another quarter-final defeat to Portugal at the 2006 World Cup, and was then the most obvious symbol of the frustrations felt inside the infamous 'Camp Capello' in South Africa in 2010. Manager Fabio Capello's decision to keep England's players miles off the beaten track - when they threw open their bedroom windows there would not have been the slightest clue they were in Africa - seemed to particularly affect Rooney, someone who did not apparently need or enjoy downtime. He described a typical day as \\"breakfast, training, lunch, dinner, bed\\", adding for good measure \\"there are only so many games of darts and snooker you can play\\". Rooney's dark mood surfaced as he shouted criticism of England's supporters into a television camera following a horrific goalless draw with Algeria in Cape Town before England were thrashed by Germany in the last 16. For all his effort - and you only had to listen to Rooney at close quarters to sense his desire and commitment - it simply never happened for him at another tournament. Rooney missed the start of Euro 2012 through suspension after being sent off in a qualifier in Montenegro and while he was actually one of England's better performers at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and at last summer's Euro 2016 in France, the abiding memory will be of abject humiliation on both occasions - failure to reach the knockout stage then a last-16 exit to Iceland. Rooney scored just one goal in 11 appearances at World Cup finals from 21 attempted shots. It is a telling statistic for him, and for England. The counterpoint to this is that only Gary Lineker (10) and Alan Shearer (nine) scored more than Rooney's seven goals for England at major tournaments. But it seemed the harder Rooney tried the more this success eluded him, and when his England career is examined, it will be through the prism of these let-downs - something that still hurts enough to warrant a mention in his retirement statement. And yet Sven-Goran Eriksson, the man who gave him his England debut, believes Rooney could have stayed on to make an impact at next summer's World Cup. In giving a glowing tribute to BBC World Service, the Swede said: \\"If he goes on playing like he is now, scoring goals for Everton, then he could still have been an important player. If I was England manager I would do everything to convince Rooney to play at the World Cup then make a decision.\\" And he recalled the player he worked with as he said: \\"I remember when training was finished Rooney didn't want to leave the training ground. He wanted to stay doing free-kicks, shooting etc. \\"He's tough, a great player, hard worker, has everything as a football player. He was mature at 17. I remember I told him the day before his debut for England that he was going to start he just said 'OK' like it was normal. It was not normal at 17.\\" Rooney's England record is in the books and cannot be erased - but he may just fall short of the status of \\"great\\" afforded to Sir Bobby Charlton, whose goals record he broke for Manchester United and his country. Charlton has an accolade shared by only 11 Englishmen, a World Cup winners' medal, while Rooney was perhaps a victim of his own stunning early success. But he will be recalled, certainly by those who have followed the England camp closely throughout his international career, as someone who was endlessly committed to his country. He was always the consummate team player, always willing to sacrifice his own needs and personal preferences if he thought it would achieve the desired result. As an example, he willingly shifted to the left-flank, unfamiliar territory, to accommodate the shock inclusion of Raheem Sterling against Italy in Manaus at the 2014 World Cup. Whenever the case was made for his exclusion, as it occasionally was, the counter-argument posed was whether England would be a better team without him. The answer was rarely yes. England team-mates spoke with almost unanimous respect for his presence inside the dressing room and on the field. He was, in dressing room parlance, a player's player. Rooney's work-rate was prodigious, often leading to him appearing in areas of the pitch where he was not at his most effective, but it was always done with the best of intentions, fuelled by an unquenchable desire to win - something that often caused his volatile temperament to boil over. Throughout all the years and managerial changes, as well as starting alongside 86 different players, Rooney was always regarded by Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson as the key member of their team. Time ran out under Gareth Southgate as Rooney struggled at Manchester United, but even he was ready to bring him back after his early excellence for Everton. And if respect among opposing players and managers is a measure of Rooney's stature, then it was also a running theme throughout his career that he was invariably the man they feared most in England's team. It is perhaps a sign of his selflessness that he has decided to bow out now rather than take the opportunity to close in on the seven more England caps he needed to pass goalkeeper Peter Shilton's record tally of 125 but it appears he has listened to his body and called it a day. \\"He's definitely the greatest goalscorer we've ever had,\\" said Neville. \\"I think he's made the right call for his career and probably made the right call for Gareth Southgate as well. He's gone out at the top and as England's greatest ever goalscorer - what a classy way to bow out from what's been a fabulous international career.\\" Of course, it is impossible to paint a glorious unblemished canvas of his England career, with two red cards and his role in squads that failed at major tournaments, but Rooney has a record that he can be justly proud of and can take his place in the Football Association's Hall Of Fame. Wayne Rooney is England's all-time record goalscorer - this is the immediate factual, historic legacy. And it may well be that in time Rooney might actually come to be regarded as under-rated and under-appreciated, his career finally being put in perspective away from the initial excitement. Rooney will hold his record for many years to come and one of those who may yet threaten it, Tottenham's Harry Kane, tweeted after his retreat from the international scene: \\"Wayne Rooney. An amazing player and goalscorer for England. A Three Lions Legend.\\" And Michael Owen, who shared those heady early days in Portugal in 2004 as Rooney's strike partner, responded to his decision with: \\"Brilliant timing. Always go out on top. Well done Wayne Rooney. An international career to be proud of.\\" Lineker, third in England's goal standings behind Rooney and Charlton, added: \\"England's highest ever goalscorer calls it a day. Congratulations to Wayne Rooney on a magnificent international career. A player's player.\\" Indeed, it was Lineker who described Rooney as \\"under-appreciated\\" after he scored in Everton's 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Monday, stating: \\"He'd be one of Britain's top 10 ever. He's had a marvellous career.\\" Neville now hopes the FA can let Rooney take one final England post-retirement bow when they face Slovakia at Wembley, saying: \\"I hope they get Wayne down to Wembley next Monday and he can stand on Wembley with England for the last time, the fans can applaud him, cheer him, thank him. \\"He can thank them and he can go down to Wembley with his wife and children and have one last goodbye.\\" He may not have played a part in ending England's so-called 'years of hurt' and there will always be an element of 'what might have been', but Rooney deserves great admiration and respect. He may have fallen short of the international greatness so many of us expected but he will be regarded as one of the finest players ever to represent England, a player who made history. That alone is tribute and testimony enough.","completion":"Former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has retired from international football after scoring 53 goals in 119 appearances for England.

To fully understand the sentiment, let's break the sentence down into its individual words and analyze their meanings and connotations. 1. \\"Incredibly\\": This adverb is used to emphasize the intensity or degree of a specific quality or characteristic. It may be interpreted as \\"to an extraordinary extent\\" or \\"very much so.\\" In this context, \\"incredibly\\" is strengthening the meaning of the subsequent word, \\"inane.\\" The use of \\"incredibly\\" as an intensifier indicates that the speaker has a strong feeling about the topic being referenced. 2. \\"Inane\\": This adjective refers to something that is empty of meaning, void of intellectual value or significance, or lacking sense or purpose. It is commonly used to describe ideas, actions, or statements that are considered silly, foolish, or absurd. The word has a negative connotation, suggesting disapproval or criticism on the part of the speaker. When these two words are combined in the sentence \\"incredibly inane,\\" the sentiment conveyed is a heightened level of negativity or criticism. The speaker is expressing an intense level of disapproval, as they view the subject matter as being extremely nonsensical, insignificant, or meaningless. In addition, the degree of negativity perceived by the reader or listener may also depend on the context in which the statement is made. For example, if the sentence is uttered in reference to a particular statement or action, it signals strong disapproval. Alternatively, if the sentence is used as a general comment without a specific reference, the sentiment may be perceived as more dismissive or disdainful. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"incredibly inane\\" is perceived as negative, disapproving, or critical, with the speaker expressing a strong sense of disdain or disapproval for something they deem to be highly senseless or insignificant. The context in which the sentence is used will further influence the exact interpretation of the sentiment by the reader or listener."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Joseph Rotblat (4 November 1908 - 31 August 2005) was a Polish physicist, a self-described \\"Pole with a British passport\\". Rotblat worked on Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project during World War II, but left the Los Alamos Laboratory after the war with Germany ended. His work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward the ratification of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A signatory of the 1955 Russell-Einstein Manifesto, he was secretary-general of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from their founding until 1973, and shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize \\"for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.\\" Rotblat returned to Britain to become senior lecturer and acting director of research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With the help of a Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczyslaw (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the fact that she was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography. Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research. Rotblat was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends, and so became interested in the medical and biological uses of radiation. In 1949, he became Professor of Physics at St Bartholomew's Hospital (\\"Barts\\"), London, a teaching hospital associated with the University of London. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a professor emeritus in 1976. He received his PhD from Liverpool in 1950, having written his thesis on the \\"Determination of a number of neutrons emitted from a source\\". He also worked on several official bodies connected with nuclear physics, and arranged the Atom Train, a major travelling exhibition for schools on civil nuclear energy. At St Bartholomew's, Rotblat worked on the effects of radiation on living organisms, especially on ageing and fertility. This led him to an interest in nuclear fallout, especially strontium-90 and the safe limits of ionising radiation. In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout after the Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll nuclear test by the United States would have been far greater than that stated officially. Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon, which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times. His paper was taken up by the media and contributed to the public debate that resulted in the ending of atmospheric tests by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Why did he feel that way?","completion":"Sir Joseph Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan and called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research because he was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends.

Q:Information: - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a thin vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows. - Lucerne (Lucerne Swiss-German: \\"Lozärn\\") is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name.

The city's urban area consists of 17 municipalities and towns located in three different cantons with an overall population of about 250,000 people. - \\"Country House\\" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album \\"The Great Escape\\" on 14 August 1995. \\"Country House\\" was the first of two Blur singles to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart (the second being 1997's \\"Beetlebum\\"). - Meggen is a municipality in the district of Lucerne in the canton of Lucerne in Switzerland. - Mulhouse (Alsatian: \\"Milhüsa\\" or \\"Milhüse\\", i.e. \\"mill house\\") is a city and commune in eastern France, close to the Swiss and German borders. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Flying for the holidays? Frequent fliers have some tips By Gary Stoller, USA TODAY To avoid congested roads and crowded airports, frequent traveler Rip Russell will fly home on Thanksgiving morning and fly back to his job in Russell, a production accountant working on a movie, says flying on those days to and from Atlanta shortens his holiday but reduces stress. \\"By traveling on the shoulders of these megapeak days, I'm far less likely to arrive stressed from the in-bound trip and the anticipation of the dreaded Sunday-after airport pressure cooker,\\" Russell says. About 24 million air travelers — nearly 4% more than last year — are expected to fly on U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday, estimates the Air Transport Association, which represents the carriers. Many travelers will be amateurs by the standards of Russell and other frequent fliers. They'll not have flown since this time last year or maybe two or three years ago, when planes and airports weren't as crowded as they'll be this month or next for the Christmas holiday. They lack the strategies that people who put in 50, 100 or more days on the road each year use to avoid hassles and stay cool, calm and collected while trying to get to their destinations. For those infrequent travelers, Russell and other frequent fliers from USA TODAY's panel of Road Warriors, who log millions of miles a year in the sky, offer some tips to ensure holidays aren't spoiled by the rigors of travel. Russell, for instance, suggests avoiding connecting flights on small regional jets in addition to avoiding peak travel days. Instead, he says, he drives the 2½ hours from Atlanta to his cabin in Waynesville, N.C. \\"I avoid the overpriced and cramped regional jet experience,\\" Russell says. \\"The cost savings is significant, and there are fewer headaches and opportunities for flight-related delays or lost luggage.\\" •Jeff Jones, a manager for a food industry manufacturer, says he books an early-morning flight, because airport traffic is lighter, and he has more flight options if his morning flight is canceled or delayed. He also checks in ahead of time online to avoid a wait at the airline counter. \\"I always allow more time for everything,\\" says Jones of Madison, Wis. \\"I double the amount of time I usually plan for getting through security.\\" •Christian Johnson, a vice president for a gaming company, says he books only non-stop flights. \\"Connections domestically are very difficult and unpredictable in the best of times,\\" says Johnson of Las Vegas. \\"During holidays, it's a crapshoot.\\" •Tony Goddard, COO of a company in West Seneca, N.Y., that manufactures equipment for the aviation industry, recommends that fliers without elite frequent-flier program privileges book higher-priced tickets. \\"If a flight is oversold or canceled, and you are fighting for a seat on the next available flight, a higher fare will put you much higher up on a standby list,\\" Goddard says. •Bob Bender, an architect in Lenexa, Kan., says holiday travelers should pack light but make sure necessary items such as prescription medicine and phone numbers are available if a flight is delayed. Bender and other frequent fliers advise travelers to not carry Christmas presents through security but instead ship them or put them in checked bags. Security screeners at passenger checkpoints \\"like boxes that are wrapped,\\" Bender says. Maybe the most important advice, some veteran travelers say, is to be at ease and have a positive mind-set when navigating through even the most crowded of airports, such as Atlanta's Hartsfield or Chicago's O'Hare, the nation's two busiest, respectively. \\"Relax and give yourself time to take in the displays that most large airports have available,\\" Bender says. \\"Atlanta has a great display of African art in the tunnel under the concourses. Chicago has the airplane flown by Lt. Cmdr. Edward O'Hare. And Denver has a great art display on the bridge between the main terminal and Concourse A.\\" Kevin Korterud, a consultant in New Albany, Ohio, says he enjoys flying just before Thanksgiving. \\"I feel a collective experience with so many people headed to destinations anticipating happy times,\\" he says.

Context: St. Ives Town F.C. is a football club based in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England. They play in the Southern League Premier Division. This St Ives Town should not be confused with the Cornwall Combination team playing in St Ives, Cornwall, which is also called St Ives Town F.C. Hypothesis: St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK based on the context provided. Here is a detailed analysis supporting this hypothesis: Firstly, the context presents two different football clubs that share the same name - St. Ives Town F.C. We can identify them by their geographical locations: 1. St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England: One St. Ives Town F.C. is based in St Ives, a market town in Cambridgeshire, England. It is mentioned that this team competes in the Southern League Premier Division. 2. St Ives, Cornwall, England: The other St. Ives Town F.C. is located in St Ives, a seaside town in Cornwall, England. This team participates in the Cornwall Combination, which is a regional football competition. It is important to note that both Cambridgeshire and Cornwall are counties in England, which is a constituent country of the United Kingdom (UK). The UK is formed by the union of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Given that both football clubs are based in England, we can safely hypothesize that St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK. Moreover, as both teams play in different leagues, the context also suggests that these clubs are distinguished from each other based on their geographical locations within the UK, despite sharing the same name. In conclusion, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to derive the hypothesis that St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK, as both football clubs with this name are located in England, a country that forms part of the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Q: What type of bond generally forms between a metal and non-metal? Choices: - soluble - unbreakable - horizontal - ionic A: Answer:","completion":"Ionic An ionic bond generally forms between a metal and non-metal. To better understand why this is the case, it is essential to first comprehend the basics behind ionic bonding. Ionic bonding occurs when atoms transfer electrons from one another to attain a full outer shell of valence electrons and become more stable. Metals, which are found on the left side of the periodic table, tend to lose electrons to achieve stability, as they typically have one to three electrons in their outer shell. Non-metals, which are found on the right side of the periodic table, tend to gain electrons, as they have a more significant number of valence electrons and require fewer electrons to complete their outer shell. When a metal loses an electron, it forms a positively charged ion called a cation. On the other hand, when a non-metal gains an electron, it forms a negatively charged ion called an anion. This transfer of electrons creates an electrostatic attraction between these charged ions, which is called an ionic bond. To illustrate this, consider the example of sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a classic example of an ionic compound formed between a metal (sodium, Na) and a non-metal (chlorine, Cl). Sodium has one electron in its outer shell, while chlorine has seven. The sodium atom donates one electron to the chlorine atom, resulting in a positively charged sodium ion (Na+) and a negatively charged chloride ion (Cl-). The ionic bond between these ions holds them together and forms a crystal lattice structure. In summary, ionic bonds typically occur between metals and non-metals due to the transfer of electrons, forming charged ions that are attracted to each other. This type of bonding is responsible for the formation of various compounds, which possess unique physicochemical properties. Among the given choices, \\"Ionic\\" is the correct answer to the question of what type of bond generally forms between a metal and a non-metal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sandman (Wesley Dodds) is a fictional character, a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first of several DC characters to bear the name Sandman, he was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Bert Christman. Attired in a green business suit, fedora, and gas mask, the Sandman used a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He was originally one of the mystery men to appear in comic books and other types of adventure fiction in the 1930s but later was outfitted with a unitard/cowl costume and developed into a proper superhero, acquiring sidekick Sandy, and founding the Justice Society of America. Dodds is one of a number of Justice Society members who finds themselves in the \\"Ragnarok Dimension\\" during the early Modern Age of comic books. The Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special (1986) wrote the post-Crisis tale of a time-warped wave of destruction ready to engulf the world. Dodds and his JSA teammates enter into a limbo to engage in an eternal battle that would allow the universe to continue its existence. This was later revealed to be a simulation created by Odin, which he intended to give to Dream as a bribe. Dodds, Dream's protege, and Hawkman, the grandfather of Dream's appointed successor are the only JSA members we see at this time. This lasted only until 1992 when DC published Armageddon: Inferno. This mini-series ended with the JSA members leaving limbo and entering the 'real' world. Justice Society of America (1992-1993) showed how the JSA members handled returning to normal life. For the Sandman, the series depicted him as an old, thin man with a balding scalp and a sharp wit. Starting with issue #1 his physical condition became important as writer Len Strazewski had him suffer a stroke at the first sign of a villainous attack. Both his age and his physical limitations became a theme writers would use in this character's post-Crisis stories. During Zero Hour, Dodds is returned to his proper age by the Extant. Later, Wesley Dodds is shown as retired and living with Dian Belmont though occasionally coming out of it, most notably in a team-up with Jack Knight, the son of Dodds' JSA teammate Starman. When Dian is diagnosed with a terminal disease, the two travel the world together until her death. Towards the end of his life, Dodds' prophetic dreams alert him to the identity and location of the new Doctor Fate, prompting him to contact the Gray Man, a being created from the residue of others' dreams, as well as his old friend Speed Saunders to instruct them to warn his former teammates about what he has discovered. Waiting on a clifftop, he is subsequently confronted by the powerful villain Mordru, who intends to force Dodds to tell him the identity of the new Doctor Fate, only for Dodds to distract Mordru with his gas-gun long enough to commit suicide by jumping off the cliff rather than allow Mordru to torture him into submission. His last thoughts were that his final slumber would be free of nightmares as he is reunited with Dian. His youthful but now grown-up sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy, becomes known simply as Sand and takes his mentor's place as a member of the Justice Society of America as well as his prophetic dreams.

On Saturday, he was lured away from the gate to his enclosure by a staff member. The distraction was meant to help park owner, 72-year-old Mike Hodge, open the gate to exit the park. It was described as a routine precaution, but on that day, it was anything but. Mike Hodge Marakele Animal Sanctuary Suddenly, Hodge frantically ran back to the vehicle, as Shamba chased after him. Then the lion pounced and dragged him into the bushes. Shocked and terrified tourists screamed for help as the male lion mauled Hodge. Eventually, shots rang out, and at the end of the ordeal, Shamba was killed to save Hodge's life. Hodge was airlifted to a Johannesburg hospital, where he is being treated for severe lacerations and a broken jaw. His family said they are devastated by the loss of 10-year-old Shamba, who was hand-reared and bottle fed as a cub by Hodge, like many other animals at the sanctuary. The incident has once again raised concerns about the ethics of breeding lions in captivity. Critics say they become used to humans, but at the end of the day they are still wild animals. ||||| Update | The owner of an animal sanctuary in Limpopo, South Africa, was attacked by a lion on Saturday in an incident that left the man needing medical attention. The family named the vicitm as Michael Hodge of the Marakele Animal Sanctuary. Phone calls and email to the Marakele Animal Sanctuary were not answered. In a press release sent to reporters, spokesperson for the family, Bernadette Maguire, said that the incident had occured on Saturday as Hodge was showing tourists around the sanctuary.

Mike Hodge was pounced on by the lion as he tried to leave through a gate. Video footage showed him being dragged off towards bushes. Onlookers could be heard screaming during the incident at Marakele animal sanctuary in Thabazimbi. It was reported that Hodge entered the lion’s enclosure over concerns about a smell in the compound that was bothering it. A South African police spokesman, Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe, told News24 that Hodge had sustained injuries to his neck and jaw in the incident on Monday. “The owner was immediately taken to hospital with serious injuries. He is currently recuperating,” he said. The animal park’s website says Mike and Chrissy Hodge moved to South Africa from the UK in 1999 and opened their lion project in 2003. Realising there was a need for a tourist attraction closer to the town of Thabazimbi, they eventually opened the Marakele sanctuary in December 2010.

Now, we combine these terms by adding the coefficients: -3 - 12 = -15 So, the equation becomes: -15*d = 75 Step 2: Solve for d Now we need to isolate the variable 'd' to find its value. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d, which is -15: -15*d / -15 = 75 / -15 Now, divide: d = -5 So, the solution to the equation -3*d - 12*d = 75 is d = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - William M. Kelso, C.B.E., Ph. D., F.S.A. (born 1941), often referred to as Bill Kelso, is an American archaeologist specializing in Virginia's colonial period, particularly the Jamestown colony. - The Virginia Company refers collectively to two joint stock companies chartered by James I on 10 April 1606 with the purposes of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. The two companies, called the \\"Virginia Company of London\\" (or the London Company) and the \\"Virginia Company of Plymouth\\" (or Plymouth Company) operated with identical charters but with differing territories. An area of overlapping territory was created within which the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other. The Plymouth Company never fulfilled its charter, and its territory that later became New England was at that time also claimed by England. - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England. - Christopher Newport (15611617) was an English seaman and privateer. He is best known as the captain of the \\"Susan Constant\\", the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the \\"Godspeed\\" and the \\"Discovery\\". - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Susan Constant , captained by Christopher Newport , was the largest of three ships of the English Virginia Company ( the others being Discovery and Godspeed ) on the 1606 -- 1607 voyage that resulted in the founding of Jamestown in the new Colony of Virginia .

Given the question: Whose successor created two additional hierarchical posts and added 16 more prebendary canons? Answer the above question based on the context below: The dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed. Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and...

The resulting translation, \\"మేము తీరం చేరినప్పుడు, కొద్దిగా సమయం విభజించాలి,\\" conveys the meaning of the original English sentence in Telugu."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The brand, which carved a niche for itself in the realm of high-end fashion, found itself in a financial turmoil, ultimately leading to its collapse. Loyal patrons, who invested in the label based on the credibility of the stars that publicly supported it, are now voicing their discontent and seeking answers. Background The celebrity-backed label's journey began with the intention of revolutionizing the fashion industry. The brand had its sights set on setting a new bar for quality, design, and style, and managed to garner attention from high-profile personalities. These notable figures not only endorsed the label but also flaunted their latest collections, contributing to a rapid rise in the brand's popularity. With sales soaring, the brand appeared on track for continued success; however, this was merely a mirage. Financial Struggles & Collapse Despite the support from a roster of celebrities, the brand was unable to sustain its initial success. The growing financial struggles, including steep manufacturing costs, unrealistic pricing, and intense competition, began to take a toll on the business. Reports have also suggested the possible mismanagement of funds, which exacerbated the situation. The brand's shocking bankruptcy has been met with exasperation by fans and customers who invested a significant amount of money in this now-defunct label. Apart from being unable to use the products they paid for, customers are feeling all the more aggrieved due to the involvement of celebrities who had led them to believe in the brand's promise. Customers' Reactions & the Role of Celebrities Given the financial turmoil the brand has found itself in, many customers feel deceived by these celebrities who'd endorsed the label. Questions are being raised about whether the stars who flaunted the label were aware of its precarious financial situation, and if they inadvertently influenced their fans to make ill-advised purchases. Some customers even demand that celebrities be held accountable for the financial losses they have incurred, as they based their decisions on the celebrity endorsements. The celebrity-supported label's demise serves as a reminder to consumers about the importance of exercising caution when making purchasing decisions. Evaluating a brand based on its merits, rather than relying solely on celebrity endorsements, is crucial to avoid potential disappointment. In the meantime, the fashion label's customers have been left fuming, and the industry is abuzz with discussions about the downfalls of celebrity-driven marketing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I don't remember what hotel we went to first, but over the phone they told us that they allowed dogs and when we got there, they told us no pets. It was quite frustrating. Not only had my car overheated but then this. So we kept driving around in about 115 degree heat in the middle of summer just getting really really tired of driving. Finally after about 3 other places we finally came here and they said they allowed small dogs. We were in luck. I think we actually got a pretty good deal too. The room was nice and it overlooked the strip and you could see a nearby airport across the way. I loved their large windows and just sat there on the floor looking out just admiring the lights and traffic etc. Yeah I'm weird like that. My dog sat with me which was kind of funny since I thought she might not like the height we were at. It was really packed with people down on the strip and there were a lot of hotel room parties going on. Walls are kind of thin or they just had the music way loud. Then again, they seemed to be talking in normal tones, but you could hear the majority of their conversations, which I particularly didn't like. The service was good and the rooms were cleanly compared to other places I've been to. This was my second trip to Vegas with my family in years. I didn't go into the casino area since I was underage at the time and spent most of the night with my camera outside taking pictures along the strip. That was actually pretty nice. There were a lot of the people handing out cards and the sidewalk was littered with them. Anyways, going off topic but the beds were very comfortable and I think we had room service cause everywhere we went was packed and we didn't want to deal with it.

Information: - The Criminal Code or Code criminel is a law that codifies most criminal offences and procedures in Canada . Its official long title is \`\` An Act respecting the criminal law '' ( R.S.C. 1985 , c. C - 46 , as amended ) . Section 91 ( 27 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 establishes the sole jurisdiction of Parliament over criminal law in Canada . The Criminal Code contains some defences , but most are part of the common law rather than statute . Important Canadian criminal laws not forming part of the code include the Firearms Act , the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , the Canada Evidence Act , the Food and Drugs Act , the Youth Criminal Justice Act and the Contraventions Act . - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - The Constitution Act, 1867 (originally enacted as The British North America Act, 1867, and referred to as the BNA Act), is a major part of Canada's Constitution. The Act created a federal dominion and defines much of the operation of the Government of Canada, including its federal structure, the House of Commons, the Senate, the justice system, and the taxation system. The British North America Acts, including this Act, were renamed in 1982 with the patriation of the Constitution (originally enacted by the British Parliament); however, it is still known by its original name in United Kingdom records. Amendments were also made at this time: section 92A was added, giving provinces greater control over non-renewable natural resources. - The British North America Acts 18671975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada. They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada. In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982. The rest were renamed in Canada as the \\"Constitution Acts\\". In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.

Tom Leonard. PUBLISHED:. 19:14 EST, 14 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:00 EST, 15 March 2013. The first Latin American Pope may have been a Latin Lover first it emerged last night after a childhood sweetheart claimed she may have driven him into the church. Amalia Damonte, 76, who grew up in the same Flores neighbourhood of Buenos Aires as Bergoglio said she was shocked when he became Pope. 'I froze in front of the television. I couldn’t believe that Jorge was the Pope!' said his old girlfriend, now a white-hair pensioner with spectacles. Scroll down for video. Amalia Damonte, who Pope Francis proposed to as a 12-year-old. They were childhood sweethearts in Buenos Aires. It was either 1948 or 1949 when the future Pope wrote her a letter declaring he would like to marry her. 'We were 12, 13 years old. No more than that,' she said. 'He was wonderful. He was a proper guy.' 'There was only one letter and it cost me a smack in the face from my father,' she said. Pope Francis celebrates his inaugural Mass with cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican yesterday. The Pope used to play on the streets with Amalia and proposed marriage in letter at 12. Bergoglio decided to take religious orders in 1958 when he was 21 but he wasn't ordained until 1969. Today at 11:00am in the Clementine Hall he will meet with the full College of Cardinals, electors and non-electors, in the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace. On Saturday at 11:00am in the Paul VI Hall, the Pope will hold an audience with accredited journalists (permanent and temporary) and those who work in the media. On Sunday, 17 March at 12:00pm, he will recite the first Angelus of his papacy from the papal apartments overlooking St. Peter's Square, as is customary. 'It said we were going to get married and I am going to buy you a white house. So the two of us could live together.' 'He said that if I didn’t say yes, he. would have to become a priest. Luckily for him, I said no!' said Ms. Damonte, who stills lives four doors up from Bergoglio's childhood home. 'He had a crush on me, you know. We. used to play on the streets here. It was a quiet neighbourhood then,. and, well, he was very nice.' She said she the he 'is a good man, the son of a working-class family,' she said. 'I hope he can achieve all the good that he holds in his heart.' It is quite possible that Ms Damonte wasn’t the only love in his life, despite what the future Pope told her. In a 2010 interview, he admitted he. had a girlfriend with whom he loved to dance the tango - probably not a. pastime for a 12-year-old. He said: ‘She was one of a group of friends with whom I used to go dancing with. ‘Then I discovered my religious vocation’. Bergoglio decided to take religious orders in 1958 when he was 21 but he wasn’t ordained until 1969. Youth: Jorge Mario Bergoglio (right) posing with two school teammates at the Technical School in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In this undated picture Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, second from left in back row, poses for a picture with his famil. This early 1950s picture released by journalist Sergio Rubin shows Jorge Mario Bergoglio posing with unidentified schoolmates of a preparatory school in Buenos Aires. He was born into a middle-class family of seven in 1936, his father a railway worker and his mother a housewife. He became a priest at 32, nearly a decade after losing a lung due to respiratory illness and quitting his chemistry studies. Despite his late start, he was leading the local Jesuit community within four years, holding the post from 1973 to 1979. The new Pope is an ardent fan of an Argentinian football team nicknamed the 'Saints.' Just in case their rivals were in any doubt, the club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, tweeted a photo of Pope Francis with the team's colours yesterday. The Buenos Aires club - one of the country's top sides - owes its name to a Catholic priest who played a key role in helping the 104-year-old team find a place to play in its early days. Father Lorenzo Massa became so worried about the boys kicking a ball around in the streets he offered them the use of the churchyard after seeing one player almost knocked down by a tram. There was just one condition - that they must attend mass on Sundays. In honour of his contribution, the founding members of the club decided to name the team after the churchman. Almagro is the district in Buenos Aires where the team originated from. The club now plays in the Primera Division, the top league in Argentina. The former home of the father of Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Portacomaro Stazione, Asti. The villa is tucked away among the vineyards in the gentle rolling hills of northern Italy. Highlights:","completion":"1. The first Latin American Pope, whose name is Jorge and was known as Bergoglio when he was young, might have been in love before he decided to join the church. 2. His childhood friend, Amalia, who is now 76 years old, was very surprised when she saw him becoming a Pope on the TV. 3. When they were kids, around 12 or 13 years old, Jorge wrote a letter to Amalia saying he wanted to marry her and live in a white house together. 4. But Amalia said no to him and he later decided to become a priest when he was 21 years old. 5. Jorge was officially made a priest in 1969, and he later became Pope.

Jorge once mentioned in an interview that he liked to dance the tango with a girlfriend when he was younger, before he decided to join the church. 8. Jorge was from a regular working-class family with seven members. His Dad worked on the railway and his Mom was a housewife. 9.

It's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. Those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think. Then we've got twists like this film has. Twists that, whether or not you pay attention, you have no clue what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. This film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist. Three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods, and hit a tree trunk. They end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher. This film is too caught up in it's dialogue, and it's always between only a few characters. We have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing). Plot holes are abundant here. The house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! A two hour or less walk will kill them. Why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? Did he have a one seater? How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? Why did this have to have so many dumb twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script. Having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely out there, but undoubtedly dumb.

Trivia question: According to the New Testament, shortly after the resurrection Jesus appeared to two disciples and took supper with them at which town north of Jerusalem?

According to the New Testament, shortly after the resurrection, Jesus appeared to two disciples and took supper with them at the town of Emmaus, which is located north of Jerusalem. This story can be found in the Gospel of Luke, in chapter 24, verses 13-35. The two disciples were traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection, discussing the recent events that had taken place. As they walked, Jesus joined them, but they did not recognize him at first. Jesus asked them about their conversation, and they recounted the crucifixion and the report of Jesus' empty tomb. Jesus then began to interpret the Scriptures for them, explaining the prophecies concerning the Messiah and how they had been fulfilled. As they reached Emmaus, the disciples urged the stranger (Jesus) to stay with them, as it was getting late. At supper, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples. At that moment, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him as Jesus. However, he vanished from their sight immediately. The disciples, astonished by the encounter, returned to Jerusalem to share their experience with the other apostles. This event is known as the \\"Road to Emmaus\\" and is commemorated in Christian liturgy and art. It carries a message of hope, as well as an invitation for all believers to recognize Jesus' presence in their lives, especially through the breaking of bread, which later became a central part of Christian worship in the form of the Eucharist or Holy Communion."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians' recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \\"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \\"wearied brain tissue\\". Children and \\"clever\\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \\"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\\" the authors write.

Translate to French","completion":"La table des matières pour cette séance est donnée à la fin du compte rendu in extenso. Let's break down how this English phrase is translated into French: 1. \\"The contents page\\" - This is translated to \\"La table des matières\\". In French, a table of contents in a book or document is often referred to as \\"la table des matières\\". 'La' is the definite article equivalent to 'the' in English, 'table' means table, 'des' is a preposition that can be translated as 'of the' in this context, and 'matières' translates into 'matters' or 'subjects' but in the context of a book or a document, it refers to the topics or chapters, hence 'contents'. 2. \\"for this sitting\\" - This phrase is translated to \\"pour cette séance\\". 'Pour' is the French word for 'for', 'cette' is a demonstrative adjective meaning 'this' and 'séance' is a feminine noun meaning 'sitting' which can refer to a period of time spent doing a particular activity, often in a formal or organized way as in a meeting or a session. 3. \\"is given\\" - The translation in French would be \\"est donnée\\". 'Est' is the third person singular form of the verb 'être' (to be) in the present tense. 'Donnée' is the female singular form of the participle past of the verb 'donner' (to give) referring to 'la table des matières' which is feminine. 4. \\"at the end\\" - This phrase translates to \\"à la fin\\". 'À' is the French word for 'at', 'la' is the definite article 'the' and 'fin' translates into 'end'. 5. \\"of the verbatim report\\" - This is translated to \\"du compte rendu in extenso\\". 'Du' is a contraction of the preposition 'de' ('of') and the definite article 'le' ('the') and is used before masculine singular nouns. 'Compte rendu' is a masculine noun meaning 'report' and 'in extenso' is a Latin phrase used in French to mean 'in full' or 'verbatim'. Therefore, 'du compte rendu in extenso' translates into 'of the verbatim report'. Therefore, the translation of \\"The contents page for this sitting is given at the end of the verbatim report.\\" into French is \\"La table des matières pour cette séance est donnée à la fin du compte rendu in extenso.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: \\"This is just the first stage in an opening up of the Tube network to become 24 hours. \\"For 150 years, the Tube has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks providing the arteries that have transported millions of people and helped to drive the development and economic growth of our great city.\\" But are others equally as positive? No matter how this is dressed up by Boris Johnson and his officials, today's announcement is all about slashing almost Â£250 million from the annual London transport budget and the proposed cuts will decimate staffing levels and hit the most vulnerable users of Tube services the hardest. \\"RMT's position remains the same. We will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action, later today. FSB London welcomes the new 24 hours Tube service at weekends and improvements to the reliability, capacity and accessibility of Tube services. London is a 24-hr international city and it should have a transport infrastructure to support the night time small business economy. However, whilst the 24-hour Tube service is a much-needed step forward, more needs to be done to address the problem of road congestion and the state of repair of roads in London. We are horrified at London Underground's dangerous plans to cut staff from Tube stations. Thousands of disabled and older passengers rely on station staff to help us travel safely and independently. Many of us - particularly visually impaired people and those with a learning impairment - simply cannot use ticket machines. When we first established the West End Commission at the start of this year, one of the major recommendations that came through was to run the Tube at later times at the weekend. We are delighted that our work with businesses, Peter Hendy, and the TfL team has now made that a reality. The West End Partnership may be in its infancy but we are already getting results that will benefit the entire West End of London. Later tubes = great. Closure of all ticket offices?! Idiocy of the highest order. London is a modern, global city and it is only right that we should have a transport system that reflects this. We support the work that TfL has done in putting in place plans to extend the Tube which will further help us compete with other major cities. The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the people of London. As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted.","completion":"London Mayor Boris Johnson's announcement of a 24-hour Tube service on weekends has been met with mixed reactions, with some welcoming the move for supporting the night time economy while others criticize it for cutting staff and impacting vulnerable passengers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Strangled to death Answer:","completion":"Title: The Whispering Strings Logline: Gianni, a renowned but secret criminal underworld violinist, finds himself entangled in a web of lies, deceit, and betrayal when a prized violin's whispered secrets lead to his ultimate demise. Plot: The film opens in a beautiful, old Italian villa outside Rome where we find Gianni practicing his beloved violin with unparalleled passion. However, the story quickly takes a sinister turn as the violin hums a secret melody that only a select few, including Gianni, know to be a message from the criminal underworld. The message reveals a vital meeting that will occur later that evening. Desperate to keep his true identity hidden, Gianni conspires with his trusted confidante, Marcello, to forge a false alibi for his whereabouts tonight. As the night unfolds, the mysterious meeting divulges an elaborate plan to steal a priceless violin known as 'The Whispering Strings', rumored to contain hidden secrets capable of altering the balance of power in the criminal world. Gianni, fascinated by the legend, decides to go against his associates and intercept the theft to possess the rare violin himself. With the help of a cunning thief named Sofia, they successfully steal the violin right under the noses of their criminal comrades. As word spreads about the missing violin, so do rumors about Gianni's betrayal. Struggling to return to his normal life, he becomes consumed by the violin's mesmerizing whispers. Unbeknownst to him, Marcello, fearing the whispers' tantalizing allure, devises a plan to reclaim the violin, even if it means sacrificing Gianni's life. As the pressure of being discovered as the mastermind behind the heist builds and rifts amongst Gianni's underworld peers grow increasingly dark, Marcello manipulates Sofia into discovering Gianni and the Whispering Strings. In a twisted act of treachery, she reveals Gianni's whereabouts to Marcello and their associates. In the film's horrifying climax, Gianni becomes the orchestrator of his own demise when he plays a chilling swan song on the Whispering Strings, accidentally unraveling the final secret held within the instrument - instructions on how to strangle a man. Unbeknownst to him, his betrayers stand nearby, listening intently.

The Whispering Strings fall silent as Gianni takes his final breath. The film concludes with Marcello gaining possession of the violin, only to realize that the very betrayal he orchestrated led not to ultimate power, but to the tragic loss of the one man who truly understood the agony behind the instrument's melodious whispers. The film's haunting, melancholic score echoes as the screen fades to black, leaving audiences captivated and distraught."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As a huge fan of horror films, especially J-horror and also gore i thought Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying, and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? The acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it. I did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light, they left both pretty unexplained, or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn't understand what i was actually seeing. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing?)certainly were, i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way, they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends, but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value, but don't be expecting a dark, deeply scary and horrifying film; you'll just be disappointed. If this was a horror comedy/spoof i'd probably rate it about a nine, the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife's stomach and closed up her wounds, but as a horror sadly i gave it a one.

Summarize the following: Sit in the driver’s seat and step down hard on the clutch pedal a few times. When you press down on the pedal, it should move smoothly and spring up right each time. If you’re having a hard time moving the pedal with any consistency, then the clutch fluid level has likely run low. It could also be from air getting into the clutch fluid reservoir. The fluid lubricates the clutch so it responds when you use it to control the car’s speed. Without it, the mechanical components wear out at a much faster rate. Air bubbles prevent the clutch from engaging properly and are often caused by leaks. If you have replaced the clutch fluid recently, that could also cause air to get into the reservoir. Starting with the car in first gear, press down on the clutch to build up speed. Press it again when the engine reaches about 2,000 RPM and shift into second gear. Watch for anything out of the ordinary, such as the vehicle lurching, a stuck clutch, or a grinding noise. Visit a mechanic right away to solve most of these problems. For something like a stuck clutch, check the fluid level first. A drained reservoir will prevent the clutch from working. Transmission problems are very serious and difficult to repair at home. Don’t ignore signs like grinding gears or a clutch that won’t work at all. . Fresh clutch fluid has a clear yellow coloring. It darkens, turning red or black, over time. If the fluid looks dirty, bleed it from the clutch valve underneath your vehicle. If it still looks clear, simply top off the reservoir tank as needed with new fluid. Bleeding the valve requires you to jack up the vehicle’s front end and get under it. Once you find the valve, you attach a rubber hose to it and press the clutch to drive out the fluid. However, keep the tank full by adding new fluid after every couple of presses. If you’re uncertain about doing this on your own, contact a mechanic to have them deal with the clutch fluid. Jacking up a car is dangerous when it isn’t done properly. Like any other car parts, the components responsible for operating the clutch wear out over time. Open the engine bay and examine the clutch fluid reservoir. Have a friend press the clutch pedal down while you keep an eye on the fluid level. Check the reservoir tank and the parts around it for leaked fluid. If you notice a leak, get an identical replacement part or take the vehicle to a professional right away. You may not notice small leaks right away. One easy way to spot hidden leaks is by noting the fluid level, then checking it again after several days. If it has changed by a noticeable amount, then your vehicle needs repairs. The slave cylinder is a small component located above the transmission on your engine. To find it, follow the cables running from the clutch reservoir to the engine. Have a friend press the clutch pedal a few times while you watch for the slave cylinder to move. Check it for leaks or bubbles as well. If the cylinder doesn’t move, it has to be replaced. Take the vehicle to a mechanic. Leaks can be fixed by replacing parts. Have a mechanic do it if you are unable to do it on your own. If you do it on your own, you will need to bleed out the clutch valve afterward. Summary:","completion":"To check and maintain your vehicle's clutch, start by sitting in the driver's seat and pressing the clutch pedal a few times, ensuring it moves smoothly and springs back consistently. Difficulty in doing so might indicate low clutch fluid levels or air in the reservoir. The clutch fluid is essential for lubricating the components and preventing premature wear. Regularly examine the fluid reservoir, checking for any leaks and the fluid's color, as darkened fluid should be replaced. To bleed the fluid, safely jack up the vehicle's front end and attach a rubber hose to the clutch valve. Press the clutch to drive out the fluid, adding new fluid to the tank between presses. If uncertain about this process, seek assistance from a mechanic. Remember to inspect the slave cylinder for leaks or bubbles and ensure it moves when the clutch pedal is pressed. If it doesn't move, replace it at a mechanic. Address any leaks by replacing parts or seeking professional help. After fixing the issues, bleed the clutch valve to ensure your vehicle's clutch operates optimally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive. The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy. Psychologist, Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when workers were dealing with clients could backfire . He said:\\"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.\\" Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who\\"faked smiles\\"throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped. He added:\\"Bosses may think that getting their staff to smile is good for the organization, but that's not necessarily the case.\\"Dr. Scott, assistant professor of management at Michigan State University, analyzed a group of bus drivers during a two -week period.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation 526*i = 382*i - 1440 for i, we first need to isolate the variable i. We can start by moving all the terms containing i to one side of the equation and the constant term to the opposite side. Here's how we can do it step by step: 1. Subtract 382*i from both sides of the equation: 526*i - 382*i = 382*i - 382*i - 1440 2. Simplify: 144*i = -1440 3. Now we need to isolate i by dividing both sides by 144: i = -1440 / 144 4.

Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected.

This will help the child follow along and know what to expect as you progress. 3. Teach the child the prayers: If the child is old enough and unfamiliar with the prayers, take time to teach them the basic prayers used throughout the Rosary, such as the Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, and Fatima Prayer. 4. Choose a set of Mysteries: Select one of the four sets of Mysteries to meditate on during the Rosary - the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, or Glorious Mysteries. Share with the child a brief description of each event related to the chosen Mysteries. 5. Begin praying the Rosary together: Start with the Sign of the Cross, followed by the Apostles' Creed, then an Our Father, three Hail Marys, and a Glory Be. After that, announce the first Mystery and begin praying the first decade. 6. Maintain a comfortable pace and involve the child throughout the process: As you continue to pray the Rosary, ensure that the pace is suited for the child and that you make it interactive for them. Encourage the child to participate by leading some prayers, announcing Mysteries, or even reciting prayers from memory. You can also incorporate the use of visuals or storytelling to help the child better understand the events of the Mysteries. 7.

Unwind any old line left over by spinning the handle. Close-faced and Spincast are different names for the same reel. You’ll know you have one if it has this cover you need to unscrew to reach the reel’s spool. Look for the small rings hanging off the bottom of the rod. Starting at the rod’s tip, run the new line through the holes towards the reel. Pick up the cap and run the line through the hole in the top. If you don’t do this now, you won’t be able to get the cap on later when you need it. Don’t attach the cap to the rest of the reel yet. Like with the other types of rods, the rod’s spool will have a small hollow in the middle where the line rests. Wrap it around this hollow twice so that you’ll have enough to line to tie in place. Always make sure the line goes on the same way the reel rotates. If it rotates clockwise, the line should be wrapped around it counterclockwise. The direction of the rotation depends on the fishing pole. Knot it against the reel so the line doesn’t come undone. You can do this with a slip knot, clinch knot, or arbor knot. Make sure the line is securely tied and tight before you move on. Use your free hand to apply a light amount of pressure on the line as you spool it onto the reel. This will keep the line tense, preventing it from tangling. Hold the line taut between your thumb and index finger, applying a little bit of pressure to keep the line straight. Turn the handle in the same direction you loaded the line, which should have been the same direction the reel normally rotates to unspool the line. For example, if you spooled the line counterclockwise, crank the handle counterclockwise. Load the line, but don’t fill the reel completely. The line should be about 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) below the spool's rim. The line should hang from the rest of the rod with no slack. Adding too much can make the line come undone, so you’ll have to spool it all over again. Grab the reel’s cover, which should have already been threaded with the new line. Twist it clockwise onto the reel to secure it in place. If you left the cover off, unwind all of the thread. You’ll need a lot of space for this, so try walking around and hanging the line on fences or other objects so it stays untangled. Then spool the line through the cover and onto the reel. Go back to the tip of the rod. Get a pair of scissors and snip the line beyond the tip’s end. Avoid clipping the line that’s hanging from the line guides under the rod. Summary:","completion":"This article is about changing the line on a fishing reel. First, remove the reel's top part by twisting it counterclockwise. Then, take off any old line and put the new line through the holes on the rod, starting from the tip. Put the line through the cap's hole, and wrap it around the spool. Make sure the line goes the same way the reel rotates and tie a knot. Keep the line tight as you spool it and stop when it's about 1/8 inch below the spool's rim. Finally, put the cover back on, unwind any extra thread, and cut the line beyond the rod's tip."},{"prompt":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Can you tell me the answer to how many french soldiers were killed in ww1??","completion":"During World War I (1914-1918), France was one of the major countries involved, fighting against the Central Powers, primarily Germany. Due to the significant role France played in the war, the number of French soldiers killed was substantial. Official records state that approximately 1.4 million French soldiers were killed during World War I. However, it is important to note that such statistics may not account for every single soldier, and the precise number could fluctuate. The deaths of French soldiers throughout the war were the result of various factors, including combat, disease, injuries sustained, and other war-related causes. Among these deaths, many young men from France lost their lives, leading to a considerable impact on the country's population. In addition to the French soldiers who lost their lives, around 4.2 million of them were wounded. These figures highlight the immense human cost France bore as a result of the war. The high number of casualties led to a significant shift in the demographics of the country and deeply impacted the lives of the families left behind. World War I, sometimes referred to as the Great War, was one of the deadliest conflicts in history. As a whole, it led to the deaths of around 16 million people, including both military personnel and civilians. The aftermath of the war profoundly altered the global political landscape and significantly changed the way wars were fought, with lessons learned on tactics, strategies, and the need to avoid a similar catastrophic conflict in the future. The heavy death toll and suffering of the French population led to a profound sense of loss and mourning. The war left an indelible mark on the country's collective memory and led to various forms of remembrance, such as memorial days, statues, and monuments to honor the fallen soldiers and their sacrifices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have 0 = -17*o - 840 + 1095. First, let's add 840 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 840 = -17*o - 840 + 840 + 1095. We get 840 = -17*o + 1095. Now, let's subtract 1095 from both sides: 840 - 1095 = -17*o + 1095 - 1095. We get -255 = -17*o. Now, we need to find the value of 'o'. To do this, let's divide both sides by -17: (-255) / (-17) = (-17*o) / (-17). We find that o = 15. So the answer for 'o' is 15! Hurray! We solved the puzzle!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The story began with endless possibilities that were introduced but never brought to fruition - including the ending. I have never read a novel with so many unfinished subplots - incomplete and unfulfilled relationships (Ginger and Ruben, Stacy and Danny); the murderer left undiscovered to murder and commit incest again with his spouse having full knowledge; the ruination of the Frankel family also with no closure; the anti-Semite group headed by Kyle Breckenridge; no to mention the ambiguous role of Mr. Purdy. The only winner here is the author Ms. Sloan, who seems to have pulled the wool over the eyes of we fools who purchased her book.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, this product review is decidedly negative. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the novel, stating that they would have given it \\"0\\" stars if possible. The main issues highlighted by the reviewer include numerous unresolved subplots, a lack of closure for the various storylines, and the overall feeling that the author has \\"shortchanged\\" her readers by not fully developing the narrative or delivering on the story's potential. The reviewer lists several specific examples of incomplete and unfulfilled relationships (such as Ginger and Ruben, and Stacy and Danny) and other storylines that were left hanging and unresolved, such as the anti-Semitic group headed by Kyle Breckenridge, the ambiguous role of Mr. Purdy, the murderer remaining undetected, and the decimation of the Frankel family. The disappointment and dissatisfaction in the review are palpable as the reviewer questions whether the author has intentionally deceived her readership by not providing a satisfying and cohesive story. They emphasize that they feel like \\"fools who purchased her book,\\" concluding that they won't make the same mistake again when it comes to the author's future works.

It was the first Gable-Crawford pairing, and made it evident to MGM and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars. The film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must fend for themselves and work for a living. Life is hard in the Depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity. Joan Crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll. She's smart, complex, and believable. She even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early Talkie acting style. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with Crawford's character.

After selecting the seeds, gather all necessary gardening tools, such as a shovel, rake, hoe, watering can or hose, gloves, and any additional materials like compost, fertilizer, or plant food. Once you have chosen the seeds and assembled the tools, you can proceed with the following steps: 1. Pick a spot to plant them: Choose a location in your garden or planting area that meets the specific sunlight, soil, and watering requirements of the plants you have chosen. 2. Dig a hole in the dirt: Using a hand trowel or shovel, dig a hole suited to the size of the seeds you are planting. The hole should be deep and wide enough for the seeds to have ample space to grow roots and sprout. 3. Put the seed in the hole: Gently place the seed in the center of the hole, making sure it lies flat and is correctly positioned according to its planting depth requirements. 4. Pour some water on the seed and hole: Water the seed and the surrounding soil to moisten it and help the seed settle into its new environment. Ensure not to overwater and flood the hole, as this can hinder proper seed germination. 5. Cover up the hole: Carefully fill the hole back in with soil, being cautious not to overly compact the soil, as this could prevent the seedling from pushing through the surface. 6. Press down on it: Gently press down on the soil to ensure that there is a proper contact between the seed and the soil, which will aid in germination. 7. Spray some plant food on it: Apply an appropriate plant food or fertilizer to the planting area, following the specific product's instructions and recommended application rates. This will provide vital nutrients to support the growth and development of your new plants. Remember that after completing this planting process, it is crucial to keep a consistent watering schedule and monitor the plants for any signs of pests or disease.

The bird has green, orange, blue, red, yellow, purple and grey colors on its body. Rainbow lorikeets are small birds. They are usually 11 to 12 inches long and weigh 120g to 140g. It is said that they can live for over 20 years in the wild. They usually live in groups. At night, they sleep in the trees in a big group. But during the daytime, they move in much smaller groups (about 20 birds). Late in the evening, you can sometimes see a larger group flying back home. These birds spend a lot of time looking for food. Most of their food comes from trees, like flowers, nuts and fruit. But sometimes they eat insects. They can get water from the leaves that they eat or drink water directly. Rainbow lorikeets usually start to have families when they are around two years old.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - arousal - disease - sweet - halatosis - cooties The answer to this question is:","completion":"cooties. Little Sarah's notion that boys have \\"cooties\\" is a common childhood belief that often originates from playground conversations and the idea that boys and girls are fundamentally different. This playful and innocent perception tends to arise during early childhood when children are just beginning to socialize and interact with their peers. At this age, they are also developing their understanding of gender, relationships, and physical affection. The term \\"cooties\\" is a slang word that has been used for generations to describe an imaginary and contagious ailment that is attributed to people — usually, those of the opposite gender — as a means of rationalizing their hesitancy to associate with them. This concept often causes children to play separately from one another, and the idea of cooties is sometimes employed as a teasing taunt. The other options, such as arousal, disease, sweet, and halatosis, are not as fitting in this context because they do not embody the distinctive childlike innocence that the presence of cooties does. Arousal and disease are mature concepts that young children like little Sarah are unlikely to grasp or even think about in their interactions. Sweet is an inapplicable adjective in this context, as it does not explain why Sarah would not want to kiss boys. And while halatosis (bad breath) could be a valid reason, it would generally not be a primary concern for young children who are generally unaware of such specifics. In conclusion, the notion of boys having cooties is a harmless and age-appropriate way for little Sarah to express her reservations about kissing boys — highlighting the childlike innocence and playful distancing that is normal for children as they explore gender roles and relationships at a young age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to Sahih al-Bukhari, the Quran was recited among Levantines and Iraqis, and discussed by Christians and Jews, before it was standardized. Its language was similar to the Syriac language.[citation needed] The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament.

Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do devout Muslims believe is the reason for no overlap of events and characters in the Bible and Quran?","completion":"Devout Muslims believe that the overlap of events and characters in the Bible and the Quran is due to their common divine source, which is God (Allah). According to Islamic teaching, both the Bible and the Quran are part of a series of divine revelations sent by God to guide humanity. Throughout history, God has sent various prophets to deliver His message, and many of these prophets are mentioned in both the Bible and the Quran. However, it is important to note that while there is significant overlap, there are also differences in the details and interpretations of these events and characters between the two scriptures. Muslims believe that these differences are mainly due to the corruption and alteration of earlier revealed scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible. They hold that over time, these texts have been changed by humans, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. In this context, the Quran is viewed as the final, perfect, and unaltered revelation from God, carrying the ultimate truth and correcting the inaccuracies found in previous scriptures. The Quran addresses many of the same events and characters as the Bible, but often provides different perspectives or additional information to clarify misconceptions or skewed interpretations that might have arisen because of human interference with earlier texts. Thus, devout Muslims believe that the overlap of events and characters in the Bible and the Quran is a testament to their common divine origin, while the differences are a result of human alterations to the original revelations. The Quran is seen as the ultimate source of truth that resolves any discrepancies and provides a more accurate account of both their shared and unique events and characters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available options: I. No. II. Yes. A:","completion":"I. No. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"Who makes BlackBerry?\\" would be as follows: BlackBerry is a brand of smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices. It was originally developed and manufactured by the Canadian company, Research In Motion (RIM). RIM was founded in 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin, and its headquarters are located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Over the years, RIM became internationally recognized for its BlackBerry line of products, which gained significant popularity, particularly in the business and corporate sectors due to their secure email and messaging services, as well as strong data security features. The first BlackBerry device, an email pager, was introduced in 1999. However, it was the release of the first BlackBerry smartphone in 2003 with a built-in phone, email, and web browser that changed the mobile landscape. In 2013, the company underwent a rebranding, changing its name from Research In Motion Limited (RIM) to BlackBerry Limited to emphasize its focus on the BlackBerry brand. In 2016, BlackBerry shifted away from in-house hardware development and began relying on partners to manufacture and distribute its devices. As part of this transition, BlackBerry signed licensing agreements with several hardware manufacturers, including TCL Communication, Optiemus Infracom, and BB Merah Putih. The statement \\"In 2011, the Caribbean and Latin America had the highest penetrations of BlackBerry smartphones worldwide, with up to about 45 per cent in the region having a RIM device\\" provides valuable historical context about the company's market presence, but it does not accurately answer the question of who makes BlackBerry devices.

Question: suppose Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The process you've mentioned pertains to physical weathering, specifically freeze-thaw weathering and thermal expansion and contraction, the general weathering actions that the natural environment imposes on rocks. The task - \\"Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use\\" - is a household action that likely wouldn't have any direct effect on the rate or intensity of physical weathering happening on rocks. Let's break it down. 1. Water Seeping into Rocks: This is an entirely natural process contingent upon precipitation, humidity, and rock permeability. Loading dishes into a dishwasher doesn't create more rainfall or increase the water in an outdoor setting in a way that can increase water's capabilities to infiltrate into rocks. 2. The Water Freezes and Thaws: This is dependent on temperature cycles and not on human domestic actions such as cleaning dishes. Unless an individual is somehow manipulating outdoor temperatures in the rock's immediate environment, this process is largely beyond human control. 3. Cracks Form in the Rocks: Again, this is a result of natural physical weathering processes which are not affected by loading dishes into a dishwasher. 4. Cracks Also Form When Rocks Heat Up: Thermal expansion happens due to natural daily temperature fluctuations and is not impacted by household tasks. 5. The Rocks Slowly Break Down: The breakdown of rocks is a long-term geological process. Loading dishes into a dishwasher does not accelerate or decelerate this. To sum it all up, the action of loading dishes directly into a dishwasher after use has no effect on weathering occurring more or faster. The processes of weathering are natural geological occurrences that are impacted by environmental conditions such as climatic changes, temperature fluctuations, and natural erosional agents. They are not influenced by human domestic activities such as dishwashing. So, the supposed perturbation does not influence the second effect mentioned, that is, the freeze and thaw action of water in rocks. The two actions exist in completely separate domains – one being an indoor, domestic activity and the other being an external, geological event. Monitoring and manipulating the factors that actually affect weathering – like climate, type of rock, and surrounding vegetation, can make a genuine difference in its progress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the following context: Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior.

Q:I read this background article the other day: In the study of thermochemical processes, things are viewed from the point of view of the system. A chemical reaction or physical change is endothermic if heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings. In the course of an endothermic process, the system gains heat from the surroundings and so the temperature of the surroundings decreases. The quantity of heat for a process is represented by the letter . The sign of for an endothermic process is positive because the system is gaining heat. A chemical reaction or physical change is exothermic if heat is released by the system into the surroundings. Because the surroundings is gaining heat from the system, the temperature of the surroundings increases. The sign of for an exothermic process is negative because the system is losing heat. I am facing a new situation today: Calving is sitting in his kitchen when he decides to play around with some ice and water. He takes an ice cube out of the freezer and puts it on a plate on his kitchen table. He then takes a glass of water and puts it into the freezer. He is curious to see if the ice cube will melt before the water freezes. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is the water freezing an exothermic or endothermic reaction? A:","completion":"The water freezing is an exothermic reaction. This is because as water freezes and turns into ice, it releases heat into its surroundings. In an exothermic process, the system (in this case, water) loses heat, which results in a negative value for the heat quantity (q). As a consequence, the temperature of the surroundings (e.g., the air inside the freezer) will increase as the released heat energy is absorbed by the surroundings."},{"prompt":"\\"Antimena chameleon\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

It consists of about 7000 lines in the so - called political verse . It obtained great popularity and appeared in a free prose translation ; it was also translated into Bulgarian and Roman Slavic in the 14th century and enjoyed a great popularity .

Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian , and some descriptive pieces ( all except one unpublished ) on artistic and other subjects . - The Komnenian Restoration is the term used by historians to describe the military, financial, and territorial recovery of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian dynasty, from the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 to the death of Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. At the onset of the reign of Alexios I, the empire was reeling from its defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The empire was also being threatened by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who were invading the Balkans from their base in southern Italy. All this occurred as the empire's military institution was in disarray and had grown increasingly reliant on mercenaries. Previous emperors had also squandered the large gold deposits of Constantinople, so the defense of the empire had broken down, and there were few troops to fill the gaps. - Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus \\"Manoul I Komnnos\\"; 28 November 1118 24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean.

The characters in Aaron's novel were more unique than Kyle's because","completion":"the intricacies and complex backgrounds of each individual were carefully woven into their personalities, bringing forth connections and conflicts that made the story more engaging and emotionally resonant. In Aaron's novel, every character had a distinct voice, a result of the author's meticulous crafting of their personal histories, desires, fears, and aspirations. These characters were not merely archetypes or stereotypes, but rather multi-dimensional beings that came to life in the readers' minds as they embarked on their respective journeys throughout the narrative. The author managed to capture the essence of human emotion and experience in his characters, making it easier for readers to relate to and empathize with them. For example, the protagonist of Aaron's novel, Emma, was a fiercely independent and headstrong young woman who gradually uncovered a hidden vulnerability as her personal struggles and challenges were brought to light. This rich exploration into Emma's character not only made her journey throughout the story more engaging, but it fostered a sense of attachment for the reader, who became genuinely invested in her emotional growth and well-being. On the other hand, the secondary characters in Aaron's novel were just as thoughtfully developed, each with their unique backstories and motivations that contributed to the overall fabric of the plot. The characters' interactions and relationships with one another were complex, sometimes filled with tension and rivalry, creating a dynamic, believable universe that drew the reader deeper into the story. In contrast, Kyle's novel, while entertaining and well-written, did not achieve the same level of intricate character development. The characters in his story tended to fall into recognizable tropes or categories, making them appear somewhat two-dimensional and predictable. This limited the reader's ability to deeply relate to the characters, ultimately detracting from the overall impact of the story. Furthermore, the relationships and interactions between the characters in Kyle's novel were less nuanced, often boiling down to superficial bonds or straightforward conflicts that resolved quickly. While every story requires some level of conflict, the lack of layered connections and complexities between characters in Kyle's novel made the events feel more contrived and less engaging. Ultimately, it was the well-crafted, multifaceted characters in Aaron's novel that set it apart from Kyle's. The attention to detail and dedication to exploring the complexities of human emotion and experience made the characters in Aaron's novel feel more authentic and relatable, capturing the reader's imagination and eliciting a genuine investment in their well-being and personal journeys. By developing characters that resonated on such an intimate level, Aaron succeeded in crafting a unique, memorable narrative that surpassed the boundaries of convention and left a lasting impression on all who read it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Six years later, the film introduces Liz Reynolds, a young woman whose psychic bond to Mike and the Tall Man manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him. Mike, who has been institutionalized after the events of the first film, fakes his recovery to make contact with Liz. When Mike returns to Morningside Cemetery to exhume the bodies of his parents, Reggie interrupts him and explains that the earlier attack never took place. However, Mike reveals the coffins are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt down the Tall Man. En route to Reggie's house, Mike has a premonition and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before an explosion kills Reggie's entire family. Convinced by Mike's futile warning, Reggie agrees to accompany Mike. They break into a hardware store and stock up on supplies and weapons. Traveling country roads, they encounter abandoned towns, pillaged graveyards, and a few of the Tall Man's traps; one is an apparition of a nude, deceased young woman. The clues lead them to PÃ©rigord, Oregon. Meanwhile, Liz's grandfather dies, and her sister Jeri disappears during the funeral; while searching for Jeri, Liz finds the Tall Man and flees.

Czech:","completion":"Proč se sakra nevdáš za to dřevěného koně a nezajezdíš si ho do pekla!! Step by step translation: 1. \\"Why don't you\\" - This is a question asking for a reason, so I translated it to \\"Proč ne\\" in Czech. By adding \\"se\\" (reflexive pronoun), we can emphasize the action towards the person, making it \\"proč se ne...?\\" 2. \\"marry\\" - The verb 'to marry' in Czech is \\"vdát se\\" for women and \\"oženit se\\" for men. In this case, since there is no specific gender given, I used the neutral option \\"vdát se\\" which typically refers to a woman, but can sometimes be used more generally. 3. \\"the friggin'\\" - This colloquial slang intensifies the noun following it. Its Czech equivalent is \\"sakra\\" which is a mild curse word, similar to \\"damn\\" or \\"bloody\\" in English. I translated this as \\"za to sakra\\" in order to retain the emphasis on the noun. 4. \\"wooden horse\\" - The noun phrase 'wooden horse' can be translated directly into Czech as \\"dřevěný kůň\\". 5. \\"and\\" - The conjunction 'and' translates to \\"a\\" in Czech. 6. \\"ride it\\" - In Czech, this can be translated as \\"zajezdit si ho\\", which implies that both the action of riding and the object 'it' (the horse) are included. 7. \\"to hell\\" - The expression 'to hell' is commonly used in English to convey a strong negative reaction to something.

Group A used brewer's yeast on flower and tried to make bread. and Group B brewed beer with brewer's yeast, then baked bread with baker's yeast. and a hint : Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. Please answer this question : Which group caused the bread to rise more? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be deduced that Group B caused the bread to rise more. To better understand why, let's first analyze the methods used by the two groups: Group A: They used brewer's yeast on a flower and attempted to make bread. Brewer's yeast, as mentioned, is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the same species as baker's yeast but a different strain. The primary purpose of brewer's yeast is for the fermentation of alcohol in beer production. Though it can contribute to some leavening, it is not specifically optimized for breadmaking. Group B: They brewed beer with brewer's yeast (a normal process), but when they baked bread, they used baker's yeast. Baker's yeast, also Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a strain specifically intended for breadmaking. It is a leavening agent that causes bread to rise by converting fermentable sugars in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast has been selectively bred and cultivated to optimize its bread-rising capabilities. Consequently, it provides superior leavening properties compared to brewer's yeast when used in breadmaking. Even though both strains belong to the same species, the difference in their selection and optimization makes baker's yeast more effective in causing the bread to rise. In conclusion, as Group B used the correct strain of yeast (baker's yeast) for breadmaking, their bread would have risen more compared to Group A's bread, which was made using brewer's yeast, a strain not specifically optimized for breadmaking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who directed the films The Graduate, Silkwood and Primary Colours?","completion":"The acclaimed director responsible for directing the films The Graduate, Silkwood, and Primary Colors is none other than Mike Nichols. Born on November 6, 1931, in Berlin, Germany, and named Mikhail Igor Peschkowsky, he later moved to the United States to escape Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II and eventually became one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history. Mike Nichols began his career as a theatrical performer and eventually transitioned into directing for both stage and screen. His ability to understand and communicate complex human emotions and situations, combined with his keen sense of comedy and drama, contributed to his directorial triumphs in film and theater. The Graduate, released in 1967, is arguably one of Nichols' most celebrated works. The film, starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, is a coming-of-age story about a young man, Benjamin Braddock, who finds himself entangled in a love triangle with an older woman, Mrs. Robinson, and her daughter, Elaine. The Graduate received critical acclaim for its poignant take on disillusionment, love, and confusion that was quite common among the younger generation in the late '60s. Mike Nichols won the Academy Award for Best Director for The Graduate, which was also nominated for six other Oscars. Silkwood, released in 1983, was a biographical drama film that featured Meryl Streep, Kurt Russell, and Cher in the lead roles. The movie is based on the real-life story of Karen Silkwood, a labor union activist who worked at a plutonium-processing plant and died under mysterious circumstances after becoming a whistleblower on dangerous practices and safety violations at the facility. Silkwood was a critical success and received multiple Academy Award nominations, including one for Meryl Streep, who gave a powerful performance in the lead role. The film cemented Nichols' reputation as a master of deeply human stories with a social and political resonance. Primary Colors, released in 1998, is a satirical comedy-drama that delves into the world of electoral campaigns and the dark underbelly of American politics. The film, which is based on a bestselling novel written by Joe Klein, stars John Travolta, Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton among others. It tells the story of a Southern governor, Jack Stanton, whose run for presidency unfolds amid various scandals and betrayals. Primary Colors was appreciated for its blend of humor, engaging storyline, and evocative portrayal of the triumphs and tribulations of working in high-stakes political environments. In summary, Mike Nichols directed the films The Graduate, Silkwood, and Primary Colors. His films often dealt with complex human experiences and relationships, and his directorial prowess earned him recognition and accolades from audiences and critics alike. Nichols passed away on November 19, 2014, leaving behind a rich legacy of work that continues to inspire filmmakers today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Q: Different isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of what? Choices: - protons - electrons - nuclei - neutrons A: The answer is:","completion":"- neutrons Different isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons. To fully understand why, one must understand the basic structure of an atom, and what isotopes are. An atom, the smallest unit of an element, consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons occupy the center of the atom, known as the nucleus, while electrons circle around the nucleus in something called electron shells. The atomic number of an element corresponds to the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This number is key in defining the element; for example, carbon atoms always have 6 protons, oxygen atoms have 8 protons, and so on. The contribution of protons to the atomic mass is significant due to their relative mass. Electrons, while crucial for chemical reactions and electrical charge, have a much smaller mass compared to protons and neutrons. Thus, their contribution to the overall atomic mass is often negligible. Neutrons, like protons, are located in the nucleus of the atom and are about the same mass as a proton. Neutrons are unique because the number of neutrons can vary among atoms of the same element. Which brings us to isotopes. Isotopes are versions of an element that share the same atomic number (the same number of protons) but have different numbers of neutrons. This variation in neutron number results in isotopes having different atomic masses, as the mass number (also known as atomic mass) of an isotope is calculated by adding the number of protons and neutrons together. For example, the most common isotope of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, and is called carbon-12. However, there exists an isotope of carbon, known as carbon-14, which has 6 protons (like all carbon atoms) but 8 neutrons. In summary, all atoms of a given element will have the same number of protons, and generally the same number of electrons, but can have different numbers of neutrons. These different versions, or isotopes, of the same element have different mass numbers due to the variation in the number of neutrons. Thus, isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Бег на средние дистанции Which language is this?","completion":"The given phrase \\"Бег на средние дистанции\\" is in the Russian language. The phrase translates to \\"Middle-distance running\\" in English. Middle-distance running typically refers to track events that range from 800 meters to 5000 meters in length, including popular races such as the 800 meters, 1500 meters, and the 3000-meter steeplechase. These events require a combination of speed, strength, and endurance. Middle-distance races can be quite challenging, as they necessitate athletes to not only have a considerable level of aerobic fitness but also possess the ability to maintain a fast pace throughout the race. Training for middle-distance running typically involves a mix of aerobic and anaerobic workouts, focusing on building both endurance and speed. Some key elements of middle-distance running training include: 1. Aerobic endurance: This is the foundation of any middle-distance training program. Athletes need to develop their cardiovascular fitness through various exercises such as steady runs, long runs, and interval training. 2. Anaerobic capacity: Middle-distance runners need to improve their ability to tolerate and clear lactic acid produced during high-intensity exercise. This can be achieved through high-intensity interval training, tempo runs, and hill sprints. 3. Running economy: Improving running economy means enhancing the efficiency of the body's energy use while running. Activities such as strength training, plyometrics, and drills focused on proper running technique can help improve running economy. 4. Speed development: Middle-distance runners should incorporate speed work into their training to increase their aerobic and anaerobic power. This may involve short sprints, strides, or other speed-focused exercises. 5. Race-specific preparation: Training for a particular race distance should involve specific workouts tailored to the event's demands. For example, an 800-meter runner might focus on 400-meter repeats at their intended race pace, while a 1500-meter runner might target longer intervals with shorter recovery periods. In addition to these physical components, middle-distance runners must also develop mental toughness and race strategy. A strong mental approach can help athletes maintain focus and composure during competitions, while efficient race strategies can enable runners to navigate the pack more effectively and conserve energy for the latter stages of the race. Ultimately, success in middle-distance running requires a balance of physical preparation, mental fortitude, and tactical savvy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: What may be a plausible reason I was staggering on the way to Tina ’s ?","completion":"A plausible reason for you staggering on the way to Tina's could be a combination of factors, including lack of sleep, inadequate nutrition, and dehydration. You mentioned that you went to bed late and had to get up early, which might not have provided enough rest to properly rejuvenate your body and mind. This lack of sleep may have caused fatigue, which could have led to impaired balance and coordination, making it difficult to walk steadily. Additionally, not being able to eat any breakfast and opting for a few Pepsis as your main source of sustenance might have contributed to the staggering. Consuming a high-sugar beverage like Pepsi on an empty stomach can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar, followed by a sudden drop. This fluctuation in blood sugar levels can lead to dizziness, weakness, and sometimes even impaired coordination. Moreover, consuming only soda (which might be the case since you skipped breakfast) can lead to dehydration, as sodas can be diuretics, which means they can increase the production of urine and cause more fluid loss in the body. Dehydration can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and impaired balance, all of which could contribute to the staggering observed. In conclusion, the staggering on the way to Tina's could likely be attributed to a combination of inadequate sleep, poor nutrition, and possible dehydration. These factors can collectively impair your balance and coordination, making it difficult for you to walk steadily and necessitating the need to pull yourself together to appear normal and coherent upon arrival. To avoid such issues in the future, it is essential to prioritize getting adequate sleep, maintaining proper nutrition, and staying well-hydrated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?, using the article: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century., what would be the answer ?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?\\" would be the kingdom of Nobadia, as it was mentioned that the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village.

Given the question: Question: \\"What portion of the Madder Plant was used by Ancient Egyptians in the production of a red dye?\\" Context: \\"But, like many colors, it also had a negative association, with heat, destruction and evil. A prayer to god Isis said: \\"Oh Isis, protect me from all things evil and red.\\" The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC. Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings, particularly as the skin color of men. An ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors. The Egyptians used the root of the rubia, or madder plant, to make a dye, later known as alizarin, and also used it to color white power to use as a pigment, which became known as madder lake, alizarin or alizarin crimson.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The portion of the Madder Plant used by Ancient Egyptians in the production of a red dye was the root. They utilized the root of the Rubia, or Madder plant, to create a dye that later became known as Alizarin. Additionally, they used this dye to color white powder, which they then utilized as a pigment. This pigment was referred to as Madder Lake, Alizarin, or Alizarin Crimson. By extracting color from the Madder plant's root, the Ancient Egyptians were able to produce a vibrant red dye that held significant cultural and artistic value. Despite the color red sometimes being associated with negative connotations such as heat, destruction, and evil, it was still prominently used in various art forms, like wall paintings, particularly for depicting the skin color of men. Artifacts, like the ivory painter's palette discovered inside King Tutankhamun's tomb, further illustrate the importance of red dyes and pigments in Ancient Egyptian art and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them.

Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars.

The place of worship in Nome, North Dakota, was recently purchased by Craig Cobb, who tried to set up a whites-only enclave in another part of the state. The blaze was reported on Wednesday afternoon and the structure was razed by the time fire crews arrived after nearly an hour. Cobb said the fire at the former Zion Lutheran church was \\"100% arson\\". He told WDAY-TV, a Fargo-based news station, that he is offering a reward of 2,000 (Â£1,600) to anyone with any information related to the incident, which he said was a direct attack on his life. Local residents said that it appeared Cobb had not yet moved in the 108-year-old building. He says the gas and electric utilities had not been hooked up, so the fire could not have been accidental. The blaze occurred on the same day that news of the sale appeared on the front page of the Fargo Forum newspaper. The North Dakota State Fire Marshal's Office is helping with the investigation. Cobb told WDAY-TV that he is considering several options about what to do next. He says he might open a new church called \\"the President Donald J Trump Church of Rome\\", not Nome, the town located about 70 miles (112km) southwest of Fargo. Cobb is one of the best known white supremacists in North America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. In 2011, he began buying run-down properties in the tiny town of Leith, just southwest of Bismarck, North Dakota, with the plan of turning it into an Aryan stronghold.

Answer the following question: Question: what causes thunder sound I found the following answer on Google: In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom , which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a clap, crack, or peal of thunder. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. The sound of thunder is caused by the sudden and rapid expansion of air due to the intense heat produced by lightning. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the process involved in the formation of thunder. 1. Formation of lightning: Thunder is a byproduct of lightning, and hence, the formation of thunder is directly related to the process of lightning. Lightning is a massive electrostatic discharge that occurs within a thunderstorm. When there is a significant difference in electrical charges between the ground and the cloud, a lightning flash takes place. This electrical discharge superheats the surrounding air to temperatures around 30,000 Kelvin, or about five times hotter than the surface of the Sun. 2. Rapid expansion of air: Since the air surrounding the lightning bolt is heated to extreme temperatures, it causes the air to expand rapidly. The expansion occurs at a supersonic speed, creating a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. This shock wave compresses the surrounding air, causing it to vibrate and generate a loud, explosive noise. 3. Sound waves travel through the air: The shock wave, which is also a sound wave, travels through the atmosphere at the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and altitude; however, it typically travels at about 1,117 feet (340 meters) per second at sea level and 20°C. As the sound wave travels through the air, it disperses - causing the intensity of the sound to decrease over a distance. 4. Perception of thunder: When the sound wave reaches our ears, we perceive it as the cracking, rumbling, booming noise that we commonly associate with thunder. The different sounds of thunder are a result of numerous factors, including the distance, intensity, and position of the lightning, and the nature of the surrounding environment (e.g., terrain, temperature, humidity, etc.). To summarize, the sound of thunder is caused by the rapid expansion of air due to the intense heat produced by lightning. This expansion generates a sonic shock wave that travels through the atmosphere, creating the familiar sound we associate with thunderstorms.

Choose from: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no;","completion":"[-] it is not possible to tell; Explanation: In the given premise, we learn that there is a man in a beret looking out the window of a vehicle. However, we do not have enough information to determine whether the man is a soldier or not. A beret is a type of hat that is often worn by military personnel, but it is also worn by people in a variety of other professions, and sometimes even just as a fashion accessory. Additionally, the description of the vehicle does not provide any information on whether it is military-related or simply an ordinary civilian vehicle. Because we have insufficient information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the hypothesis (the man is a soldier) is true or false. We would need more specific context and details to determine whether or not the man is a soldier, such as information about the situation he is in, the type of vehicle, and any other distinctive features that would indicate his possible profession or affiliation.

Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student didn't learn that the infected skin area may become painful? Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","completion":"Neither Dan nor Bob are explicitly mentioned in the provided paragraph as not learning about the infected skin area becoming painful. Both students learned about the human immune system, but the paragraph does not provide specific information about their knowledge of inflammation and its effects. However, we know that Dan studied more about the subject and became very interested, which might imply that he learned this information.

William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province.

The candidates cannot try to communicate with the invigilator himself nor the guard. They cannot spoil the paper and they cannot leave the room for any reason. If they break any of the rules, they will be disqualified. The test consists of answering one question. The invigilator asks the candidates whether they have any questions.

Accelerate smoothly and gently when leaving intersections and stop signs. It is inconsiderate of other drivers and even contributes to congestion at intersections, to dawdle once the light turns green.","completion":"1. Maintain a Consistent Speed: Driving at a consistent speed can significantly improve your gas mileage. This is because rapid acceleration and deceleration both use more fuel. Instead, maintaining a steady speed is considered to be more fuel-efficient. 2. Limit the Use of Air Conditioner: Air conditioners can significantly increase fuel consumption. When possible, use the vehicle's vent system instead. You’ll save more fuel by not using your air conditioner, especially at highway speeds. 3. Remove Extra Weight: Unnecessary weight in your car makes the engine work harder and consume more fuel. By removing heavy items in your vehicle, you can easily improve your fuel efficiency. 4. Regularly Service Your Vehicle: Regular maintenance of your vehicle, like oil changes and replacing air filters, can go a long way towards improving gas mileage. A well-maintained vehicle runs more efficiently, reducing fuel consumption. 5. Use Cruise Control: Cruise control can help you maintain a constant speed and save gas, especially for long trips on the highways. But it's not great for city driving with many stops and starts. 6. Keep Your Tires Properly Inflated: Underinflated tires have more rolling resistance, which means your engine has to work harder to move your vehicle, using more fuel. You should regularly check your tire pressure to ensure it's at the recommended level. 7. Limit Idling: Idling, or keeping your engine running when standing still, can waste a significant amount of fuel. Try to avoid keeping your car running when you're not moving for more extended periods. These strategies are proven ways to improve your fuel efficiency, save money on fuel expenses, and reduce your impact on the environment.

Now, your friend gives you 712 more toys! Yay! Your total number of toys is 279 * b (toys in the 279 bins) plus those 712 new toys. So, the entire toy collection now is equal. We can say 368 * b (the toys in 368 bins) equals 279 * b (toys in the 279 bins) plus 712 new toys. Now let's solve it: 1. From 368 * b, we'll take away 279 * b. We're left with (368 - 279) * b = 712. 2. That means 89 * b = 712. Now, we need to figure out how many toys are in each bin (find the value of \\"b\\"). 3.

Identify the subject: In this case, there is no clear subject or context to judge the sentiment, but referring to a movie as \\"detailed\\" often means it has intricate or elaborate elements, that the person is commenting on. 2. Determine the sentiment: Given the limited information, it is tough to decide if \\"detailed\\" is intended as positive or negative. The word itself is not emotionally charged, but it can be perceived as positive if the reviewer appreciates the intricacy of the movie or slightly negative/blockbuster-centric if the reviewer dislikes movies that are overly elaborate.

The non-conductive region is called the dielectric. In simpler terms, the dielectric is just an electrical insulator. Examples of dielectric media are glass, air, paper, vacuum, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors. A capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field. In SI units, a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device. What type of charges do conductors hold on their facing surfaces?","completion":"Imagine a capacitor is like two pieces of bread with something non-conductive like plastic in between.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the defined process, the production of ice cubes is based on a sequential series of steps: taking a tray, adding water into it, placing the tray into a freezer, allowing the water molecules to slow down through decreased temperature, facilitating the transformation of water into ice, and the final step - the creation of ice cubes. If there's no need for ice cubes, the overall process won't necessarily change unless the purpose behind the stages alters. In this case, the altered purpose doesn't directly impact the individual steps of the process. For instance, the tasks of filling a tray with water and placing it into a freezer would still continue as before. The water would still turn into ice due to reduced temperature. There is no direct interference or modification with the individual steps involved in the transition process from water to ice. However, the lack of need for ice cubes could indirectly impact the final step of the process, mainly the production of ice cubes itself. If ice cubes are not required, you, as a person, might choose to not initiate the process in the first place, or disrupted the process after the freezing has begun by taking the tray out before it's fully solidified into ice cubes, which leads to less ice cubes being made. So the supposed perturbation in this context is driven not by direct alteration of the process, but by an indirect influence based on changed circumstances, i.e., the reduced (or null) demand for ice cubes. The entire process is still the same fundamentally; it’s just that the endpoint (making ice cubes) might no longer be reached due to the changed circumstances. In conclusion, when the need for ice cubes is eliminated, it would indirectly impact a step of the process by altering the outcome of the process (the production of lesser ice cubes or maybe none at all), but the individual steps of the process remain unaltered and still function the way they're supposed to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist.

A:","completion":"In the given article, the magician's assistant, Vivienne, leaves while her husband Zoltini is performing on stage. This happens as a result of an argument they have backstage, which leads to Zoltini slapping her in the face. Unable to tolerate this behavior, Vivienne leaves the performance in the middle of their 'vanishing women' sequence, and takes a taxi with Peter, a crane operator who has been mistaken as her lover by her husband, up to his crane. The situation arose from the happenstance meeting between Peter and the magician couple. Peter, on his way to work, witnesses what appears to be a murder being committed through an open window of a building overlooking the train tracks. Concerned, he and a police officer go to the residence to investigate the situation, only to discover that it was actually Zoltini and Vivienne rehearsing an illusion for their act. Despite this, Zoltini becomes increasingly suspicious that his wife is having an affair with Peter, as he repeatedly sees her with him. In reality, Peter and Vivienne's interactions are innocent, but Zoltini's insecurity and jealousy lead to conflict and ultimately, her departure from the performance. In addition, Pat, Peter's wife, is facing her own issues at work as a hotel switchboard operator. Due to the unfortunate timing of her husband's encounters with Vivienne coupled with their differing work schedules, Pat has been distracted from her duties and is eventually fired from her job. Thus, in the midst of the chaos and misunderstandings arising from the intersecting lives of these four characters, it is Vivienne, the magician's assistant, who leaves the performance while her husband is still on stage. This act symbolizes her decision to stand up for herself and break free from the abusive and controlling relationship she shares with her jealous husband, Zoltini."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When did the city attain military importance Context: A few centuries later, coinciding with the first waves of the invading Germanic peoples (Suevi, Vandals and Alans, and later the Visigoths) and the power vacuum left by the demise of the Roman imperial administration, the church assumed the reins of power in the city and replaced the old Roman temples with religious buildings. With the Byzantine invasion of the southwestern Iberian peninsula in 554 the city acquired strategic importance. After the expulsion of the Byzantines in 625, Visigothic military contingents were posted there and the ancient Roman amphitheatre was fortified. Little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology, excavations suggest that there was little development of the city.

Given the two facts above, sense of smell impacts an animal's what? Choose your answer from: A). mate; B). reproduction; C). growth; D). habitat; E). survival; F). Movement; G). hormones; H). traits; Answer:","completion":"E). survival Given the two facts stated, we can conclude that a better sense of smell impacts an animal's survival. Fact 1 mentions that better senses have a positive impact on an animal's survival, while Fact 2 emphasizes that our sense of smell is infinitely better. Considering these two pieces of information, it can be deduced that an improved sense of smell plays a vital role in an animal's survival. A better sense of smell provides numerous benefits to animals. First and foremost, it allows them to detect food sources more effectively. For example, animals with an enhanced sense of smell can locate food from greater distances or track down prey that may not be easily detectable through other senses. Additionally, an improved sense of smell helps animals avoid predators and other potential threats. By detecting the scent of a predator, an animal can take the necessary precautions to evade danger, such as hiding or fleeing the area. This early warning system can ultimately save an animal's life and improve its chances of survival in the wild. Social interactions are another critical aspect of animal behavior that can be influenced by a heightened sense of smell. Many animals rely on scent to communicate with one another, whether it's to establish social hierarchies, find a mate, or mark territories. A powerful sense of smell can significantly affect an animal's ability to interact with its peers, which, in turn, can have a profound impact on reproduction and overall population health. Lastly, an enhanced sense of smell can also aid animals in navigating their environments more efficiently. Migratory animals often require a strong sense of smell to detect and follow scent trails left by their kind, helping them navigate extensive distances in search of food, shelter, or mating grounds. In a constantly changing environment, the ability to adapt and navigate is crucial to an animal's survival. In conclusion, given the facts presented and the numerous benefits associated with an improved sense of smell, it is clear that sense of smell significantly impacts an animal's survival."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - basement - universe - amazonia - forest - tropical jungle The answer is \\"tropical jungle\\" because","completion":"sloths are primarily found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. The tropical jungle provides an ideal habitat for sloths due to its dense vegetation, high humidity, and constant warm temperatures. In these tropical jungles, sloths can be found living in the mid-to-upper canopy levels of the forest, where they have access to their primary food source—leaves from the cecropia tree, as well as fruits and flowers. The abundant plant life in the tropical jungle offers a constant supply of food, which is essential for the slow-moving and low-energy lifestyle of the sloth. The tropical jungle's complex ecosystem also provides protection for sloths from predators, such as eagles and jaguars. Sloths have intricate camouflage that helps them blend in with their surroundings, making it more difficult for predators to spot them. They also have long, curved claws that allow them to securely hang from branches while they rest or sleep, reducing the risk of falling. Furthermore, the high humidity and warm temperatures of the tropical jungle create a humid and stable microclimate that allows various algae and fungi to grow on the sloths' fur. This algae contributes to the sloths' camouflage, helps regulate their body temperature, and provides nutrients when sloths groom themselves. In summary, the tropical jungle is the perfect habitat for sloths as it offers abundant food, shelter, protection from predators, and a suitable climate that sustains their unique lifestyle and characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Rarity in plants and animals frequently manifests itself in small or reduced population size. Given the two facts above, if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases? A:","completion":"Given the two facts mentioned above, it can be concluded that if a species is rare, harm to its population would result in an increase in the negative impact on the species' overall population size and further contribute to their rarity. To explain this in detail, let's first consider Fact 1: Harming an animal species has a negative impact on the population size of that species. This fact suggests that any damage, injury, or disturbance to a species, whether it is through habitat loss, hunting, or other environmental stressors, would lead to a decrease in the number of individuals within that species. This impact may affect the species' ability to reproduce, find food, or establish suitable living conditions. The reduction in population size can make the species more vulnerable to external pressures and potentially push it closer to extinction. Now let's consider Fact 2: Rarity in plants and animals frequently manifests itself in small or reduced population size. This means that when a species is rare, it typically has fewer individuals within its population compared to a more abundant species. A smaller population size obviously increases the vulnerability of a species, as there is a smaller genetic pool and fewer individuals to protect against potential threats. The rarity of a species can be attributed to several factors, including habitat loss, limited resources, overexploitation, competition, or other factors that reduce its ability to grow and maintain a healthy population. Combining these two facts, it becomes clear that if a species is rare, any harm or damage inflicted upon it can have a greater impact on its population size, making the species even more vulnerable and rare. When a species has a small population, even seemingly minor threats can have a significant impact on their overall numbers. For example, if a rare species loses a small portion of its habitat, it may not be able to adapt and find a new suitable home, resulting in a further decrease in its population. Furthermore, a reduced population size also increases the likelihood of inbreeding and a decrease in genetic diversity. This lack of genetic variation makes it difficult for the species to adapt to changing conditions and increases their susceptibility to diseases and environmental stressors. In turn, this can further decrease the population size and exacerbate the rarity of the species. In conclusion, given the two facts above, harm to a rare species' population would increase the negative impact on its overall population size. The rarity and vulnerability of a species make it more susceptible to threats, and any harm inflicted on it can lead to further reductions in its population, making the species even rarer and driving it closer to the brink of extinction. Conservation efforts should thus focus on protecting and preserving rare species and their habitats to help maintain healthy population sizes and prevent further declines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the given process is: \\"Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth.\\" To provide a more detailed and long answer, let's breakdown the entire process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, known as respiration, into a step-by-step description: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: The process begins with the action of breathing in, or inhaling, air through the nose or mouth. This occurs as the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This contraction increases the amount of space within the chest cavity, lowering the air pressure and allowing air to be drawn in. 2. The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs: Once the air is inhaled, it travels down the trachea (windpipe) and enters the bronchial tubes, which are the branches of the airway that further divide into bronchioles, eventually leading to the lungs' air sacs called alveoli. 3. The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream: When the oxygen-rich air reaches the alveoli, it diffuses across the thin, moist membrane of the alveoli and the surrounding capillaries. Oxygen attaches to red blood cells containing hemoglobin, forming oxyhemoglobin, which is then transported through the bloodstream to supply the body's cells. 4. Circulates through the body: The oxygenated blood is pumped from the lungs by the left side of the heart, through the circulatory system of blood vessels. During this circulation, oxygen is supplied to the different cells, tissues, and organs of the body. 5. The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide: As oxygen is delivered to the cells, they utilize it in a process called cellular respiration to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During this process, cells generate carbon dioxide as a waste product. 6. The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs: The carbon dioxide produced by the cells diffuses into surrounding capillaries. It binds with hemoglobin, forming carbaminohemoglobin, which is then carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream, primarily through veins. 7. The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth: Once the blood carrying carbon dioxide reaches the lungs, the gas diffuses from the capillaries back into the alveoli. The diaphragm and other respiratory muscles then relax, causing the chest cavity to decrease in size. This increase in pressure forces the air, now containing carbon dioxide, out of the lungs and up the trachea, to be finally expelled from the body through the nose or mouth during exhalation. This entire process is crucial for maintaining appropriate oxygen levels in the body, ensuring that cells have the oxygen they need for energy production while efficiently removing carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Blue Thunder Movie plot: Frank Murphy (Roy Scheider) is a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) helicopter-pilot-officer and troubled Vietnam War veteran with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). His newly assigned field partner is Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern). The two patrol Los Angeles at night and give assistance to police forces on the ground. Murphy is selected to pilot the world's most advanced helicopter, nicknamed \\"Blue Thunder\\", a military-style combat helicopter intended for police use in surveillance and against possible large-scale civic disobedience during the forthcoming Olympic games. With powerful armament, stealth technology that allows it to fly virtually undetected, and other accoutrements (such as infrared scanners, powerful microphones and cameras, and a U-Matic VCR), Blue Thunder appears to be a formidable tool in the war on crime. Murphy notes wryly that with enough of these helicopters \\"you could run the whole damn country.\\" But when the death of city councilwoman Diane McNeely turns out to be more than just a random murder, Murphy begins his own covert investigation. He discovers that a subversive action group is intending instead to use Blue Thunder in a military role to quell disorder under the project codename THOR (for \\"Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response\\"), and is secretly eliminating political opponents to advance their agenda. Murphy suspects the involvement of his old wartime nemesis, former United States Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), the primary test pilot for Blue Thunder and someone who felt Murphy was \\"unsuitable\\" for the program. Murphy and Lymangood use Blue Thunder to record a meeting between Cochrane and the other government officials which would implicate them in the conspiracy, but Cochrane looks out the window and sees Blue Thunder and realizes what has happened.

Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in 1968.But handwritten notes purportedly from Sirhan, kept for 42 years by a Century City business executive, suggest that his behavior was calculated and controlled as he waited to shoot the presidential candidate in the hotel's kitchen pantry area.Michael McCowan was an investigator and the youngest member of Sirhan's defense team in 1969 when the accused assassin wrote the narrative of his visit to a target practice range and his later election-night trip to the hotel trip on a legal notepad.\\"He wrote it right in front of me,\\" said McCowan, now 78. Sirhan signed a second statement giving McCowan the rights to the documents, which next week will be sold by a Brentwood auction house.In March, Sirhan appeared before a parole board for his 14th hearing since his conviction in May 1969.The lawyer currently representing Sirhan suggested he was \\"manipulated\\" and \\"set up\\" and did not act alone when Kennedy was shot.William Pepper, who could not be reached Wednesday for comment at his New York office, said Sirhan did not remember the shooting because he was \\"hypno-programmed\\" to kill Kennedy.McCowan disagrees. \\"It never seemed to me to be a conspiracy. He wanted to be a martyr for the Palestinian cause,\\" he said of Sirhan.\\"Sirhan's not stupid. In his 10th-grade history book from his high school in Pasadena he'd underlined the assassination of President McKinley and on the next page of Archduke Ferdinand.\\"Sirhan had then written words to the effect that there would be many more such assassinations, McCowan said. \\"I think he wanted to be a martyr. To me, he was the first terrorist,\\" he said.Before volunteering for Sirhan's defense team, McCowan had been a Los Angeles police officer and earned his law degree. He offered to help defense lawyers \\"because everybody's entitled to a defense, to their day in court,\\" as he put it Wednesday.Along with the handwritten narrative, materials being sold in the online auction include a telegram from the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald , the killer of President John F. Kennedy , to Sirhan's mother, Mary Sirhan. \\"Please accept my sincerest and deepest sympathy,\\" Marguerite Oswald wrote in 1968.Many of those involved with Sirhan's trial are dead. McCowan is the last survivor from the defense team.In the trial's closing arguments, Sirhan lawyer Grant Cooper acknowledged that \\"we are not here to free a guilty man. He is guilty of having killed Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.\\"Sirhan was incapable of premeditation, added another of his lawyers, Russell Parsons, who praised the testimony of psychiatrists and psychologists who labeled Sirhan as a paranoid schizophrenic.Prosecutor Lynn Compton, a chief deputy district attorney, argued that the psychiactric expertise had \\"highly overcomplicated\\" the case.

Kennedy will be auctioned off at Nate D. Sanders’ Tuesday April 12, 2011 auction.This never before seen document is historically significant as it shows that Sirhan’s detailed description of his day at the Ambassador Hotel contradicts the defense team’s argument that the assassination was an impulsive act of a mentally disturbed man who suffered from amnesia or was hypnotized and thus would be unable to recall what happened.Sirhan records the events at the Ambassador Hotel prior to shooting Senator Kennedy in four pages of handwritten notes. In astonishing detail, he recounts the various people that he encounters on a hand-drawn intricate floor plan of the Ambassador’s Hotel’s ballroom. Sirhan places numbers on various rooms on the map, which refer to footnotes on the ensuing three pages, describing what he sees as he heads towards the fateful confrontation that would shock the world.Nate D. Sanders is also auctioning three other Sirhan Sirhan documents.They include Sirhan’s handwritten note in which he proposes strategies to his defense team on how he could fight the murder sentence, including a scenario of blackmailing President Lyndon Johnson, a handwritten alibi claiming that he was at a shooting range the day of the assassination and his trial jottings.The auction ends Tuesday, April 12, 2011 at 5 pm Pacific Daylight Savings Time.Additional information on the Sirhan documents can be found at http://natedsanders.com/ ItemInfo.asp?

Enterovirus infections are major etiological factors in myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Using an experimental murine model of this disease, previous studies have shown that myocarditis susceptibility depends upon activation of T lymphocytes expressing the gamma delta T cell receptor (TcR), and that only mouse strains which accumulate gamma delta T cells in the myocardium show apoptosis of myocytes or evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy-like disease. The objective of the present studies is to demonstrate that gamma delta T cells directly induce greater Fas-dependent apoptosis of cultured myocytes than T cells expressing the alpha beta TcR.', 'Bl.Tg.E alpha mice were infected for 7 days with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Hearts were removed and were either formalin-fixed, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for inflammation, and using TdT-TUNEL for apoptosis, or were minced and collagenase digested for isolation of gamma delta+ and alpha beta+ T cells using immunomagnetic bead separation. Neonatal cultures of cardiac myocytes were isolated from mice less than 2 days old by collagenase and pancreatin digestion, and were either untreated or infected with virus. Levels of Fas (CD95) were measured using FITC-conjugated hamster anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry. Susceptibility of myocytes to Fas-dependent killing was measured by 51Cr-release by labeled myocytes incubated for 4 h on either 3T3-mock or 3T3-FasL transfected cell monolayers. Killing by T cells was also measured in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay. Fas-dependent and perforin-dependent cytotoxicity was determined by specific blocking using either Fas-Fc or concanamycin A.', 'Virally infected myocyte cultures showed significantly enhanced Fas expression compared to uninfected cells, with maximal upregulation of Fas occurring 18-24 h after virus infection. Both infected and uninfected myocytes were selectively killed by FasL-transfected 3T3 cells but not by mock control cells. Approximately 38% of CD3+ lymphocytes isolated from the heart express the gamma delta TcR with the remainder expressing the alpha beta TcR. Both gamma delta+ and alpha beta+ T cells lysed myocyte targets. Blocking studies indicate that gamma delta+ T cells induced predominantly Fas-mediated killing, while alpha beta+ cell produced more perforin-mediated death, although these effectors were capable of Fas-dependent killing as well.

The many found many aquamarine gemstones in the mine, but very few gold nuggets since the Choose from: (1). gemstones were common.. (2). nuggets were common..","completion":"The many found many aquamarine gemstones in the mine, but very few gold nuggets since the gemstones were common. This sentence implies that the individuals who were exploring the mine encountered an abundance of aquamarine gemstones, but gold nuggets were a rare find in this particular location. The reason behind the rarity of gold nuggets is that the aquamarine gemstones were more commonly found in the mine, due to factors that will be discussed further. Aquamarine gemstones and gold nuggets are both valuable materials that can be unearthed in mines, but their occurrence and prevalence can vary significantly. Factors, such as geological processes, the history of a region, and the mineral composition of a location, can contribute to the disparity in the availability of these resources. Aquamarine gemstones are a type of beryl mineral that is colored by iron traces. The mineral is found in granite rocks, as well as in some metamorphic rocks like mica schist and gneiss. Aquamarine gemstones are typically formed in pegmatite deposits or hydrothermal veins. The presence of aquamarine gemstones signifies that the mine in question has experienced geological conditions suitable for the formation of these minerals. Such conditions may have occurred due to tectonic movements, or the cooling and solidification of magma, which created the pegmatite deposits associated with aquamarine. On the other hand, gold nuggets are dense masses of gold that are found in alluvial deposits, as well as in quartz veins, and in deposits associated with hydrothermal activity. The formation of gold deposits requires specific conditions, such as a high temperature, the presence of mineral-rich fluids, and suitable pressure. Consequently, the rarity of gold nuggets in the mine could be due to the absence of these conditions in that particular area. Additionally, the sentence suggests that the presence of aquamarine gemstones was so extensive in the mine that they overshadowed the occurrence of gold nuggets. This could be because the specific geology of the mine was more conducive to the formation of aquamarine gemstones, rather than gold nuggets. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"gemstones were common\\" to provide a clear reason for the abundance of aquamarine gemstones and the scarcity of gold nuggets in the mine. This statement highlights the geological factors that contributed to the predominance of aquamarine gemstones in the mine, making gold nuggets a rarity in comparison."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's subtract the terms with 'r' on the right side: 436*r - 2767*r = -2331*r So, the equation now is: 1774*r = -2331*r + 303770 Next, we will isolate all terms with 'r' on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side of the equation. To do this, we add 2331*r to both sides of the equation to collect all 'r' terms on one side: 1774*r + 2331*r = 303770 This simplifies to: 4105*r = 303770 Finally, to solve for 'r', we will divide both sides of the equation by 4105 since on the left side 'r' is being multiplied by 4105: r = 303770 / 4105 When you perform the division, you get: r =~ 74.02751629499587 So, the solution for 'r' in the equation 1774*r = 436*r - 2767*r + 303770 is approximately 74.03 (rounded to two decimal places)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Only a 4-2 win over Hull on 3 May 2003 stopped the south Wales club from dropping out of the Football League. Three promotions and more than a decade of steady growth later, slipping into the second tier would arguably be no disgrace, given how far the Swans have come. But there is a lot more than just pride at stake as they battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League this season. Why? Because with the improved television deal that kicks-in from the 2016-17 season, can any club afford to go down? And as Deloitte's Football Money League report features 17 Premier League clubs in its top 30, the reported 26th-richest club in the world, Swansea, desperately want to stay in the top flight. The price agreed for domestic television coverage of the Premier League rose by 70% for the 2016-19 cycle, compared to 2013-16. The current deal, announced in 2012, amounts to £3.018bn over three years but the new agreement in February 2015 smashed that figure, totalling £5.136bn. And that excludes the money Premier League teams will receive for overseas television rights, which could be worth an additional £2bn in the current deal. As a result, the money clubs will receive for simply being in the Premier League from next season is set to increase on an astonishing scale. Last season's bottom club, Queens Park Rangers, were paid £68m over the course of last season, but in May 2017 the team finishing bottom can expect to receive around £100m - Chelsea received \\"just\\" £99m for winning the league in 2015. For Swansea, the potential ramifications of missing out on such large sums of money would be huge. For one thing, aspirations to develop and own the Liberty Stadium could go on hold and, inevitably, many of the players would be likely to move on. However, the effect on the local economy could be even more significant, in an area already hit by the news of 750 jobs being lost at the Tata Steel plant in the nearby town of Port Talbot. According to a study by the Welsh Economy Research Unit on Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League in 2011, their first season in the top division created an estimated 420 jobs - 120 of them in the hospitality industry. The hotel consultancy service PFK reported a 9% increase in overnight stays in the area and Swansea council reported that activity on its 'Visit Swansea' website was up 44% on the previous year. Swansea University then saw a significant increase in applications since the local football club joined the elite clubs, a fact vice-chancellor Professor Richard B Davies attributed to Premier League football \\"putting Swansea on the map\\". Emma Frearson Emmanuel, head of the International Office at Swansea University, said: \\"We have seen a 50% increase [in applications] over two years. \\"What we can't say is how many people apply to us directly because of the Swans, but certainly having a Premier League club in the city has been a big help, particularly internationally. \\"The Korean footballer Ki Sung-Yueng [Swansea midfielder] has an incredibly high profile in Korea, so obviously factors like that also raise awareness of the city abroad.\\" That Swansea now generate more revenue than former European Cup winners Ajax and Benfica highlights the financial power of being in the Premier League. The money the television deal of 2012 brought has seen a huge change in the liquidity of top-flight clubs. Paul Rawnsley of Deloitte's Sports Business Group, who has been involved with the analysing football finance for 15 years, added: \\"There has been a sea change in recent years with Premier League clubs becoming collectively profitable for the first time.\\" This is partly due to the fact that Premier League clubs are now only allowed to post limited losses under Uefa's Financial Fair Play requirements. But the guaranteed income of next season means this year's Championship play-off final, already the most lucrative one-off fixture in world football, will now be worth even more to the winners than the £90m earned by 2015 winners Norwich. After a lengthy search to replace Garry Monk in which Jenkins travelled to South America in search of candidates, Swansea have opted to appoint Italian Francesco Guidolin as head coach. The former Udinese boss, who will take charge of the Swans for this first time at Everton on Sunday, is a new face for the Premier League. His task is to keep the club in the top flight, at the expense of experienced Premier League managers such as Sunderland's Sam Allardyce and Newcastle's Steve McClaren. Jenkins has often been praised for getting his managerial appointments right - he will now desperately hope this season's unplanned change of first-team boss does not end up costing the club several tens of millions. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This article discusses the importance of Swansea City Football Club staying in the Premier League, not just for the potential earnings from next year's increased TV rights deal, but also for the local economy, which is already struggling with job losses. Swansea University has reported a significant increase in applications since the club joined the Premier League, highlighting the positive impact of having a top-flight football club on the city. The financial power of being in the Premier League also generates more revenue than other European clubs, which is crucial for the growth and development of the club. The bottom club next season is expected to receive around £100m from the increased TV deal, showing how important it is for Swansea City to avoid relegation this season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, is transmitted to its mammalian host by the tsetse. In the fly, the parasite's surface is covered with invariant procyclin, while in the mammal it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (BF) and is densely covered with highly immunogenic Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). In the BF, the parasite varies this highly immunogenic surface VSG using a repertoire of ~2500 distinct VSG genes. Recent reports in mammalian systems point to a role for histone acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain proteins in the maintenance of stem cell fate, leading us to hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may maintain the BF cell fate in trypanosomes. Using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants for individual bromodomain proteins, we performed RNA-seq experiments that revealed changes in the transcriptome similar to those seen in cells differentiating from the BF to the insect stage. This was recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage proteins on the cell surface. Furthermore, bromodomain inhibition disrupts two major BF-specific immune evasion mechanisms that trypanosomes harness to evade mammalian host antibody responses. First, monoallelic expression of the antigenically varied VSG is disrupted. Second, rapid internalization of antibodies bound to VSG on the surface of the trypanosome is blocked. Thus, our studies reveal a role for trypanosome bromodomain proteins in maintaining bloodstream stage identity and immune evasion. Importantly, bromodomain inhibition leads to a decrease in virulence in a mouse model of infection, establishing these proteins as potential therapeutic drug targets for trypanosomiasis. Our 1.25Å resolution crystal structure of a trypanosome bromodomain in complex with I-BET151 reveals a novel binding mode of the inhibitor, which serves as a promising starting point for rational drug design.

Summarize this article: A Peek at TV’s Future, Via Google Fiber The Google Fiber experiment/maybe-not-an-experiment in Kansas City is important because it shows Google’s ability to compete directly with broadband providers for control of the Internet pipe itself. If Google doesn’t need to rely on the Comcasts/Time Warner Cables of the world to connect with your computer, then all kinds of interesting stuff could happen — if Google really does want to get into the business of becoming a broadband provider. Google says that’s the case, but it’s hard to imagine the company really following through. So, we’ll see. Meantime, Google Fiber, which started rolling out to homes last week, also gives you a glimpse at what The TV Of The Future is supposed to look like. You turn on your set and can watch whatever you want, no matter who is sending out the signal: Broadcast TV, cable TV, Netflix, etc. (You’re probably going to pay for it the same way you do now, though.) BTIG analysts Rich Greenfield and Walt Piecyk trekked out from New York City last week to get a hands-on demo of the TV service (registration required), and you can see a demo clip here. It’s not a thrilling video, because it relies on still shots, but it does give you a sense of what the product actually looks like. The big idea here is one we’ve also seen from other next-gen TV experiments, including Google TV, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo’s new console: One screen, many inputs, and a guide that simply lets you find whatever you want to watch, without having to worry about the source. If a mythical Apple TV ever shows up, it should do the same thing: One other point: Note that the one thing you’d expect to see from Google in a TV product — YouTube — isn’t actually available yet. It’s supposed to show up next year, and the fact that it hasn’t yet is sort of astonishing, given YouTube’s stated ambition to compete directly with TV for eyeballs and ad dollars. But bear in mind that for whatever reason, the Google org structure puts YouTube and Google TV in a completely different silo than Google Fiber. Internally, that must make sense in some Googley way. But it’s hard to fathom from the outside. ||||| After months of fanfare and anticipation, gigabit home Internet service Google Fiber finally went live on Tuesday in Kansas City. The search giant is offering 1Gbps speeds for just 70 per month—significantly faster and cheaper than what any traditional American ISPs are offering. \\"We just got it today and I’ve been stuck in front of my laptop for the last few hours,\\" Mike Demarais, founder of Threedee, told Ars. \\"It’s unbelievable. I’m probably not going to leave the house.\\" He lives in a four-bedroom house run by \\"Homes For Hackers\\" on Kansas City’s Hanover Heights neighborhood, just on the state border with Missouri. The house has become one of the hubs for the KC Startup Village, an informal group of entrepreneurs who have clustered around homes immediately eligible for Google Fiber. Meanwhile, Demarais said that on an Ethernet connection, he’s seen consistent Google Fiber speeds of 600 to 700Mbps, with Wi-Fi topping out around 200Mbps. Even at the slower wireless speeds, that’s more than an order of magnitude faster than what most Americans have at home. \\"The first thing I did was BitTorrent Ubuntu,\\" he said. \\"I think that took two minutes, let me try it again right now.\\" Prior to Tuesday, Demarais—one of the house’s first two residents—said he’d been working out of local McDonald’s and Panera locations for their free Wi-Fi. Mi Wi-Fi es tu Wi-Fi The Homes For Hackers, founded by local Web developer Ben Barreth, had originally been conceived as a matchmaking scheme between entrepreneurs who wanted a free place to live and work, and local families who would open their homes to them. (Ars covered that effort back in August.) But once Google announced its fiber rollout schedule, Barreth realized the families that had signed up were not going to get crazy speeds until Summer 2013. So he took matters into his own hands and, with his wife’s blessing, he liquidated his Roth IRA to put 20 percent down on a house they eventually bought for 48,000 in September 2012. The couple has no plans to profit from the house. Instead, they want to use it as a way to nurture Kansas City’s nascent tech community. He’s letting entrepreneurs like Demarais live in the house rent-free and utilities-free for three months—they just have to pay for their own groceries. \\"We’re strong, devout Christians,\\" Barreth told Ars. \\"I’ve been pushing on doors and a lot of doors have opened for me. I feel like this is what I’m supposed to do right now. It doesn't make a lot of financial sense but I really think it will benefit Kansas City. The whole reason why [we bought the house] was that no one in Kansas City was really exploiting fiber like we could be and this is the way I can bring in individuals that will exploit it. It helps that it’s not a really expensive house. [My wife] is a stay-at-home mom with two kids too, so we’re living off my one salary, and it’s still a strain. It’s a still a big strain.\\" He anticipates getting donations, sponsorships, or, the most-likely scenario, renting out one of the bedrooms via AirBnB to the first Google Fiber \\"tourists\\"—people who might want to come for a day or two at a time to try it out. \\"50 a night for 10 nights a month would cover mortgage and most of the utilities,\\" he said. Barreth has been so busy dealing with local media requests that he hasn’t yet had a chance to use the connection himself—he and his family live about 20 minutes away from the second house, and their neighborhood was not included in the first rollout regions. Kansas City, setting itself apart Demarais said he knew he’s been spoiled: \\"Wherever I go after this, my Internet speed is going to be ruined.\\" His company, Threedee, hopes to provide an added benefit to the growing 3D printing ecosystem. \\"We’re building a front-end dev toolkit that lets developers view and manipulate 3D models in a browser,\\" he said. \\"We have an API that lets you communicate those models directly to 3D printers entirely in javascript without need to convert to a 3D model. We want to shake up manufacturing with tools that will allow people to buy products made for them.\\" Demarais moved to Kansas City from Boston to work on his new startup—and while the move was driven in part by Google Fiber, being able to live rent-free for 90 days was huge. He had considered staying home in Boston or moving to San Francisco, but both cities are notoriously expensive. \\"I don’t want to raise capital yet and it’s hard to do that if I would need to get a part-time job just to pay rent,\\" he added. \\"All of that stuff is taken care for me, that was the big thing. People are too quick to discredit the value of a free-rent environment with like-minded people. KC needs to separate itself from the other scenes. Why here? Fiber is not enough. I think you need to have a dense startup community, and if young people are not moving here and trying to start startups, you need to artificially create that flow.\\" ||||| Google Fiber will soon be a viable cable alternative in many neighborhoods in Kansas City. Hopefully it will also soon become an alternative in every city. For 120 a month, Google Fiber brings you normal cable TV, a massive digital video recorder, and broadband Internet access that is 100-times as fast as your cable company's. For 70 a month, you can get just the Internet access. If that's not enough, there's one promise Google is making that will make cable customers everywhere jump for joy. Google is promising that its installer will arrive when he or she says he will arrive — not force you to stay home for hours for an appointment \\"window.\\" It's a big country, so it will unfortunately likely take a while for Google to come to your neighborhood. But if nothing else, here's hoping Google Fiber scares the bejeezus out of the cable industry, forcing cable companies to upgrade their own broadband services and finally put a bigger premium on customer service.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

Title: Oliver Twist Movie plot: A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist (John Howard Davies) by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble (Francis L. Sullivan) and matron Mrs. Corney (Mary Clare). At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry (Gibb McLaughlin), from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger (Anthony Newley), a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin (Alec Guinness), an old man who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow (Henry Stephenson), a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. Fortunately, a witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin (Amy Veness). Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks (Ralph Truman), who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait. By chance, Fagin's associate, the vicious Bill Sykes (Robert Newton), and Sykes' kind-hearted prostitute girlfriend (and former Fagin pupil) Nancy (Kay Walsh) run into Oliver on the street and forcibly take him back to Fagin.

When we do that, we get: 53 - 1 = -13*h Now, we have: 52 = -13*h Next, we need to get rid of the \\"-13\\" that is with the \\"h\\". We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -13. Like this: 52 / -13 = (-13*h) / -13 When we do that, we find: -4 = h So, the answer to the problem is: h = -4 And that's it!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The bill was drafted last year after the punk band Pussy Riot performed a protest song against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow's main cathedral. Two Pussy Riot members are now serving prison terms in remote penal colonies. The bill says blasphemy could incur up to three years in jail or a fine of up to 300,000 roubles (9,700;Â£6,300). Russian commentators say the bill appears to have strong backing from Mr Putin. It was passed by the Duma - Russia's lower house - in a first reading on Tuesday. To become law it has to pass two more readings in the Duma, then a vote in the upper house - the Federation Council - and get a final sign-off by Mr Putin. The entire parliament is dominated by Mr Putin's supporters. The text refers to offences against religions that are \\"an integral part of Russia's historical inheritance\\" - implying that it covers Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. Last August two Pussy Riot performers - Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova - were sentenced to two years each in jail for \\"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\\" over their obscenity-laced \\"punk prayer\\" against Mr Putin. The sentences provoked widespread international condemnation. Human rights activists and some critics of the new anti-blasphemy bill in the Duma say its wording is too vague and could lead to unjustified prosecutions. Yuri Sinelshchikov, a Communist MP and former prosecutor, warned that it could provoke \\"an outburst of combative atheism, in its most aggressive form, and enmity between believers and non-believers\\". Some human rights activists warned that \\"insults to believers\\" might include the teaching of Darwin's theory of evolution or the Big Bang theory about the universe. A co-author of the bill, Yaroslav Nilov of the nationalist Liberal Democrats (LDPR), insisted that the text would be amended before the next Duma votes.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Our education system was invented. There were no public systems of education before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school--things you liked--because you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music. You're not going to be a musician. Don't do art. You're not going to be an artist. In addition, the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at wasn't valued at school. I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. But now you need a Master's degree where the previous job required a Bachelor, and now you need a Ph.D. for the other. It's a process of academic inflation , and it indicates the whole structure of education needs changing. All the great teachers I've ever met and worked with are people who can inspire interest and curiosity and light up people's imaginations with the interests they themselves have for a particular field of work. I mean, teaching is not only a process of giving people direct instructions and information they have to memorize, it is much more than that. I believe our only hope for the future is to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children. And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face the future. By the way, we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.

What is the answer for the question: Who needs to show that he can be a worthy father? from the following article ? A newspaper story in the Barnyard News predicts a cold winter. To avoid freezing in his shack, Foghorn decides to woo Miss Prissy (\\"I need your love to keep me warm\\"), who lives in a warm, cozy cottage across the way. Miss Prissy is flattered by Foghorn's two-second courtship but tells him that, to prove his worthiness as her mate, he needs to show that he can be a worthy father to her bookish-looking son. The little boy – Egghead Jr., a chick similar in appearance to Tweety, dressed in a stocking cap and oversized glasses – would rather read about \\"Splitting the Fourth Dimension\\" than engage in typical little boy games. Foghorn immediately catches on to this and sets out to win his audition by showing Egghead Jr. how to play various sports games. Although he apparently has never participated in any of the below-listed events before, Egghead Jr. effortly masters them all, as depicted in the cartoon's gags: Baseball.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

Typhoon Sanba was aiming squarely at South Korea early Sunday after passing over the Japanese island of Okinawa, according to regional forecasters. It made landfall in northeastern Okinawa around 6:30 a.m. Sunday (5:30 p.m. ET Saturday) with an eye that was nearly half the island's length. There were no immediate reports of damage. As of 9:50 p.m. ET, Samba was moving to the north at 30 kph (18 mph), the Japan Meteorological Association said. The storm has maximum sustained winds of estimated winds of 194 kph (120 mph) and gusts nearing 241 kph (149 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the U.S. military agency responsible for issuing tropical storm warnings in the Pacific Ocean. Sanba is on track to make a direct hit on South Korea in a couple of days, the Korean Meteorological Association predicted, before moving up the Chinese coast. People in Okinawa and along the rest of the Ryukyu Island chain took serious precautions ahead of the storm. The infrastructure on the island is designed to withstand powerful storms, since the island is in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent. But storm surge could prove to be a problem for residents. \\"It's a large storm, and it's going to have a fairly wide-reaching effect,\\" CNN International weather anchor Jenny Harrison said. In the city of Ginowan in southern Okinawa on Saturday afternoon, skies were gray with dark clouds in the distance, according to video from CNN iReporter Kathryn Spoor. Even though it had weakened since Friday when it was briefly classified as a super typhoon, Sanba now has the same intensity as a Category 3 hurricane, meteorologists say. A Category 3, on a scale of 1 to 5, is a major hurricane with winds ranging from 111 to 129 mph. The storm is expected to have a far-reaching effect. It could cause serious flooding in the Philippine capital of Manila, for instance. Sanba is forecast to make a second landfall in mainland South Korea around noon local time Monday. It could also strike southern mainland Japan. Last month, Typhoon Bolaven killed more than 60 people on the Korean peninsula. Bolaven had also swept over Okinawa, which escaped relatively unscathed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? In order to get along with people in conversation, you should avoid bragging about how great you are at work, tennis, or writing novels. If you’re really good at something, then people will be able to see that for themselves over time or they’ll hear about it from someone else. If you dominate the conversation by talking all about how awesome you are, then it’ll be hard to get along with people because they may think of you as self-absorbed and may get bored or even annoyed. You can talk about your interests without talking about how great you are at them. There’s no need to mention any awards you won and it’ll make people cringe a little. Instead, praise the virtues of other people. That’s much more interesting to them. One key part of being a good conversationalist is taking the time to consider your words before they come out of your mouth. If you’re the kind of person who thinks before he speaks, or who even thinks by speaking, then it’s time to slow down and consider how your words will impact the people around you so you avoid offending people. It’s also a good trick because you may realize that you may be saying something just a little bit awkward or even boring to the people around you. Spend a few seconds forming a question in your head if you know it’s going to be of a sensitive nature. This is far better than blurting out something you may regret. A good conversationalist never takes over a conversation; instead, he knows how to get people talking and how to make them feel comfortable. If you want to get along with people, then you can’t go on and on about yourself; instead, you should talk enough to be interesting and winning, but make sure not to do more than roughly half the talking when you’re having a one-on-one convo so the other person doesn’t feel bored or uncared for. If you’re in a group conversation, then you can tell a funny anecdote or two, but make sure other people contribute to the conversation. Let other people talk when they have something to say and don’t interrupt them just to prove them wrong. Even if someone is saying something a bit untrue, you should avoid the temptation to argue with every little thing he or she is saying. This won’t win you any friends and definitely won’t help you get along with people. Another way to get along with people more easily is to avoid topics that may cause people to get easily upset. These include abortion, gay rights, general political views, and controversial views on marriage or raising children. Once you get to know people better, you’ll be able to discuss more serious topics with them, but when you’re first trying to get along with people in conversation, you should stick to more agreeable topics, such as your weekend plans, your hobbies, or your favorite bands. If someone else brings up a sensitive topic, then it can help you get along with people if you can tactfully steer him or her away from that subject to something more user-friendly. Tact is key when it comes to getting along with people in a conversation. Having tact means choosing your words and your timing carefully. If you want to give someone personal advice, for example, you should do it when you’re alone so the person doesn’t feel embarrassed; the same goes for telling a person he has something stuck in his teeth. You should avoid making careless comments, like saying “Marriage is the most important part of life” to someone who has just been divorced, and you should always be sensitive to the feelings of others before you speak. Another way to be tactful is to avoid revealing too much personal information to people you don’t know all that well. While you may feel like this will help you get along with people, it can actually push them away. Tactful people also acknowledge cultural differences when they talk to people. This can help you see whether or not your comments will be received well. Another great way to get along with people conversationally is to find common bonds to bring you closer together. As you talk to people, keep your ears open for hints that you might have similar interests; if it turns out you come from the same state, for example, then it may be a sign that you follow the same sports teams. Though you don’t have to have everything in common with the person you’re talking to, just finding one or two things to bond over, whether it’s your love of The Bachelor or your obsession with cooking pastries. Even if you and a person disagree about almost everything in the world, if you’re both 49ers fans, you can build an entire relationship out of that. Never underestimate how important it is to have something to bond over.

Open-Source A.W.S.: Creating a Thousand Clouds Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing service of Amazon.com, has sparked a boom in powerful and flexible computing over the Internet. Now the same technology is entering the corporate mainstream, through open-source cloud computing. In the past few years, companies and organizations like Open Nebula; the Open Stack alliance; Cloud.com, which is part of Citrix; and Eucalyptus have been offering various forms of the kind of software that works inside A.W.S. The idea of these free versions is to create smaller versions of the cloud, so people can do more with the computers in their own homes, institutions and businesses. If the company is big enough to have lots of partners, employees, and strong engineering talent, its open source cloud could amount to a supercomputer with lots of different capabilities, on the cheap. Like many open source projects, which depend on a core of engineers creating and then publicly releasing lots of complex software for free, there are a range of opinions about how to interact with the profit-making giants. Of all the versions, perhaps the most successful, as well as the friendliest to Amazon, is Eucalyptus, which easily shares data and computing chores with A.W.S. The idea is to give A.W.S. an ally in the open source world, giving customers of either Eucalyptus or A.W.S. the ability to move jobs on or off the clouds they own, depending on workload needs and internal security policies. “Like Amazon or not, they are the de facto standard for cloud,” says Marten Mickos, the chief executive of Eucalyptus. “It’s just that not everyone wants it. Some people in open source think it is immoral to make a profit. I don’t.” Mr. Mickos was previously the head of MySQL, an open source database company that was purchased by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) in 2008 for 1 billion. Eucalyptus originated with a project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but is clearly intended to be a profit-making business. Its customers include Puma, Sony, and the federal Department of Agriculture, and it counts over 25,000 clouds running on its software worldwide. Eucalyptus runs for free when customers use open source virtualization software, necessary for cloud computing, like Xen and KVM. When customers use the more popular products from VMWare, they must use Eucalyptus’s subscription product, which costs 2,000 per server a year. So far, fewer than 100 paying customers have shown up, but last year Mr. Mickos deployed teams in Europe, India and China. “There is more technology involved here than in MySQL, but the shift to cloud computing will be faster than the shift to open source was 10 years ago,” he says, adding that 21 of the 100 largest companies in the United States are experimenting with Eucalyptus. Mr. Mickos was a very visible hero of open source in the days before Sun bought MySQL. He left Sun before it was acquired by Oracle, which still offers the open source database as well as its proprietary products, but still keeps an eye on MySQL. “The product is technically better, and the sales are going well,” he says of Oracle MySQL. “But they don’t care about the community, their team for that is small, and they don’t invite outside people to comment on changes they make.

La falta de responsabilidad por parte de algunos padres en contribuir económicamente con el sustento de sus hijos ha generado una carga considerable en el sistema social y en las instituciones gubernamentales destinadas a brindar apoyo a estas familias. Las consecuencias alcanzan desde la calidad de vida y la educación de los hijos afectados hasta el estado emocional de ambas partes involucradas, ya que el rechazo a asumir la responsabilidad financiera podría interpretarse como un rechazo emocional por parte del padre. Las autoridades y diferentes instituciones han implementado varias medidas para enfrentar la evasión del pago de la manutención. Entre ellas se encuentran la promulgación de leyes y reglamentos que requieren a los padres asumir su responsabilidad financiera, el establecimiento de sistemas de registro automatizados para monitorear el cumplimiento de los pagos, la colaboración entre agencias gubernamentales y entidades privadas para localizar a los padres que no cumplen con sus obligaciones, y la creación de programas educativos y de concientización sobre las repercusiones de no proveer el soporte financiero adecuado. A pesar de estos esfuerzos, la evasión del pago de la manutención por parte de algunos padres continúa siendo un problema en muchas áreas.

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years' medical education and clinical experience. Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications. Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession. In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen \\"exciting developments\\" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based. \\"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science,\\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology. \\"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP). More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love. They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology. Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation. RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its prescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field. The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges. The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an RxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its RxP policy. \\"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members,\\" says APA president Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University. With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late. This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges. Over the past decade, 14 state legislatures have considered such laws. Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write prescriptions.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

Thereafter, a distinctly Canadian army and navy was established, followed by an air force, that, because of the constitutional arrangements at the time, remained effectively under the control of the British government until Canada gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931, in part due to the distinguished achievement and sacrifice of the Canadian Corps in the First World War.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In the US, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga. Some parents like the idea of avoiding competitive sports in P. E. class. Yet others surely dislike that idea. _ .

Plot title: Karla Movie plot: This movie--based on a true story that shocked Canadians and dominated headlines--opens in Oct 2000 with Karla Homolka approaching the 8 year mark of a 12 year manslaughter sentence and up for parole. Under Canadian law, parole would usually be virtually automatic, but Karla's case is no ordinary case. Karla has been sent to Saskatoon to meet with a prison appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Arnold, to evaluate her suitability for parole. Most of the movie is told from the vantage point of Karla and Dr. Arnold examining the past actions that landed her in prison with a view to making a decision on parole.Karla begins by discussing how she and her ex-husband Paul Bernardo first met. At age 18, Karla is working in a veterinary clinic and is sent to Toronto by her employer to attend a veterinary convention. However, she is also interested in meeting men. Karla and a female colleague are in a hotel restaurant when they are approached by Paul and a male friend. There is an almost immediate strong attraction between Paul and Karla, and they soon find themselves making love in Karla's hotel room. Karla's colleague and Paul's friend are also in the room and feel quite uncomfortable.Karla and Paul begin a relationship which, at first, seems quite happy and successful. Karla gives Paul a pair of handcuffs for use in sex play. However, while having sex, Paul introduces the possibility that he might be a rapist. In looking back at this incident with Dr. Arnold, Karla claims she thought this was just innocent sex talk on Paul's part.Paul's true meaning, however, is quickly shown to the viewer to be something far more sinister: Paul is, in fact, the notorious Scarborough rapist, who has been terrorizing women with frequent and brutal assaults. However, the police and the general public do not yet know the true identity of the Scarborough rapist, and Karla also claims not to have known at this time. A police sketch of the Scarborough rapist is published in a Toronto newspaper. This looks enough like Paul that people who know him... My question: Whos parole was denied?

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it.

Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

Here is an article: TOKYO — Japan reacted with sorrow and outrage on Sunday to the posting by the Islamic State of a video purporting to show the grisly killing of the journalist Kenji Goto, bringing an end to a hostage standoff that has horrified this usually tranquil nation. Gripped by anger and disbelief, Japan has so far shown support for the strong line taken by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who did not meet the hostage takers’ initial demands on Jan. 20 for a 200 million ransom, pledging not to yield to terrorism. Mr. Abe strongly condemned the murder claim made in the video released early Sunday, saying Japan “will cooperate with the international community and make the terrorists pay the price.” “I’m outraged by the despicable terrorist act, and I will never forgive the terrorists,” Mr. Abe told reporters on Sunday at the prime minister’s office in Tokyo. For now, the Japanese public seems to be united in grief and a desire to show support for Mr. Abe and other leaders. However, political analysts have said that as the shock wears off, there will be more questioning of how Mr. Abe’s government handled the crisis, which began with the appearance online of a video from the militant group threatening the lives of two Japanese hostages, Mr. Goto and Haruna Yukawa. In that first video, the group called the country’s pledge of 200 million to help shore up the government of Iraq and to assist refugees in Turkey, Syria and Lebanon a “foolish decision” and called for a ransom of the same amount. The group dropped the ransom demand after releasing a video online days later showing the decapitated body of Mr. Yukawa, a 42-year-old adventurer. The militants changed tack, offering to swap Mr. Goto for Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman on death row in Jordan for a deadly bombing there 10 years ago. This seemed to offer hope that a way would be found to secure Mr. Goto’s release. Those hopes came crashing down over the weekend, when another video appeared showing Mr. Goto kneeling in an orange jumpsuit in what appeared to be a dry riverbed. Next to him stood a masked militant who spoke while waving a knife, which he then apparently used to cut off Mr. Goto’s head. While the video had yet to be confirmed as authentic on Sunday, the top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said the government had no reason to believe it was not real. He said Japan had had no contact with the militants, suggesting that the nation was relying almost entirely on Jordan to handle the fate of the hostages. During the 10-day hostage standoff, Japan said it was trying to establish communication with the militants via local tribal and religious leaders, but apparently to no avail. The gruesome images helped feed an outpouring of sympathy for Mr. Goto, 47, a veteran journalist who entered Islamic State-held territory in Syria in late October in a doomed effort to rescue Mr. Yukawa, who had been captured in August, according to Mr. Goto’s mother. Local television stations showed clips from Mr. Goto’s reports out of Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones, where he often reported on the plight of children and other noncombatants. “My son’s final act was to go to Syria to help a fellow Japanese,” Mr. Goto’s mother, Junko Ishido, said Sunday. “Please understand his kindness and courage.” President Obama issued a statement in which he said the United States “condemns the heinous murder” of Mr. Goto, whom he described as a courageous journalist. Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the United States National Security Council, said the American authorities were working to confirm the authenticity of the video, and called for the release of all remaining hostages. In a brief statement Sunday on the official Jordanian news agency, Petra, a government spokesman, Mohammad Momani, said that Jordan spared no effort to try to save the Japanese hostage’s life and was in continuous contact with the government of Japan during the negotiations. Petra quoted Mr. Momani as saying, “The group has rejected all attempts made by the concerned authorities to secure the release of the Japanese hostage.” The video of Mr. Goto’s killing came two days after a new deadline set by the group expired, and the Jordanian government did not give in to its demand that Ms. Rishawi be freed. Left unclear by the video, which was posted on a Twitter account associated with the Islamic State’s media organization, Al Furqan, was the fate of a Jordanian pilot, whom the extremists also threatened to kill if Jordan did not release Ms. Rishawi. Jordan had agreed to release Ms. Rishawi only if the extremists provided proof that the pilot, First Lt. Moaz al- Kasasbeh, was still alive. He was shot down over Syria on Dec. 24 during airstrikes on the Islamic State. While there was widespread support in Jordan for a swap, officials insisted that they wanted their pilot released as well, or at least wanted to see evidence that he was still alive before they would release Ms. Rishawi, who was convicted for her role in a series of bombings of hotels in Amman that killed at least 57 people in 2005. Mr. Momani’s statement also said that officials were continuing their efforts to free the pilot. In the latest 67-second video from the militants, a black-masked extremist, who appeared to be the man known as Jihadi John because of his British-accented English, blamed Mr. Abe for Mr. Goto’s fate. “To the Japanese government,” the man said, “you, like your foolish allies in the satanic coalition, have yet to understand that we by Allah’s grace are the Islamic caliphate, with authority and power. An entire army thirsty for your blood.” There has already been some criticism in Japan that Mr. Abe provoked the crisis by offering nonmilitary aid to countries battling the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, but Mr. Abe vowed not to back away from his pledges. “We will increase our humanitarian aid, including food and medical support,” he said Sunday. “Japan will resolutely fulfill its responsibility to the international community in the fight against terrorism.” Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo and Rod Nordland from Amman, Jordan.

Article: Today, almost everyone has heard of Harry Potter.The books detailing his experiences at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have aroused passion, creativity, and interest in reading throughout the world. But have you ever considered why you are a fan of the Harry Potter series? JK Rowling has created a list of characters and an environment for them to inhabit that appeals to both adults and children. The fantasy aspect of the wizarding world expands the imagination, and takes the mind to new and exciting places.Anything could happen there.Her stories contain parts of the believable and unbelievable, changing the predictability that readers commonly come across and bear in fiction. The main theme of the series, including good versus evil, prejudice, love, death, sacrifice, friendship and loyalty, in actuality contributes to the ever-lasting nature of the stories.At the same time, these themes remind us of classic literature, offering mature readers tales that wear like a comfortable pair of shoes, while introducing younger readers to concepts they will meet throughout their lives. Much of the appeal also comes from the characters.In each book, JK Rowling introduces and describes the characters in such a way that we wonder not only about their futures, but also about their pasts.Even supporting characters are suddenly more than just extras in the background.And what of Harry Potter himself? We care about Harry, because we watch him grow from an innocent boy to a powerful wizard.We see him as both Hero and Victim.He experiences endless love and extreme pain, and as readers, we experience them with him. This perfect combination of emotion, suspense and fantasy, together with the fact that JK Rowling is a superb storyteller is the reason why we are Harry potter fans.People are fond of Harry Potter series.With books like these, it' s hard not to be.

November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany. In 2014, the heirs of the artist, in... answer the following question: What two movements did the man who taught a variety of positions help influence toward the end of his life? The answer is:","completion":"El Lissitzky, a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist, and architect, significantly influenced two key movements towards the end of his life: the Bauhaus and the Constructivist movements. The Bauhaus movement, which emerged in Germany in the early 20th century, sought to unite art, craft, and technology. It focused on the idea that design and architecture should serve the needs of society and promote efficiency and functionality. El Lissitzky's work, particularly his graphic design and typography, greatly influenced this movement. His emphasis on goal-oriented creation and the belief that the artist could be an agent for change resonated with the Bauhaus' core principles. The Constructivist movement, which originated in Russia, was an artistic and architectural movement emphasizing abstraction, geometry, and the use of industrial materials. It aimed to reflect the modern industrial society and the ideals of the Soviet Union. El Lissitzky's work in the development of Suprematism with Kazimir Malevich and his extensive experience designing exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union played a significant role in shaping the Constructivist movement. His experiments with production techniques and stylistic devices became integral to the movement's visual language. Throughout his career, El Lissitzky consistently exchanged ideas and spread his beliefs across various positions, schools, and artistic media. As a result, he profoundly impacted the development and direction of the Bauhaus and Constructivist movements towards the end of his life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida man who admitted to the near-fatal beating of his two-year-old son while teaching him how to box remained behind bars Thursday, facing felony charges. Lee Willie Dejesus, 23, of Homestead, appeared in court Wednesday night wearing a green protective vest reserved for those on suicide watch, reported CNN affiliate WFOR. A judge denied him bail. Dejesus' son was on life support Thursday, said Ed Griffith, spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office. Griffith said it was his understanding that the child was being kept on life support so his organs could be donated. Dejesus is charged with aggravated child abuse with great harm, a first-degree felony, and aggravated child neglect with great harm, a second-degree felony. Griffith said once prosecutors are notified the child has been taken off life support and pronounced dead, they are poised to file first-degree murder charges against Dejesus. Miami-Dade police said Dejesus was watching the child while his mother was at work Monday night. He told police that he put on boxing gloves and struck the child about 15 times on his face, head, torso and shoulders over a period of 15 minutes, punching him so hard at one point that the boy fell off the bed and struck his head on the tile floor. The child was rushed to Children's Hospital where he underwent surgery for bleeding on the brain.

Paragraph: The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed.

Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel. YOU CAN STILL EAT DIET FOOD Low fat ice-cream, Diet Coke and protein powder are still in my diet but I eat them because I prefer the taste over their ‘real’ counterparts. I can still ask for dressing on the side and no butter on my sandwich not because I’m counting calories but because I can’t see the point in eating food I don’t actually want.

The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said HS3, between Leeds and Manchester, would cut journey times and help drive economic growth. The HS2 link between London and Birmingham has been dogged by protests over its planned route. The government said it had committed £13bn in northern transport funding. The IPPR said the north suffered from under-developed road and rail links and a \\"North First\\" policy was needed. The proposed HS3 line, approved in March's budget, has a projected travel time of just 30 minutes between Leeds and Manchester, with potential extensions to Liverpool and Hull. Tom Kibasi, from the IPPR, said: \\"The time it takes to travel, on hugely dated infrastructure, between our great regional cities is a national disgrace - this is just not what happens in Germany, Japan or France. \\"Given the Brexit result, the north of England must urgently see growing prosperity. \\"A proper east-west crossing would boost northern and UK growth, and must now take priority above all other major transport projects, including Crossrail 2 and HS2.\\" The IPPR said prioritising HS3 would also address the imbalance in spending between London and the north of England. It said the government planned, over the next five years, to spend £304 per inhabitant in the North East, £289 per inhabitant in the North West and £247 per head in Yorkshire and the Humber. In London the figure rises to £1,869 per head. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government had already committed £60m to preparatory work on the HS3 line and was considering options for a trans-Pennine road tunnel between Manchester and Sheffield.

Answer:","completion":"Oracle bones, also known as \\"turtle shells\\" or \\"dragon bones,\\" were used extensively in ancient China, particularly during the Shang (c. 1600-1046 BCE) and Western Zhou (1046-771 BCE) dynasties, for divination purposes. The use of oracle bones served as an essential medium in predicting future events, resolving uncertainties, and seeking guidance from ancestors and deities in various aspects of life including agriculture, weather, warfare, and health issues. This practice, known as pyromancy, played a central role in the ruling class's decision-making process and was a significant component of ancient Chinese culture and religion. Oracle bones were mostly made from turtle plastrons (the underside shells) and ox scapulae (shoulder bones), but occasionally other animal bones were used as well. The divination process, practiced by specialized diviners, followed certain steps: 1. Preparation: The oracle bones were cleaned, polished, and had a smooth surface prepared for inscribing the questions. They were often drilled with small holes to control the direction and pattern of cracks that would form during the divination process. 2. Inscription: The questions were inscribed onto the bones with a sharp bronze or stone tool. These inscriptions, written in an early form of Chinese script known as \\"oracle bone script,\\" would typically address deities, ancestors, or natural elements, seeking guidance or explanations for particular situations. 3. Divination: The diviner placed the oracle bone over a fire or applied heat with a heated metal rod onto the prepared holes. The heat would cause the bone to crack, producing distinct patterns and lines. 4. Interpretation: The diviner would then interpret the patterns and cracks to provide an answer to the question. The answer was often inscribed alongside the original question on the oracle bone, creating a permanent record of the divination process and result. 5. Preservation: The oracle bones that had been used for divination were carefully stored, often in pits, as they were considered sacred items that held considerable spiritual power. Over time, large collections of oracle bones were accumulated and preserved. The discovery of these inscribed oracle bones has greatly enriched our understanding of ancient Chinese history, culture, and language. They offer a valuable glimpse into the belief systems, political structure, social customs, and even the daily lives of people living during that period. Additionally, the oracle bones script is the earliest identifiable form of written Chinese, which provides vital information for the study of the development of the Chinese writing system and language. In summary, the Chinese used oracle bones as a divination tool to seek guidance from ancestors and deities in various aspects of life. This practice was deeply rooted in ancient Chinese culture and played a crucial role in decision-making processes among the ruling class. The inscriptions found on these oracle bones have since become invaluable resources for studying ancient Chinese history, language, and beliefs."},{"prompt":"Context: Tracy bought some new item at the store and used it in her cake.

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others.

But don't get too hung up on the names; the bottom line: You need to check the camera port, and computer port, and then find or buy a cord which has those specific ends or pin sets. If you have a USB cable instead, you can also use that cable to transfer movies/videos to your computer. The same is true whether you are transferring the movies to a PC or a MAC and for various types of camcorders. You could store your videos in a memory card that you insert into your camera or camcorder. Memory cards are small square disks that store your videos. To transfer these videos to your computer, simply insert the memory card in the slot on your computer. Some older computers don't have slots for SD memory cards, but you can buy an external card reader that attaches into the USB port of your computer. Go to your computer's settings, usually My Computer, and look for devices and drives. You should see the SD memory card pop up once you insert it. Click on the icon for the card, and you should see your videos (and photos) pop up on the computer. It's that simple. Move them to any file folder you want. You should figure out whether your computer has the ports needed to transfer movies from a camera. Check and see whether the device has a port for a FireWire and/or USB cable as well as a SD memory slot. The SD memory card slot is a thinner slot the width of a small memory card. It's usually located on the front or side of your computer. To determine whether you have a FireWire port, click on Control Panel, and then Network Connections (or Network & Internet Connections). Look for an icon labeled 1394 Connection. A FireWire port is a narrower slit, whereas a USB port is thicker and resembles a square with a smaller square on top. To determine whether there is a USB port, click on the start menu of your computer, select \\"Control Panel.\\" Then choose \\"Performance and Maintenance\\" and \\"See basic information about your computer.\\" You will be in a System Properties Window. Locate the \\"Hardware\\" tab at the screen's top, and click on it, and then \\"Device Manager.\\" Locate \\"Universal Serial Bus controllers\\" on the list and click on the plus sign to open it. If you have a USB port, you should see the word \\"enhanced\\" as one of the titles. Be aware that Mac recently phased the FireWire ports out of its computers in favor of something called the Thunderbolt. You can buy Thunderbolt to FireWire adapters pretty cheaply, though. The Macs use USB 3.0 connectors. The Thunderbolt technology allows for faster transfer speeds. You can often find the Thunderbolt ports on the back of the computer. For example, on the back of the Mac pro, you will find six Thunderbolt ports, along with two USB 3.0 ports.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Given the question: This article: Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival.

Given the question: Answer the question based on the following text. Question: John is relaxing at the beach watching the waves when the wind begins to pick up. When the wind begins to blow faster, what happens to the size of the waves increase or decrease? Text: The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. The answer is:","completion":"When John is relaxing at the beach and the wind begins to pick up and blow faster, the size of the waves will increase. This is based on the given text, which explains that the size of an ocean wave depends on three factors: the speed of the wind, the distance over which the wind blows, and the duration of the wind blowing. As the wind speed increases, one of these contributing factors also increases, which ultimately results in bigger waves. In more detail, the relationship between the wind and the ocean waves is an intricate process. As the wind interacts with the water surface, it transfers some of its energy to the water, causing ripples and waves to form. These waves then grow in size as they continuously receive energy from the wind. The higher the wind speed, the more energy is transferred and the larger and taller the waves become. When the wind blows over a long distance, known as the \\"fetch,\\" the waves have more space and time to accumulate energy and increase in size. Similarly, a persistently blowing wind over a longer period also contributes to the growth of waves by continuously providing energy for their development. Thus, when the wind at the beach where John is relaxing begins to blow faster, the size of the ocean waves will increase due to the enhanced wind speed contributing to the overall energy transfer to the water, and ultimately resulting in larger, more impressive waves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research.

Process: - Water gets into cracks in rocks - The water freezes into ice - The cracks expand - Over time the rocks split - The rocks are now in smaller pieces. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rocks will remain in large pieces happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If the rocks were to remain in large pieces, as the perturbation hypothesis suggests, the rate of weathering would be significantly affected. This is because the rate at which weathering occurs depends on the surface area exposed to weathering agents, such as water, air, and temperature fluctuations. Larger rocks have a smaller surface area relative to their volume, meaning that the rate of weathering will be slower as there is less surface area exposed to weathering agents. One of the primary reasons for rocks breaking into smaller pieces, such as through the process of freeze-thaw weathering, is to increase the surface area that is available for chemical and physical weathering processes. By maintaining the rocks in large pieces, the perturbation hypothesis effectively keeps the rate of weathering relatively slower. This, in turn, impacts the rate of processes like soil formation and nutrient cycling within ecosystems, as weathering is a key driver of these natural processes. The supposed perturbation would have both direct and indirect effects on the weathering process. Directly, the perturbation would prevent the cracks from expanding and the rocks from splitting, thus maintaining their large size and surface area. This would limit the extent to which weathering agents can access and act upon the rock, thereby reducing the overall rate of weathering. Indirectly, the perturbation would impact various interconnected natural processes. For example, if rocks were to remain as large pieces and not weather as quickly, water and wind erosion might take on a more significant role in shaping the landscape. Additionally, ecosystems that rely on the weathering and breakdown of rocks to provide essential nutrients and minerals may be adversely affected by the reduced rate of weathering. This could result in changes to plant and animal populations, as well as shifts in species composition within these ecosystems. Moreover, the perturbation could lead to an increase in mechanical weathering, such as abrasion and exfoliation, as rocks continue to be exposed to the elements without the opportunity to break and split through freeze-thaw processes. Chemical weathering processes like hydrolysis, oxidation, and dissolution could also be impacted, but the extent of this impact would likely depend on the type of rock and the specific environmental conditions. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if rocks were to remain in large pieces, the rate of weathering would be slowed down. This is primarily due to the reduced surface area available for weathering agents to act upon. The perturbation would have both direct and indirect effects on the weathering process, with direct effects primarily centered around limiting the exposure of rock surfaces to weathering agents and indirect effects encompassing changes to interrelated natural processes such as soil formation, erosion, and nutrient cycling within ecosystems."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The HFP aims to offer affordable health insurance to children who currently lack coverage and do not meet the eligibility requirements for no-cost Medi-Cal, which is California's Medicaid program. The primary goal of the program is to provide better access to healthcare services for these children, thereby helping to address health disparities among California's low-income populations. The HFP offers comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage to enrolled children, ensuring they have access to essential healthcare services. This includes, but is not limited to, routine check-ups, immunizations, preventive care, mental health services, dental care, and vision care. By addressing potential health issues early on, the program helps prevent more severe and costly health problems in the long run. Eligibility for HFP is determined by factors such as household income, family size, and immigration status. The program is designed to help families who may not be able to afford private insurance but have an income too high to qualify for Medi-Cal. HFP enrollment is open year-round, allowing families to apply for coverage at any time. To help keep healthcare costs manageable for eligible families, monthly premiums, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket expenses are determined on a sliding scale based on household income. This ensures that the financial burden of healthcare remains proportional to a family's ability to pay, so that low-income families can still afford the necessary care for their children. In conclusion, HFP is an acronym that stands for the California Healthy Families Program, a state-specific implementation of the federal Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Its purpose is to provide low-cost health, dental, and vision insurance coverage to children in California who do not have insurance and do not qualify for no-cost Medi-Cal, ultimately improving healthcare access and outcomes for vulnerable populations in the state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is Paragraph: Robert is generating waves using an oscilloscope in his high school physics class.

When Robert creates the short waves, he will observe that more waves of this kind will pass by in a given amount of time, which directly translates to a higher frequency. On the other hand, the longer wavelengths of the long waves will result in a lower frequency, as fewer waves will pass by in the same amount of time. In conclusion, the short waves, with their shorter wavelengths, will have a higher frequency than the long waves featuring longer wavelengths. This difference in frequency is a direct consequence of the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, as demonstrated in the background information and the wave properties observed by Robert in his high school physics class."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

Q:Information: - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - Examples. Typically, Lieder are arranged for a single singer and piano, the Lied with orchestral accompaniment being a later development. Some of the most famous examples of Lieder are Schubert's \\"Der Tod und das Mädchen\\" (\\"Death and the Maiden\\"), \\"Gretchen am Spinnrade\\", and \\"Der Doppelgänger\\". Sometimes Lieder are gathered in a \\"\\" or \\"song cycle\\", a series of songs (generally three or more) tied by a single narrative or theme, such as Schubert's \\"Die schöne Müllerin\\" and \\"Winterreise\\", or Robert Schumann's \\"Frauenliebe und -leben\\" and \\"Dichterliebe\\". Schubert and Schumann are most closely associated with this genre, mainly developed in the Romantic era . - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Op. 28, is a tone poem written in 189495 by Richard Strauss. It chronicles the misadventures and pranks of the German peasant folk hero Till Eulenspiegel, who is represented by two themes. The first, played by the horn, is a lilting melody that reaches a peak, falls downward, and ends in three long, loud notes, each progressively lower. The second, for D clarinet, is crafty and wheedling, suggesting a trickster doing what he does best. - An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers. - Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition. - Metamorphosen, study for 23 solo strings (TrV 290, AV 142) is a composition by Richard Strauss, scored for ten violins, five violas, five cellos, and three double basses. It was composed during the closing months of the Second World War, from August 1944 to March 1945. The piece was commissioned by Paul Sacher, the founder and director of the Basler Kammerorchester and Collegium Musicum Zürich, to whom Strauss dedicated it. It was first performed in 25 January 1946 by Sacher and the Collegium Musicum Zürich, with Strauss conducting the final rehearsal. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Composition history. Work on the opera began in 1911. Hofmannsthals earliest sketches for the libretto are based on a piece by Goethe, \\"The Conversation of German Emigrants\\" (1795). Hofmannsthal handles Goethe's material freely, adding the idea of two couples, the emperor and empress who come from another realm, and the dyer and his wife who belong to the ordinary world. Hofmannsthal also drew on portions of the Arabian Nights, Grimms' Fairy Tales, and even quotes Goethe's Faust. The opera is conceived as a fairy-tale on the theme of love blessed through the birth of children. Hofmannsthal, in his letters, compared it with Mozart's \\"Magic Flute\\", which has a similar arrangement of two couples. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - Richard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 8 September 1949) was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\", \\"Elektra\\", \\"Die Frau ohne Schatten\\" and \\"Salome\\"; his Lieder, especially his \\"Four Last Songs\\"; his tone poems, including \\"Don Juan\\", \\"Death and Transfiguration\\", \\"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks\\", \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\", \\"Ein Heldenleben\\", \\"Symphonia Domestica\\", and \\"An Alpine Symphony\\"; and other instrumental works such as \\"Metamorphosen\\" and his Oboe Concerto. Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. - An Alpine Symphony (\\"Eine Alpensinfonie\\"), Op. 64, is a tone poem written by German composer Richard Strauss in 1915. Though labelled as a symphony by the composer, this piece forgoes the conventions of the traditional multi-movement symphony and consists of twenty-two continuous sections of music. The story of \\"An Alpine Symphony\\" depicts the experiences of eleven hours (from daybreak just before dawn to the following nightfall) spent climbing an Alpine mountain. \\"An Alpine Symphony\\" is one of Strauss's largest non-operatic works in terms of performing forces: the score calls for about 125 players in total. A typical performance usually lasts around 50 minutes. - The Four Last Songs, Op. posth., for soprano and orchestra are, with the exception of the song \\"Malven\\" (Mallows) composed later the same year, the final completed works of Richard Strauss, composed in 1948 when the composer was 84. - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. - Death and Transfiguration, Op. 24, is a tone poem for large orchestra by Richard Strauss. Strauss began composition in the late summer of 1888 and completed the work on 18 November 1889. The work is dedicated to the composer's friend Friedrich Rosch. - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. - Prima la musica e poi le parole ( First the music and then the words ) , also called Prima la musica , poi le parole is an opera in one act by Antonio Salieri to a libretto by Giovanni Battista Casti . The work was first performed on 7 February 1786 in Vienna , following a commission by the Emperor Joseph II. The opera ( more specifically , a divertimento teatrale ) was first performed at one end of the orangery of the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna by an Italian troupe : simultaneously , Mozart 's Der Schauspieldirektor was staged at the other end . The title of the opera is the theme of Richard Strauss 's opera Capriccio which debates the relative importance of music and drama in opera . - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. - The opera has four main characters: the aristocratic Marschallin, her very young lover Count Octavian Rofrano, her coarse cousin Baron Ochs and Ochs' prospective fiancée Sophie von Faninal, daughter of a rich bourgeois. At the Marschallin's suggestion Ochs gets Octavian to act as his \\"Rosenkavalier\\" and present the ceremonial silver rose to Sophie. But when Octavian meets Sophie they fall in love at first sight. By a comic intrigue they get rid of Ochs with the help of the Marschallin, who then yields Octavian to the younger woman. Although a comic opera, \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\" also operates at a deeper level. Conscious of the difference in age between herself and Octavian, the Marschallin muses in bittersweet fashion over the passing of time, growing old and men's inconstancy. - Ein Heldenleben (\\"A Hero's Life\\"), Op. 40 is a tone poem by Richard Strauss. The work was completed in 1898. It was his sixth work in the genre, and exceeded any of its predecessors in its orchestral demands. Generally agreed to be autobiographical in nature, despite contradictory statements on the matter by the composer, the work contains more than thirty quotations from Strauss's earlier works, including Also sprach Zarathustra, Till Eulenspiegel, and Death and Transfiguration. - Symphonia Domestica (\\"Domestic Symphony\\"), Op. 53, is a tone poem for large orchestra by Richard Strauss. The work is a musical reflection of the secure domestic life so valued by the composer himself and, as such, harmoniously conveys daily events and family life.

The country specified here is Italy. For additional context, Spoleto is a small city in the Italian region called Umbria, which is in central Italy. Known for its rich history and dynamic culture, Spoleto is an important site of Italian history and is well-known for its many Roman and medieval structures, including the Roman theatre, the Roman House, and the Duomo cathedral. Furthermore, the notion of sister cities, as referenced in the given statement, illuminates a form of legal and social agreements made between towns in geographically and politically distinct areas to promote cultural and commercial ties. Therefore, the reference to Charleston's relationship with Spoleto as sister cities underscores the cultural and economic exchanges that have been established between the two. In the sister-city relationship established in 1984, Spoleto was recognized because of Spoleto's \\"Festival of the Two Worlds\\". Inspired by this event, Charleston later created its own annual Spoleto Festival USA, held in the late spring, which features a wide array of performances by talented artists in various disciplines, from opera, theater and music, to dance, visual arts and more. In summary, the country in which Spoleto is located is Italy, and more specifically, it is situated in the Umbria region. This information is clearly provided in the sentence \\"Charleston has one official sister city, Spoleto, Umbria, Italy.\\" Alongside this, the context of 'sister cities', along with the specific example of Spoleto being named Charleston's sister city due to the cultural significance of Spoleto's festival and its influence on Charleston, offers additional depth to the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This height is classified as a longboard. These tall boards are great for beginners, since they're typically more stable and better for catching small waves. Sentence: Longboards have a maximum height of 8 foot","completion":"The sentence \\"Longboards have a maximum height of 8 foot\\" is not entirely true. While the given text does mention an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall surfboard as a longboard, it does not specifically state that this is the maximum height for a longboard. In reality, longboards come in various lengths, with many ranging from 8 to over 11 feet (2.4 to 3.4 meters) in length. Longboard surfboards are, indeed, popular among beginners because their longer lengths typically provide greater stability and make it easier to catch small waves. However, longboards are also used by experienced surfers, as they allow for different maneuvering styles and might be preferred for certain wave conditions. The ideal length of a longboard can vary depending on the surfer's skill level, weight, height, and the specific type of longboarding they want to do. In summary, the text supports the idea that an 8-foot surfboard can be classified as a longboard.

On a grassy plain in South Africa,thousands of miles from home,two pairs of Zoo--bred South China tiger cubs----one-year-o1d Hope and Cathay and six-month-old Tiger Woods and Madonna--are learning to hunt in the wild.The hope is that they will one day pass on their skills to their young,allowing the next generation to get back to wildlife reserves in China. A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters.

Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \\"Best bedchamber\\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service..., can you guess it ?

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who dreamed of a normal life? When Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche escaped Tibet in 1959, he settled in Italy, where he married and had two children, of which Yeshi was the first. Yeshi was recognized as the reincarnation of Rinpoche's uncle, a renowned Dzogchen master, who had died after the Chinese invaded Tibet. Yeshi grew up in Italy and wanted nothing to do with this legacy. He had no interest in being a teacher like his father. Nor did he want to return to Tibet and the monastery of Rinpoche's uncle to meet the students waiting for him since his birth – something that his father continually admonished him to do. Instead, he dreamed of a normal life, away from the hordes of devoted students that always surrounded his father. Through intimate scenes Yeshi is shown growing from 18 years old to 39 years old and maturity, and his father who begins the story in his 50-year-old prime ages to 70 years and his senior years. As the story unravels, what is at stake for Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche is his spiritual tradition, for Yeshi it is his own identity. Will Yeshi's Western lifestyle replace his family tradition and his spiritual roots? Will his father succeed at transplanting the vanishing Tibetan heritage to the Western world? As time moves forward, both father and son begin to change. The image of water and swimming, Namkhai Norbu's beloved pastime, is used as a repetitive thematic pillar through the film as a representation of his teachings of integration and emptiness. The natural sounds of chanting and song, combined with added effects and carefully scored music, is used to express a non-verbal sense of the spiritual world Norbu Rinpoche seeks to transmit to his son, and to the West.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: how to clean red wine from carpet Select from: 1). use club crackers 2). use club soda","completion":"Your best option here is to use club soda. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean red wine from a carpet using club soda: 1. **Act Quickly**: The key to removing a red wine stain is to act as quickly as possible. The faster you can treat the stained area, the more successful you will be. 2. **Blot the Stain:** As soon as the spill occurs, grab a clean, dry cloth or paper towel and begin blotting the stain. Always blot - don't scrub or you'll push the wine deeper into the carpet fibers. Blot from the outside in to prevent the stain from spreading. 3. **Apply Cold Water:** After blotting up as much of the wine as possible, pour a bit of cold water directly onto the wine stain. This helps dilute the remaining wine in the carpet. Blot again with a clean cloth to soak up as much of the diluted wine as possible. 4. **Apply Club Soda:** Now, pour a liberal amount of club soda over the stained area. The carbonation of the club soda helps lift the wine stain from the carpet fibers, while the salt in the soda can act as a buffer to help prevent the stain from setting. 5. **Continue Blotting:** Use another clean dry cloth to blot up the club soda and wine. Continue this process until the stain is no longer visible. 6. **Apply a Carpet Cleaner:** Even after following the above process, it may be beneficial to treat the area with a carpet cleaning solution. Whether you choose a store-bought cleaner or a DIY mixture of white vinegar and liquid dish soap, apply this to the area following the product's specific instructions. 7. **Rinse and Dry:** After you've thoroughly cleaned the area, rinse it with cool water and blot with a dry towel until as dry as possible. You can also put a stack of paper towels with a weight on top (like a heavy book) and leave it overnight to absorb any remaining moisture. 8. **Consult a Professional**: If the stain is being stubborn or it's on a treasured or expensive carpet, you might need to consult a professional cleaner to make sure the stain is removed without damaging the carpet. Using club crackers to clean red wine from a carpet is not typically advised. While they may be useful for soaking up excess wine, they won't remove the stain and might even grind it further into the carpet fibers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which three countries were in an alliance to push the Turks south in 1686?","completion":"The three countries that formed an alliance to push the Turks south in 1686 were Austria, Poland, and Russia. This alliance was born out of a common goal to reclaim territories and halt the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The partnership was initiated by Austria and Poland after the Turkish disaster at the Battle of Vienna in September 1683, marking a turning point in the 300-year struggle between the forces of Central Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, Russia joined the coalition in 1686, expanding the collective military effort against the Turks. This mutual collaboration set off a series of key military engagements. However, initial attempts on the part of these allied forces yielded mixed results. For instance, in the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689, Russia's endeavor to invade Crimea proved unsuccessful. Nevertheless, by 1695, Russia was making some progress by trying to seize forts along the lower Dnieper. The conclusion to the hostilities came with the treaties of 1699/1700. In these agreements, the Ottoman Empire underwent significant territorial losses: Hungary fell to Austria; Podolia was ceded to Poland; and Azov was handed over to Russia, although this was a temporary arrangement. These treaties and subsequent losses marked a setback for the Ottomans and affirmed the combined might of the Austro-Polish-Russian alliance.

A journalist, Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go.

The opening shots show Xanadu, Kane's vast, elaborate, and now unkempt estate in Florida. Interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death. Most puzzling are his last moments: clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word \\"rosebud.\\" Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure. The newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what Rosebud is they won't have the whole story on Kane. He assigns a reporter called Thompson (William Alland) to investigate Rosebud.Thompson digs into Kane's life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal the meaning of Rosebud. The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the tycoon's ex-wife; she's drunk and won't speak to him. Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris), Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks. In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections. When Charles objected violently to being sent away with Thatcher, Kane Sr. remarked, \\"what the kid needs is a good thrashing.\\" Mrs. Kane responded, \\"That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.\\" (Some present-day fans of the film interpret this to mean that Mr. Kane was abusive. 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that Mrs. Kane was over-protective and that if Charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents, his life would have turned out better.)Years later, as he was about to get control of his business affairs, Kane's interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling New York Daily Inquirer.

Q:Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more chance of a negative charge happens, how will it affect LESS or LESS POWERFUL lightning. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If there is a higher chance of a negative charge occurring, it could potentially lead to less or less powerful lightning under certain conditions. In the lightning formation process, as you've mentioned, electrostatic charges result from ice particles bumping into each other within a cloud. Generally, a strong negative charge accumulates at the base of the thundercloud, with positive charges at the top. Meanwhile, the ground beneath the cloud accumulates a positive charge in response to the cloud's negative charge. For a lightning discharge to occur, the electrical potential between the negative charge in the cloud and the positive charge on the ground must be substantial enough to overcome the air's insulating properties. If there is a higher chance of a negative charge developing in the cloud, it doesn't necessarily mean that the lightning will be less or less powerful by default. The effect of this increased negative charge would depend on the accompanying positive charges in the cloud and on the ground. If the higher concentration of negative charges doesn't result in a corresponding increase in positive charges (either in the cloud or on the ground), it might hamper the development of the necessary electrical potential for a lightning strike. In this case, lightning could become less frequent or less powerful, as the charges may not reach the threshold needed to initiate a discharge. On the contrary, if the imbalance between negative and positive charges results in a stronger attraction between oppositely charged regions, it could increase the likelihood of lightning strikes or result in more powerful lightning, as the energy released in overcoming the insulation properties of the air would be greater. Thus, the perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the lightning process, but the outcome would depend on various factors, such as the distribution of positive charges in the cloud and the ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to help Alex feel more comfortable and warm, Remy found an extra blanket in the ottoman and covered Alex with it. Now, considering the options provided: A: become warmer - This answer seems to address the situation directly. By providing an extra blanket to cover Alex, Remy is helping to provide additional insulation for Alex's body. This extra insulation will prevent further heat loss and help trap the body's generated heat, allowing Alex's body temperature to slowly increase. As a result, Alex's shivering will decrease, and they will feel warmer and more comfortable. B: be loved - While it is evident that Remy's actions show care and support for Alex, this answer does not directly address the physical response that will occur in Alex's body due to the extra blanket. C: be thanked - This answer refers to a potential emotional or social response from Alex as a result of Remy's helpful actions, but it does not relate to the physical response of Alex's body to the added warmth provided by the extra blanket.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: The people who beat Demetrius were from Epirus and where? Context: After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years. Answer:","completion":"The people who beat Demetrius were from Epirus and Thrace. This is justified in the context where it says \\"He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon\\".

A female goose now has a large family of chicks, the chicks mostly fend for themselves and can move around almost immediately after being born. A short way away a female dog gives birth to a litter of puppies. These on the other hand are defenseless, cant really move and are blind. They require extensive care from their mother. Hint: Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction rate. Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: One of the first things you should start with is to teach the alphabet and numbers. By teaching the alphabet and numbers, you’ll create a great foundation for everything else that your students will learn. Have your students learn the alphabet to a certain point. You can start at \\"a\\" and go to \\"m,\\" if you want. Have your students finish the alphabet at a pace you are both comfortable with. The point is to push your students but to not push them too hard. Ask your students to work on numbers. As with letters, start them and stop them depending on their capabilities. Consider creating a worksheet on which students can practice writing letters and/or numbers. Use flashcards with a word that begins with each letter of the alphabet to reinforce your lesson. Learning the alphabet might be easier to speakers whose native language uses the Latin or English alphabet. Teaching pronunciation is extremely important when teaching English as a second language. Consider focusing on sounds that are particularly hard for English as a second language students like: The \\"TH.\\" The \\"TH\\" (like in \\"theater\\" or \\"thing\\") does not exist in a number of languages. As a result, it's relatively hard for some ESL students (such as those from Romance or Slavic language backgrounds) to pronounce. The \\"R.\\" The \\"R\\" sound is also difficult for many ESL learners for a variety of reason including the fact that it is pronounced differently depending on regional dialects. The \\"L.\\" The \\"L\\" sound is another difficult one for ESL learners, especially those from east Asia. Spend extra time on the \\"L.\\" The \\"H.\\" The \\"H\\" sound is difficult for many ESL learners, especially Spanish speakers who are used to the letter being silent. In English, it's usually pronounced, but it may confuse students when it appears in \\"gh,\\" as in \\"laugh,\\" or \\"sh,\\" as in \\"fish.\\" After teaching the alphabet and numbers, move on to nouns. Teaching nouns will be one of the easiest things for your students to learn. This is because your students will be able to look at everything around them as potential things to learn. Start with common objects in your classroom. Move on to common objects in your city or town. Good examples are: car, house, tree, road, and more. Continue on to objects your students will encounter in their daily lives, such as food, electronics, and more. Adjectives allow you to describe nouns, so they're important for good communication. It's helpful to teach adjectives right after you teach nouns because adjectives are used exclusively with nouns. Adjectives change or describe other words. Examples of adjectives you can teach are: wild, silly, troubled, and agreeable. Teaching verbs will be a huge step in the process in which your students will put together full sentences (written or spoken). Verbs describe an action. Examples of verbs you can teach are: to speak, to talk, and to pronounce. Spend extra time on irregular verbs. The word \\"go\\" is a great example of a difficult English irregular verb. The past tense of \\"go\\" is \\"went.\\" The past participle of \\"go\\" becomes \\"gone.\\" Adverbs allow you to add extra details to your sentence. Your students can use adverbs to clarify how or to what degree they did something. They can also use adverbs to add more detail when using adjectives to describe a noun. Adverbs describe or change the meaning of verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs, adding to their meaning. Examples of adverbs include very, wearily, happily, and easily. If a word ends in -ly, it's likely an adverb. After you’ve covered nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs you need to move on to teaching tenses and articles to your students. Without understanding how to use the proper tense and where to use articles, your students will not be able to put whole sentences together. Tenses explain when something has happened or occurred. Make sure to explain past tense, current tense, and future tense. Articles are adjectives that provide extra information about a noun. Articles include: \\"a,\\" \\"an,\\" and \\"the.\\" Make sure your students master tenses and articles, as they are paramount in their ability to construct sentences and to speak properly. One great way to teach English is to encourage your students to practice and use common phrases. This is important, as your students won’t understand the meaning of many common phrases just based off of the literal meaning of the words. You should tell your students to repeat those phrases (and use them) until they feel comfortable using them in conversation. Begin with a few common phrases like “never mind,” “no doubt,” or “make believe.” Provide your students with a list of common phrases to work with and think about. After you've taught the alphabet, verbs, and more, you should begin to teach your students basic sentence construction. This is important, as it will provide a foundation to their writing ability. It will also aid them in reading. Teach the main five patterns that sentences in English are constructed around: Subject-Verb sentences. These sentences have the subject followed by a verb. For instance, \\"The Dog runs.\\" Subject-Verb-Object. These sentences have the subject first, followed by a verb, which is then followed by an object. For instance, \\"John eats pizza.\\" Subject-Verb-Adjective sentences. These sentences have the subject first, a verb, and then an adjective. For instance, \\"The puppy is cute.\\" Subject-Verb-Adverb sentences. These sentences have the subject, a verb, and then an adverb. For instance, \\"The lion is there.\\" Subject-Verb-Noun sentences. These sentences have a subject, a verb, and end with a noun. For instance, \\"Emmanuel is a philosopher.\\" What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about teaching English to students.

I was familiar with Lisa from her show on Lifetime, and since I was eager to get a sign from my father, I agreed to go. I took my father's gold watch and listened as Lisa helped audience members communicate with their loved ones. \\"I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,\\" she announced. The audience was quiet; no one raised a hand. I nudged my sister and whispered to her that this was Dad ,for my third child and my father had a deep bond(,) and he called her Jilly. Although I sensed his presence, I wasn't confident enough to raise my hand. I needed something a bit more concrete, something undoubted. \\"This man is letting me know he had cancer,\\" she continued. I nudged my sister harder and assured her this was our father. Lisa went on to say that this person died in June (my father had died June 8th). There was swelling of the legs. \\"Important information,\\" she called out. My heart beat fast .

From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Which tetrapod would live shorter, tetA or tetB? The answer to this question is:","completion":"According to Aristotle's theory, tetrapod characteristics are interrelated, such that heavier species with longer gestation periods also have longer lifespans. In this case, tetA is heavier and has a longer gestation period than tetB. Based on Aristotle's observations, it can be inferred that tetA would have a longer lifespan compared to tetB.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Stuart Hogg's long-range penalty put the hosts ahead before Finn Russell finished off heavy pressure to score. Replacement Matt Scott touched down the second for a 15-0 lead, with Italy's Carlo Canna missing three penalties. The Azzurri botched two scoring chances before further tries from Tim Visser and Tommy Seymour sealed a bonus point. Four tries brought Scotland's tally for the championship to 14, surpassing their record, set last year, of 11 for a Six Nations campaign. Despite their three victories, the Scots had to settle for a repeat of last year's fourth-place finish, on points difference, after victories for France against Wales, and Ireland over England. This was a 12th Six Nations defeat in a row for Italy, who finished with the Wooden Spoon for a 12th time in 18 seasons. In the Edinburgh rain, mistakes were inevitable but the opening half was an error and penalty-fest, a grind that Scotland slowly but surely took control of. Italy were a creative desert, a line-out horror-show, a goal-kicking nightmare. They lost four of eight line-outs in the first 40 minutes and missed three out of three kicks at goal. Two of those were straightforward, but Canna made a hash of both. Scotland were ahead with a booming Hogg penalty, but the hosts had serious problems of their own despite having the lead. Referee Pascal Gauzere got on their case early and he kept pinging them all day long. The Scots conceded five penalties in the opening 20 minutes, seven in the first 40 and a stratospheric 12 by the early minutes of the second half. Of course, they also had a healthy lead by then. The first came at the end of mountainous pressure, Ali Price eventually put Russell over in the corner. The downside was that they lost Huw Jones to injury in the creation of the score, Scott replacing him. Unlike poor Canna, Russell's kick was good and Scotland were ahead 10-0. Canna missed a second sitter and, soon after, Scotland had a second try when Price chipped over the top close to the Italian line for Hogg to win the aerial dual against Giovanbattista Venditti and bat the ball back into Scott's path. The centre had the easiest job in dotting it down. Scotland had battled their way into the lead with the knowledge that Italy's second-half performances have been a calamity in this Six Nations. Before this game they conceded 70% of their points in the second half and an average of 20 points in the last 20 minutes of the second half. It was Italy who came back strong, though. They camped themselves in the Scottish 22, forced Hogg into making a try-saver on Angelo Esposito, then went again. They won penalty after penalty. John Barclay disappeared to the bin and they won more penalties after that. When it looked like they were about to break through, Edoardo Padovani knocked on with the line at his mercy. It was painful stuff for the visitors. They were undone by Scotland's defence, yes, but mostly by their own lack of wit. Italy had a chronic lack of imagination and accuracy. Just after the hour, Scotland got their third try when Hogg scampered up the left wing, chipped ahead and Visser got the touchdown. Russell's conversion made it 22-0. For them, it was all about the four-try bonus point now. Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland started to hit their stride and the crucial fourth try came after multiple phases drained the life out of the tiring Italians, Russell's lovely hands finding Hogg who put Seymour over. Once again Russell, kicking beautifully, was successful with the conversion. Job done for Scotland. A third win in a championship that has seen them score more points (122) and more tries than they have ever done in the Six Nations. A decent farewell to Cotter, a man who has done so much to take the Scots from despair to hope.

Sherman Joseph Alexie, Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist, short story writer, poet, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. Alexie was born on October 7, 1966, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Colville, Choctaw, Spokane and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the cranial cavity. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but had other side effects. His parents were alcoholics though his mother was a sober alcoholic. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs. Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids as well as endured abuse he described as \\"torture\\" from teachers who were white nuns. They called him \\"The Globe\\" because his head was larger than usual, due to the hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them. Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males. Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals. Entity:","completion":"Sherman Joseph Alexie, Jr."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Niko Nirvi ( born 1961 ) is a long - term major icon in the Finnish gaming world . He is well known for writing computer game reviews since the 1980s in MikroBitti , C = Lehti and the computer game yearbooks that were predecessors of the Pelit magazine . He has worked for the latter since its founding in 1992 , and holds a column in addition to making reviews and other reports . Nirvi began his career as a game reviewer in 1986 on pages of MikroBitti . He had made a bet with his friend that he could get his review published in the magazine . He sent two reviews , Zoids and Uridium and the former was published ( they already had one Uridium review ) . Nirvi wrote reviews and a regular column about new games for Mikrobitti and became the \`\` game editor '' of the magazine . He also wrote reviews for C = Lehti . When Pelit , that concentrated solely on gaming , was founded by the same publisher , Nirvi joined its ranks as an editor , and has written a regular column for each issue . Trademarks of his are signing with \`\` Nnirvi '' or a variation , and never showing his face in the magazine . Photos of him are always either covered or edited in a way that the face is unrecognizable . His personal picture in his articles is usually a gaming or movie character whose face is blurred ( for example Master Chief ) while the rest of the crew 's articles feature their real faces . Wallu 's drawings of Nirvi depict him as a bearded man with Spock 's Vulcan ears . According to Nirvi , his avoidance of publicity started in 1988 , when a MikroBitti reader asked for a photograph of him , which Nirvi instantly declined , and this avoidance has strengthened ever since . Nirvi 's style is typically humorous , and sometimes unorthodox . Some of Nirvi 's most unconventional reviews were published in C = Lehti . The review of Domark 's motorboat game Hydra was written as a nursery rhyme from the beginning to the end . The review of Battle Island contained just two words : '' Paska Commando - klooni . \`\` ( '' shitty Commando clone \`\` ) . - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\". In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's). - Mikrobitti (formerly called \\"MB\\", \\"MikroBitti\\" and \\"MikroBITTI\\") is a Finnish computer magazine published in Finland.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In Praise of Small Miracles Most of us don’t save enough. When governments try to encourage saving, they usually enact big policies to increase the incentives. But, in Kenya, people were given a lockable metal box — a simple place to put their money. After one year, the people with metal boxes increased savings by so much that they had 66 percent more money available to pay for health emergencies. It would have taken a giant tax reform to produce a shift in behavior that large. Too many people die in auto accidents. When governments try to reduce highway deaths, they generally increase safety regulations. But, also in Kenya, stickers were placed inside buses and vans urging passengers to scream at automobile drivers they saw driving dangerously. The heckling discouraged dangerous driving by an awesome amount. Insurance claims involving injury or death fell to half of their previous levels. These are examples of a new kind of policy-making that is sweeping the world. The old style was based on the notion that human beings are rational actors who respond in straightforward ways to incentives. The new style, which supplements but does not replace the old style, is based on the obvious point that human beings are not always rational actors. Sometimes we’re mentally lazy, or stressed, or we’re influenced by social pressure and unconscious biases. It’s possible to take advantage of these features to enact change. For example, people hate losing things more than they like getting things, a phenomenon known as loss aversion. In some schools, teachers were offered a bonus at the end of their year if they could improve student performance. This kind of merit pay didn’t improve test scores. But, in other schools, teachers were given a bonus at the beginning of the year, which would effectively be taken away if their students didn’t improve. This loss-framed bonus had a big effect. People are also guided by decision-making formats. The people who administer the ACT college admissions test used to allow students to send free score reports to three colleges. Many people thus applied to three colleges. But then the ACT folks changed the form so there were four lines where you could write down prospective colleges. That tiny change meant that many people applied to four colleges instead of three. Some got into more prestigious schools they wouldn’t have otherwise. This improved the expected earnings of low-income students by about 10,000. The World Bank has just issued an amazingly good report called “Mind, Society and Behavior” on how the insights of behavioral economics can be applied to global development and global health. The report, written by a team led by Karla Hoff and Varun Gauri, lists many policies that have already been tried and points the way to many more. Sugar cane farmers in India receive most of their income once a year, at harvest time. In the weeks before harvest, when they are poor and stressed, they score 10 points lower on I.Q. tests than in the weeks after. If you schedule fertilizer purchase decisions and their children’s school enrollment decisions during the weeks after harvest, they will make more farsighted choices than at other times of the year. This simple policy change is based on an understanding of how poverty depletes mental resources. In Zambia, hairdressers were asked to sell female condoms to their clients. Some were offered financial incentives to do so, but these produced no results. In other salons, top condom sellers had a gold star placed next to their names on a poster that all could see. More than twice as many condoms were sold. This simple change was based on an understanding of the human desire for status and admiration. The policies informed by behavioral economics are delicious because they show how cheap changes can produce big effects. Policy makers in this mode focus on discrete opportunities to exploit, not vast problems to solve. This corrects for a bias in the way governments often work. They tend to gravitate toward the grand and the abstract. For example the United Nations is now replacing the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015, with the Sustainable Development Goals. “The Millennium Development Goals are concrete, measurable and have an end-date, so they could serve as a rallying point,” says Suprotik Basu, the chief executive of the MDG Health Alliance. “One good thing about the Sustainable Development Goals is that they’re being written through a bottom-up consensus process. But sometimes the search for consensus leads you higher and higher into the clouds. The jury is out on whether we will wind up with goals concrete enough to help ministers make decisions and decide priorities.” Behavioral economics policies are beautiful because they are small and concrete but powerful. They remind us that when policies are rooted in actual human behavior and specific day-to-day circumstances, even governments can produce small miracles.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Art of Excelling: Strategies to Cultivate Success in a Class or Team Setting Introduction Embarking on a new educational or sports experience can be both exciting and challenging. To maximize one's potential and make the most of that experience, it is vital to implement key practices that can significantly impact one's success. This article explores four essential strategies that can effectively contribute to growth and accomplishment in a class or team setting. 1. Finding the Right Class or Team The first step in the journey towards success is by selecting the appropriate class or team that aligns with one's goals and interests. This decision may be influenced by an individual's skill level, aspirations, and the sort of challenges they seek. To make an informed choice, it is necessary to conduct research about the available options and, when possible, observe the lessons or practices in person. This observation can provide valuable insight into the style, atmosphere, and attitudes within the group, aiding the decision-making process and increasing overall satisfaction. 2. Punctuality as a Key Ingredient Punctuality is a vital habit for those who wish to excel in any pursuit. Arriving on time demonstrates commitment, preparation, and respect for both the instructor or coach, as well as fellow team members or classmates. By being punctual, individuals can also ensure that they receive all necessary information and are given opportunities to participate in activities. Consequently, punctuality leads to stronger relationships within the group, and can also improve individual performance and development. 3. Hard Work and Perseverance Hard work and perseverance are fundamental components of growth and success in any field. It is crucial to consistently dedicate time and effort to the tasks and challenges at hand, and to maintain a relentless spirit in the face of difficulties. Putting forth one's best effort does not necessarily mean always being the fastest or scoring the highest. Rather, it is about pushing personal boundaries, refining skills, and striving to perform at an optimal level. This approach fosters personal growth and allows individuals to reach their full potential, whether it be in a classroom or on a sports team. 4. Seeking Guidance from Coaches and Instructors Lastly, one of the most effective ways to improve performance is to seek feedback from coaches or instructors. These professionals possess extensive knowledge and experience, making them an invaluable resource on the path to success. Asking for tips, advice, or clarification helps foster a better understanding and application of the material or skill set. Moreover, engaging in open communication with mentors establishes a supportive learning environment where questions are encouraged and growth can flourish. Conclusion In summary, success in a class or team setting is largely determined by the individual's willingness to find a well-suited environment, exhibit punctuality, work hard, and seek guidance from mentors. By incorporating these strategies, individuals can cultivate a strong foundation for personal growth and achievement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Start with the given equation: -9 = -b - 16 2. Next, the objective is to move the constant value (-16) from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we'll add 16 to both sides of the equation. Adding 16 to the left side will neutralize the -16 on the right side: -9 + 16 = -b - 16 + 16 3. Simplify both sides of the equation: 7 = -b 4. Now we have an equation with 7 equals negative b (7 = -b). We want to find the value of positive b, not negative b. So, we'll multiply or divide both sides of the equation by -1 to find the positive value of b: 7 × -1 = -b × -1 5.

Background: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.

(A) Sun (B) Black hole Choose the answer between \\"Sun\\" and \\"Black hole\\". A:","completion":"Black hole To give a detailed explanation, we first need to understand how gravity works and how the mass, size, and density of celestial objects affect it. Gravity is a force by which a planet or other celestial body attracts objects toward its center. The gravitational attraction between two objects depends on their mass and the distance between them. Larger and denser objects have a stronger gravitational effect, while objects that are farther apart have a weaker gravitational pull. This relationship is mathematically represented by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which says that the force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Now let's compare the sun and a black hole. The sun is a massive and immensely hot ball of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. Its diameter is around 1.4 million kilometers (860,000 miles), and it has a mass of about 2 x 10^30 kg. Due to its massive size, the sun has a strong gravitational pull, which is responsible for holding the solar system together. On the other hand, a black hole is a region in space where the force of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. Black holes are formed when a massive star collapses under its own gravity at the end of its life, creating an extremely dense core. The size of a black hole, in terms of the event horizon (the point beyond which nothing can escape), can vary significantly depending on the mass of the black hole. However, in general, black holes have much smaller sizes than the sun. Though black holes have smaller sizes than the sun, they possess greater mass and density, leading to a stronger gravitational pull. For instance, a stellar-mass black hole can have a mass 5-20 times greater than that of the sun, while its event horizon may be only tens of kilometers in diameter. This extreme concentration of mass into such a small volume gives black holes immense gravitational strength. Therefore, in the given logic test, the black hole will have the strongest gravity compared to the sun (answer B)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Solve 5*g + 12 = -3 for g.","completion":"To solve the equation 5*g + 12 = -3 for g, we will use the principles of algebra to isolate the variable g on one side of the equation. Step 1: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. Our goal is to isolate the term with the variable g (5*g) on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to eliminate the constant, which is 12, from the left side of the equation. We can accomplish this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation. 5*g + 12 - 12 = -3 - 12 This simplifies to: 5*g = -15 Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 5. Now that we have isolated the term with the variable g (5*g) on one side of the equation, we need to isolate the variable itself (g). Since the coefficient of g is 5, we will divide both sides of the equation by 5. (5*g) / 5 = (-15) / 5 This simplifies to: g = -3 So, the solution for the equation 5*g + 12 = -3 for g is g = -3."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: To find a company's dividend payout ratio, first find its net income for the time period you're analyzing (one year is the typical period for dividend payout ratio calculation). This information can be found in a company's income statement. To be clear, you’re looking for the company’s income after all expenses, including taxes, costs of doing business, depreciation, amortization, and interest. For example, let's say that Jim's Light Bulbs, a new company, earned 200,000 in its first year of business, but it had to spend 50,000 on the expenses mentioned above. In this case, the net income for Jim's Light Bulbs would be 200,000 - 50,000 = 150,000. Find the amount of money that the company paid out in the form of dividends during the time period you're analyzing. Dividends are payments that are given to the company's investors instead of being saved or re-invested in the company. Dividends aren't usually listed on the income statement but are included on the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. Let's say that Jim's Light Bulbs, being a relatively young company, decided to re-invest most of its net income by expanding its production capacity and only paid out 3,750 per quarter in dividends. In this case, we'll use 4 times 3,750 = 15,000 as our amount of dividends paid in the first year of business. Once you know how much a company has made in net income and paid out in dividends in a given time period, finding its dividend payout ratio is simple. Divide its dividend payments by its net income. The value you get is its dividend payout ratio. For Jim's Light Bulbs, we can find the dividend payout ratio by dividing 15,000 by 150,000, which is 0.10 (or 10%). This means that Jim's Light Bulbs paid out 10% of its earnings to its investors and invested the rest (90%) back into the company.","completion":"The article explains how to calculate a company's dividend payout ratio by dividing the total dividends paid by its net income, using an example from a fictional company called Jim's Light Bulbs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose cup of water is more dense? Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the narration and the hint, it can be assumed that when Steve requests for a glass of water with molecules far apart and Chris asks for water with molecules closer together, they are indirectly referring to the temperature of the water. In the case of water, molecular distance depends on the temperature; the warmer the water, the further apart the molecules move, and conversely, the colder the water, the closer together the molecules align. The waiter's confusion arises due to this unusual way of ordering water, as these two are essentially asking for water at different temperatures, a typical order being 'ice-cold' or 'room-temperature' water. However, they mention the molecular configuration of the water instead. Going by the explanation provided, Chris's water, with molecules closer together, would be colder than Steve's, as colder water implies the molecules are closer together. Contrary to most liquids, water's density increases as it cools down, reaching its highest at about 4 degrees Celsius. This temperature is above freezing point, hence the water is still in liquid state. It begins to decrease again if it continues to cool past this point and begins to freeze due to the formation of a crystalline structure making ice less dense than liquid water. Given that Chris’s water would be colder than Steve's and considering that the density of water increases with a decrease in temperature (upto 4°C), it can be deduced that Chris’s water would be denser than Steve’s. Therefore, the cup of water more dense would be that of Chris. Steve's water, being warmer, has its molecules further apart and hence would be less dense."},{"prompt":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Verb: The verb in the sentence is \\"hit.\\" Verbs are the action words that indicate what is happening in the sentence. They are also required for a sentence to be complete. 3. Object: The object of the sentence is \\"Deirdre.\\" The object is the person, place, or thing receiving the action of verb. In many sentences, an object is present, but it is not always required. 4. Prepositional phrase: The prepositional phrase in this sentence is \\"on the back,\\" with \\"on\\" being the preposition.

Process: - A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens - The steam fills the next piston, driving it up, and the other one down - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the water boils faster happens, how will it affect the steam is forced out the tank more slowly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process described. When the water boils faster, it implies that more heat energy is being transferred to the water, resulting in the generation of more steam in the tank in a shorter time span. This will have a direct impact on various variables within the system. Considering that the steam is forced out of the tank more slowly, it will have multiple consequences: 1. Pressure Buildup: If the rate at which steam is generated increases but the rate at which it is forced out of the tank decreases, there will be a pressure buildup within the sealed tank. The continuously increasing pressure within the tank can be potentially hazardous, and if the pressure exceeds the capacity of the tank, it could even lead to rupture or explosion. This pressure buildup will also impose additional stress on the valves and the connection points in the system. 2. Inefficient Energy Utilization: As more steam is created within the tank, the energy content increases. However, this energy is not effectively utilized, as the steam is released at a slower pace. This reduces the overall efficiency of the system, as more fuel is consumed to heat the water, but the impact on the pistons is not proportional. 3. Piston Motion: Due to the slower release of steam from the tank, the rate at which the pistons move up and down will be affected. When less steam is used to drive the pistons, their movement might become less forceful or slower. In case the pressure buildup becomes critical, it could even lead to a situation where the piston's valve does not close properly. 4. Water Level: Since more water is being converted into steam at a faster rate, the water level in the tank will decrease more quickly. To maintain the functionality of the process, it may require more frequent refilling, adding to the maintenance requirements. 5. Indirect Impact on Process: As it is not clear what purpose the pistons serve in this system, it can be inferred that the slower piston movement might impact their intended function, potentially reducing the overall effectiveness of the process for which the steam generation and piston motion were designed. In summary, the perturbation of faster boiling water and slower steam release has several direct and indirect effects on the process, including pressure buildup, inefficient energy utilization, altered piston motion, changes in water level, and potential impacts on the intended function of the pistons. It is essential to address these changes in the process and maintain a balance between steam generation and release to ensure safe and efficient operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was managed by Colomby? from the following article ? In 1951, Thelonious Monk was convicted of narcotics possession after refusing to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police; a police search of the car belonging to Powell's female companion had discovered his glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet. The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of the pianist's music. With the residency, he had finally found jazz stardom after twenty years of career struggles and obscurity.Monk began his first stint at the venue in July 1957, with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time it ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left in pursuit of a solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. Monk...

Light a candle by taking the lighter and placing it next to the candle wick. (b). Light a candle by igniting the lighter and placing it next to the candle wick.","completion":"Option (b). Light a candle by igniting the lighter and placing it next to the candle wick makes more sense to accomplish this goal. Here is the detailed process to safely light a candle using a lighter: 1. Set up candle: Place the candle on a stable, heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials (curtains, paper, etc.) and any drafty areas. Ensure that the candle is upright and steady in its holder. 2. Trim the wick: If the wick is longer than 6mm (about 1/4 inch), use a pair of scissors or wick trimmer to trim it down to this length. This helps prevent excess smoke, soot, and tall flames when lighting the candle. 3. Prepare the lighter: Make sure that the lighter contains enough fuel for ignition. If you have a disposable lighter, make sure it is not expired or out of fuel. If you are using a refillable lighter, ensure it is adequately filled with lighter fluid or butane, depending on the type. 4. Ignite the lighter: Begin by holding the lighter in your dominant hand. With your thumb or index finger, press down on the ignition button to produce a flame at the end of the lighter. If you're using a lighter with a safety switch, make sure to slide the safety switch into the \\"unlock\\" position before pressing down on the ignition button. 5. Light the candle: While holding the ignited lighter, slowly bring the flame near the candle wick. Hold the flame to the tip of the wick until it catches fire and starts burning steadily. It's crucial not to touch the wick or wax with the lighter's metal parts, as this can cause the lighter to overheat or transfer contaminants to the wick and wax. 6. Carefully remove the lighter: Once you see the candle wick burning on its own, gently pull the lighter away from the heat. If you're using a retractable lighter, the flame will go out when you release the ignition button. 7. Extinguish the lighter: If you are using a lighter that doesn't have a self-extinguishing feature, make sure to safely extinguish the flame. For traditional lighters with a lid, close the lid to starve the flame of oxygen. For safety lighters, slide the safety switch back into the locked position. 8. Observe the burning candle: Always keep an eye on the burning candle to ensure it's burning evenly and safely. If the flame gets too high or the candle becomes smokey, extinguish it, let it cool, and trim the wick to the appropriate length before relighting. Remember to follow proper safety precautions and never leave a burning candle unattended to minimize the risk of accidents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. A:","completion":"The missing first step of this process is actually the inhalation or inspiration phase of breathing. Therefore, the complete process would look like this: 1. Inhalation: This is the missing first step. Inhalation is initiated by the diaphragm and supported by the external intercostal muscles. During this process, you breathe in the air that contains oxygen. When you inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward, creating more space in your chest cavity and allowing the lungs to expand. 2. Entry into the lungs: The inhaled air, which contains oxygen, enters the lungs. It gets into the lungs through the nose or mouth, going down the trachea (or windpipe), and then divides into two bronchi - each entering one lung (left and right). The air continues to travel down smaller and smaller branches of bronchi until it reaches the tiniest bronchial tubes. 3. Filling of the sacs in the lungs: The oxygen from the inhaled air fills tiny air sacs, known as alveoli, in the lungs. These small, balloon-like structures are where the gas exchange happens. The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin (1 cell thick) and are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels, or capillaries. 4. Gas exchange: During this process, the oxygen in the air sacs, or alveoli, moves across the thin walls and enters the bloodstream in the capillaries, attaching to red blood cells, specifically to a molecule called hemoglobin. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, moves from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 5. Exhalation: At this stage, the carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled. Just like the inhalation process but in reverse, the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles relax and the lungs shrink expelling the air that carries out carbon dioxide from your body. 6. Oxygen pass throughout the body: After the exchange at the capillaries, the oxygenated blood is carried away from the lungs and circulated by the heart to all the cells throughout the body where it enables cellular respiration, providing energy to the body's tissues. This entire mechanism is under the control of the respiratory center at the base of the brain and operates continuously, repeated thousands of times a day, allowing us to stay alive and function."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The death of a life partner may trigger an irregular heartbeat, itself potentially life-threatening, said new research (AFP Photo/Gerard Julien) More Paris (AFP) - The death of a life partner may trigger an irregular heartbeat, itself potentially life-threatening, said new research Wednesday into the risk of dying from a broken heart. A trawl of data on nearly a million Danes showed an elevated risk, lasting about a year, of developing a heart flutter. Under-60's whose partners died unexpectedly were most in peril. The risk was highest \\"8-14 days after the loss, after which it gradually declined,\\" said a study published in the online journal Open Heart. \\"One year after the loss, the risk was almost the same as in the non-bereaved population.\\" Much research has focused on explaining the observed phenomenon of people dying soon after their life partner. Several studies have shown that grieving spouses have a higher risk of dying, particularly of heart disease and stroke, but the mechanism is unclear. The latest study asked specifically whether bereaved partners were more likely than others to develop atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat and a risk factor for stroke and heart failure. Researchers in Denmark used population data collected between 1995 and 2014 to search for a pattern. Of the group, 88,612 people had been newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 886,120 were healthy. \\"(T)he risk of developing an irregular heartbeat for the first time was 41 percent higher among those who had been bereaved than it was among those who had not experienced such a loss,\\" said the study. Younger people, those under 60, were more than twice as likely to develop problems, and those whose partners were relatively healthy in the month before death, thus not expected to die, were 57 percent more at risk. The team cautioned that no conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, as the study was merely an observational one, looking at correlations in data. Several factors that could throw the findings out of whack, such as the bereaved group's diet, exercise regime, or predisposal to AF, were not known. The loss of a partner is considered one of the most stressful life events. It can lead to mental illness symptoms such as depression, and can cause people to lose sleep and appetite, drink too much and stop exercising -- all known health risks. ||||| The death of a life partner can throw your heart out of whack -- not just emotionally but physically, according to a new study. Researchers found that people who lost their partner within the previous 30 days are 41% more likely to develop an irregular heartbeat compared with those who were not recently bereaved. And it appears that the more unexpected the death, the higher the risk of a fluttering heart. People under 60 were the most affected by the recent loss of a partner: Their risk of having an irregular heartbeat doubled compared with control groups. The risk of developing arrhythmia also increased for those who had a partner who died suddenly compared with those whose partners died after a long illness. The study also suggests that just as time can heal an emotionally broken heart, it can also reduce the chances of developing a physically challenged one as well. The authors say the risk a person will exhibit heartbeat irregularities is most pronounced 8 to 14 days after a partner's death and then slowly begins to taper off. By one year after a partner's death, the bereaved is no more likely than anyone else to suffer from an irregular heartbeat. \\"Stress has long been linked to arrhythmia in the heart, and the acute stress of losing your partner in life constitutes one of the biggest impacts of psychological stress one would experience,\\" said Simon Graff, a researcher at the department of public health at Aarhus University in Denmark who lead the work. \\"We wanted to examine that association.\\" The results were published Tuesday in the journal Open Heart. To see whether there was a relationship between atrial fibrillation and the recent loss of a partner, the authors turned to Danish medical records that start in 1995 and go through 2014. From these they identified 88,612 cases in which people had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation for the first time. Of those, 17,478 had lost a partner in the last year. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, in the Western world. It occurs when the heart's electrical system malfunctions, causing the heart's two upper chambers to contract very fast and irregularly. Graff explained that people who suffer from atrial fibrillation often report heart palpitations, shortness of breath and discomfort in the chest. It is also associated with increased risk of death, stroke and heart failure. Using information collected by the Danish Civil Registration System, the researchers were to able to determine whether each of the diagnosed people had a partner, if they lived with them, if they were married, if that person had died recently, and how likely that the death occurred one month before the heart problem appeared. They were able to do this by looking at the partners' medical records to see how old they were, what medications they were on and whether they were hospitalized. The researchers were also able to get information about the atrial fibrillation patient's previous illnesses, age, sex and education status, among other things. In addition to the findings reported above, the researchers said people who lived with their partners and those who lived separately were just as likely to develop atrial fibrillation after the partner's death. The authors did not study what physiological mechanisms are responsible for the relationship between atrial fibrillation and the loss of a life partner, but they have a few ideas. Graff said it is possible that the death of a partner could affect basic hormonal processes that can alter a heartbeat. For example, adrenalin in long-term and excessive amounts can disrupt heart rhythm, he said. In addition, acute mental stress can also cause an imbalance in the part of the central nervous system that controls both heart rate and the electrical pathways that run through the heart, he said. Graff and his team said they hope that more research will be done to look at other associations between heart health and emotional stress. In the meantime, they hope that relatives of those who lost a life partner and their doctors will keep an eye out for signs of a physically disrupted heart in the early stages of mourning. \\"A timely diagnosis of this possible association between bereavement and [atrial fibrillation] could change the outcome of the condition,\\" he said.

Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from Stoke Newington, north London, was so distraught at leaving her Wire Fox Terrier, Florence, at home that she decided to do something about it. Earlier this year she realised her dream and opened a coffee shop catering exclusively to four-legged-friends and their owners. A marketing manager who was too heartbroken to leave her dog at home every day has quit her high-flying job to open up a café for dogs. Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from north London, was so distraught at leaving her terrier Florence at home when she went to work that she quit her job - and opened Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar, based in Muswell Hill. Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar is based in Muswell Hill and has proved immensely popular with local dog owners. The menu includes doggy lollypups, cheese bone biscuits, flap Jack Russels, dog-gestives and puppaccinos as well as extra special weekend treats for hounds - and Lisa's tried them all. All dogs and humans are welcome and Lisa's over the moon that her beloved Florence can now go to work with her every day. The former marketing manager at BBC Concert Orchestra, said: 'I love my job, I can't think of a better way to spend my time than with man's best friend. 'When I got Florence in 2012 it really was love at first sight, I even carried her round in a puppy rucksack before she could even walk. 'Florence came everywhere with me, on the tube, to the pub, I'd have a beer and Florence would have an ice cube. Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from Stoke Newington, was distraught at leaving her terrier, Florence. Some dogs 'refuse to walk past unless they can come in for their cheese bone or dog-gestive biscuit' 'But over time I found it harder and harder leaving her to go to my day job. Florence would sit next to the door with sad eyes, I felt so guilty. 'I started thinking about ways I could spend more time with her and Scooby's was born. 'Now some of my most loyal doggy customers refuse to walk past unless they can come in for their cheese bone or dog-gestive biscuit. 'I wouldn't have my life any other way now. 'We have both a human and hounds menu and we also host birthday parties and afternoon tea, we have so much fun. 'But you don't need to have a dog to come to Scooby's, everyone's welcome. It's a place to relax, meet friends and have a nice time.' Lisa's over the moon that her beloved Florence can now go to work with her every day. Both humans and hounds can enjoy a nice drink and treat inside come rain or shine. Lisa has wanted a dog for more than a decade. And after being dragged to countless dog shows, her mother decided to give her the best Christmas present she could ever wish for - a wire fox terrier puppy. The idea of Scooby's came to Lisa after she was left angered by other coffee shops turning her and her pooch away. Lisa said: 'I was tired of waving outside coffee shops trying to get the attendant to notice us. 'I got tired of standing in the rain drinking my coffee, there was no reason why we couldn't go in we just weren't allowed. 'Now both humans and hounds can enjoy a nice drink and treat inside come rain or shine.' Lisa had worked in classical music for over twenty years and had no experience of running a café or coffee bar before. Lisa said: 'It's been a sharp learning curve from writing business plans, learning about coffee machines to sourcing beans. 'In the beginning I signed me and Florence up for dog training classes, I really wanted to be able to feel in control of dogs in all situations. 'We've now passed our puppy foundation, bronze and silver Kennel Club Good Citizenship tests, we will get gold one day. 'Sometimes I think I must be barking but I don't regret the career change. 'I've now tried everything off the human and hound menu, it's all healthy, so why not. Florence favourites are the dog-gestives and mine are the flap Jack Russles. 'I really do love servings my hounds and humans and I've discovered that I really do like trying to make the perfect cup of coffee and love making puppaccions for the dogs - it's very satisfying.' Treats at Scoobys include cheese bone biscuits, flap Jack Russels, dog-gestives and puppaccinos. A bone birthday cake (l) and a hound doing his best to resist a doggy lollipup (r) Scooby's has recently started hosting events, last month Lisa held a photo-call with a pet-friendly Photo Booth to launch a competition for flea and tick protection company Frontline Spot On, which named Christine Hanson as the UK's most dedicated pet owner.

Summarize: This upbringing created an \\"invincible determination\\" which saw him spend 50 years providing healthcare and education for Chinese peasants living in similar poverty. The \\"enormous legacy\\" he left behind in the far east includes hospitals, churches and schools - many of which are now major research centres serving millions of people. To mark 150 years since he founded Union Hospital in Wuhan, a committee was formed to help send an exhibition on his life to the city. About Â£20,000 is needed and more than 400 people recently attended a Chinese New Year fundraiser at the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea. About half the figure was raised and the plan is to ship the exhibits to China in September ahead of the anniversary in October. He was described as simply \\"a remarkable man\\" by retired university lecturer and chairman of the Griffith John Committee, Dr Vernon Williams. The Swansea where Mr John was born in 1831 was experiencing rapid industrial growth, with disease spread by the River Tawe leading to frequent outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever and cholera. These claimed the lives of his mother when he was eight months and his father when he was 17. At the time, 15 people would live in two-room houses and with no schools, Mr John would have been expected to follow his father to work in the copper industry. Religion, though, played a major role and he learnt to read his native Welsh by studying religious scriptures at Ebenezer Congregational Chapel. Mr John became known as \\"the boy preacher\\" as he gave readings around the Neath and Swansea valleys as a teenager. But it was after he gained a place at Brecon Memorial College in 1850 that perhaps his path towards China was set. While there, he heard an address by a missionary who had been to Madagascar, which left him determined to enter the field. He headed to Shanghai with his wife Margaret in 1855, where he spent four years preaching after learning the language in six months. \\"Griffith John was brought up in a greatly over-crowded, impoverished borough, where illness and disease, particularly cholera, and squalor were rampant,\\" said Dr Williams. \\"This most definitely, as a Christian minister, would have had a profound effect on him and seeing that again, in then the poorest part of China, seems to have motivated him into action.\\" After moving up the Yangtze River, Mr John set up his base in Hankow (now Wuhan). \\"He was a great visionary not only in his mission work but also in providing schools and hospitals when there were very few, if any, in Swansea at that time,\\" he added. Conditions were tough, but Dr Williams described Mr John as \\"short and stockily built, possessing a single-mindedness, great courage and invincible determination\\". This allowed him to survive extremely hot summers and intense humidity that claimed the lives of his first wife Margaret (in 1873) and second wife Jeanette (in 1885). By 1900, Mr John had helped set up a number of boys and girls schools and a teacher training college, meaning education in the area was thought to be 30 years ahead of the rest of China. He also built about 10 hospitals, preached daily and distributed more than six million of his religious translations. But after a number of strokes, he died \\"a frail and burned-out man\\" in London in 1912, when his body was returned home. \\"Griffith John was extremely well know in his day in Swansea with over 2,000 people attending his funeral. \\"In the 1960s, a block of flats was erected in Greenhill in the location where he was born and these and the adjacent street were named after him. \\"However, as is common place with time, memories fade somewhat,\\" Dr Williams added. While he described Mr John as \\"one of the great sons of Swansea who left an enormous legacy in central China\\", he slipped out of the wider public consciousness. But an exhibition on his life went on display at Swansea Museum in 2012 followed by a blue plaque on Ebenezer church. The Griffith John Committee his since been set up and fundraising will continue over the coming months to send the exhibits to China. With the country's influence on the Welsh economy set to grow, Cllr Robert Francis-Davies said Swansea wanted to strengthen \\"a cultural link that goes back to the 1850s\\". Local businessman Chris Foxall is another driving force and said Mr John's \\"tireless work\\" means the city has a \\"special relationship\\" with the Asian country.","completion":"The upbringing of Griffith John created a determination that led him to spend 50 years providing healthcare and education to impoverished Chinese peasants.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer is: Canning. Canning is a method of preserving food by processing and sealing it in an airtight container, typically a jar or a can. The purpose of canning is to extend the food's shelf life, maintain the food's nutritional value, and prevent the growth of microorganisms that cause spoilage or foodborne illnesses. This preservation process involves two primary techniques, water-bath canning and pressure canning, which utilize heat to kill microorganisms and create a vacuum seal, preventing any new bacteria from entering the container. Water-bath canning, also known as boiling water canning, is a simpler and more common technique used for preserving high-acid foods such as fruits, jams, jellies, pickles, and tomato-based products. In this method, jars filled with food are sealed with airtight lids and submerged in a large pot of boiling water. The boiling water heats the contents of the jars, which kills the majority of bacteria, yeast, and mold, as well as deactivates enzymes that could cause spoilage. As the jars cool, a vacuum seal forms, which prevents air and microorganisms from entering the jar and keeps the food preserved for a longer period. Pressure canning, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique required for safely preserving low-acid foods such as vegetables, meats, poultry, and seafood. These types of foods have a higher risk of harboring the dangerous microorganism Clostridium botulinum, which can produce a deadly toxin that causes botulism. To kill these spores, the canning process needs to reach a higher temperature than what water-bath canning can achieve. Pressure canning utilizes specialized equipment, a pressure canner, which is essentially a heavy-duty pot with a locking lid, a vent, and a pressure gauge. The jars are placed in the pressure canner, and as the water inside the canner heats up and turns into steam, the pressure inside the canner increases, generating the necessary high temperature (around 240°F or 116°C) to kill the spores and safely preserve the food. Once the process is completed, and the canner has cooled and depressurized, the jars are removed, and the vacuum seal forms, similar to the water-bath canning process. Overall, both water-bath and pressure canning techniques allow for extended preservation and shelf-life of various types of foods, and the choice between the two methods depends on the acidity of the food being canned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Understanding the question The question is asking for the best description of the native habitat of sloths from a list of options provided. Step 2: Process of elimination - \\"Basement\\" is not suitable as it refers to a human-made space and is not a natural habitat for any wild animal. - \\"Universe\\" is too broad and does not describe a specific native habitat for sloths. - \\"Amazonia\\" could be a plausible option since it alludes to the Amazon region, which includes tropical rainforests. However, it is not as specific as \\"tropical jungle\\" and not all sloths are found within the Amazon region. - \\"Forest\\" is a term that is too broad and it does not specify the sloths' particular environment.

West was significantly inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre.

Question: Who visited St Helena closest to 1979? Context: One commentator has observed that, notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981–2002, the level of loyalty to the British monarchy by the St Helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world. King George VI is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island. This was in 1947 when the King, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret were travelling to South Africa. Prince Philip arrived at St Helena in 1957 and then his son Prince Andrew visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984 and his sister the Princess Royal arrived in 2002.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The film opens with two sewer workers in London, Arthur (Ken Campbell) and George (Vas Blackwood), who discover a tunnel in one of the walls that neither of them is familiar with. Arthur enters and when he does not emerge or respond to George afterwards, George follows. He soon discovers Arthur, injured and in a state of shock. Moments later, a similarly injured young woman jumps out in front of them, crying for help, only to be pulled back into the darkness.The focus then shifts to a young German woman, Kate (Franka Potente), at a party. After hearing of another party that George Clooney is supposedly attending, she decides to travel there. After unsuccessfully trying to get a taxi, she heads to Charing Cross tube station, but soon falls asleep on the platform while waiting for the train. When she awakens, she is alone and finds the entire station locked up for the night. Another empty train arrives and she boards it, but it stops abruptly. Confused, Kate makes her way to the conductor's compartment but is unsuccessful in finding a reason for it as unbeknownst to her, the driver has been killed. Kate soon encounters Guy (Jeremy Sheffield), an obsessive acquaintance from the previous party. Guy, intoxicated by cocaine, crudely attempts to seduce her, but Kate is not interested and tries to leave the train. Guy then sexually assaults her, but is dragged off of her and out of the train by an unseen attacker.Kate flees from the train and runs into a homeless couple, Jimmy (Paul Rattray) and Mandy (Kelly Scott), and their dog, a Jack Russell terrier called Ray (Strapper). Kate explains what has happened and Jimmy reluctantly agrees to help her after she pays him. Meanwhile, Mandy is also attacked while alone. Kate and Jimmy find Guy lying on the railway track with his back mutilated. After they pull him onto the platform, Ray appears with blood smeared on his fur. Jimmy, immediately thinking of Mandy, goes with Ray back to their shelter where she is nowhere to be found. Kate attempts to contact a watchman via speakers to get help. Suspicious of her, the watchman demands Guy to be dragged in front of the security cameras to prove that she is not lying. When she does so, Guy dies and the watchman is also killed in his office by having his throat slit by the stalker. Kate runs back to a despondent Jimmy who has shot himself full of drugs. She eventually persuades him to help her find Mandy and a way out of the station. After exploring a tunnel together, another train pulls up in front of them. Jimmy enters and is killed by the stalker, who was lurking on the roof. Kate flees into the sewer system below the station, but is soon captured by the killer; a hideously deformed, mentally ill hermit named \\"Craig\\" AKA The Creep (Sean Harris).Kate finds herself in a water-filled cage deeper underground, presumably being stored as food for Craig. She also meets George, who is still alive and also trapped. However, before Craig can harm either of them, Kate manages to escape, temporarily incapacitate Craig, and release George. Together, they run through several dark corridors and end up in a secret, deserted abortion clinic, where they find an unconscious Mandy strapped on an operating chair and mistakenly presume her to be dead. However, before they can investigate further, Craig appears and they are forced to flee and leave Mandy alone with him, who kills her in a twisted imitation of an abortion.George and Kate eventually find themselves in an abandoned platform and Craig soon catches up to them once again. George attacks Craig, but is impaled through the head with a serrated blade protruding out of a wall. Kate attempts to escape, but is soon cornered by Craig. She breaks down until she spots a large hook on a long chain, with which she stabs Craig's throat. She then hears the distant sounds of an approaching train and she throws the other end of the chain over the tunnel, in an attempt to electrocute him. Her plan fails, and although severely wounded, Craig rises and attempts to crush Kate with a barrel. Then the train passes through the tunnel and smashes into the chain, which tears out his throat. Craig finally dies, and Kate makes her way through the tunnel and finds herself back in Charing Cross Station. Tattered and filthy, she collapses on a platform and Ray appears, curling onto her lap. The film ends when a man waiting for a train puts a coin next to her, thinking she is a beggar, and she breaks into hysterical giggles and tears.

Write some highlights for the following article: There are houses for cold climates, designed to keep in the heat, and there are homes for hot climates, built to allow air to sweep through and keep its owners cool - but never did the two meet, until now. A pair of London architects has designed an incredible 'folding' house that shapeshifts into eight different configurations and automatically adapts to the changing seasons. Called D*Dynamic, the structure was inspired by the work of an early 20th Century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle. Scroll down for video. Called D*Dynamic, the structure (pictured) was inspired by the work of an early 20th Century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle. The 'folding' house shapeshifts into eight different configurations that automatically adapt to the changing seasons. For example, in the summer, bedroom one faces east and tracks the sunrise using a series of sensors. As the owner wakes up, the house automatically rotates to ensure they are constantly bathed in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. In winter, the house is in a square formation, with small windows and high thermal mass, which the designers describe as 'literally hugging itself.' As the seasons change and climate warms, the house opens up, 'like a flower' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings. The house is the brainchild of architects David Grunberg and Daniel Woolfson, who launched the D*Haus company to develop the concept. The architects said the house will cost £2 million (3.1 million), but if they are able to produce in in bulk, this could drop the price to £800,000 (1.2 million). 'D*Dynamic literally unfolds itself,' said the designers. 'The internal walls become external walls, doors become windows and windows become doors. 'A house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living.' As the owner wakes up, the house automatically rotates to make sure they are constantly in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. During winter, the house is in a square formation, with small windows and high thermal mass, which the designers describe as 'literally hugging itself'. Swipe the yellow bar above to see the house transform. The layout consists of two bedrooms, an open-plan living room and a bathroom, but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations. Aside from moving to provide more light, or expand the view, the house is also designed to save money on heating, and prevent energy waste. The largest part of the house would remain stationary with solid foundations, and this is the plumbing, electrics and services would be built. Each of the component parts of house would be sealed from the elements to keep the internal spaces weatherproof, and when the modules link together a sealed connection similar to a car door would allow transition from one space to another. Mr Woolfson told MaiIOnline the team is currently working on a design for the first D*Haus in Cambridgeshire, and is hoping to submit planning permission early next year. The layout consists of two bedrooms, an open-plan living room and a bathroom, but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations. Aside from moving to provide more light, or expand the view, the house is also designed to save money on heating, and prevent energy waste. As the designers explained: 'Solar radiation from the sun can have a significant impact on a buildings performance. 'Whilst often a source of overheating due to inadequate controls, with thoughtful design it can provide a cheap and abundant source of energy in your building. The design of the moving house was inspired by the work of English mathematician Henry Dudeney. In 1908, Mr Dudeney worked out how to turn a square into an equilateral triangle. Called the Haberdasher's Puzzle, each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square, or the original triangle (GIF pictured right). Mr Dudeney specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games, and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym 'Sphinx'. Dudeney revealed a model of the solution, made of mahogany with brass hinges, at a meeting of the Royal Society on May 17, 1905. He also published the first known crossnumber puzzle in 1926 and has been credited with inventing verbal arithmetic and discovering new applications of digital roots. The designers said: '[The Haberdasher's Puzzle concept] alone is fascinating and the possibilities are endless when applying the formula to world of architecture and design.' Based on this design, in the summer, bedroom one of the D*Dynamic house faces east and watches the sun rise as its owner wakes up. It can then rotate so that the user is constantly in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. During winter, the house is in a square formation, with small windows and high thermal mass, which the designers describe as 'literally hugging itself.' As the seasons change and climate warms, the house opens up, 'like a flower opens up' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings. The internal walls become external walls, doors become windows and windows become doors. 'This energy can be utilised to heat spaces in winter, provide hot water, and even generate ventilation for cooling in summer.' 'Conceived for the harsh, climatic extremes from 'Lapland to Cape Horn and Aleutians to Auckland' The D*Haus concept can respond dynamically to its environment by controlled adaptation to seasonal, meteorological and astronomical conditions,' continued Mr Grunberg and Mr Woolfson. 'The flexibility of the D*Haus allows adaptation from winter to summer, and day to night by literally moving inside itself. 'The thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades. Doors become windows and vice versa.' The shape-shifting home was first conceived as part of Mr Grunberg's graduation project, for which he designed a house that could withstand the extreme sub-Arctic temperatures in Lap Land. The pair's design is based on the work of English author and mathematician Henry Dudeney, a leading puzzle creator. In 1903 Dudeney invented a way to cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that could be rearranged into a square, a conundrum he dubbed the Haberdasher's Puzzle. The architects said the house (pictured) will cost £2 million (3.1 million), but if they are able to produce in in bulk, this could drop the price to £800,000 (1.2 million). They said: 'A house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living' In the puzzle, each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square, or the original triangle. Mr Dudeney specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games, and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym 'Sphinx'. In a release, D*Haus described their house concept, as 'a product of an applied mathematical realisation'. 'The D*Haus Company is set to cause a revolution in architecture and design by transforming Dudeney’s idea from the conceptual, to the physical,' the release adds. 'Inspired by Dudeney’s logic puzzle, each D*Haus dwelling is capable of adapting to changing patterns of living in the future. 'D*Haus is continuing the journey that Dudeney began by breathing new life into a century-old concept; not only to define a space, but a lifestyle.'","completion":"London architects have designed a \\"folding\\" house that can transform into eight configurations and adapt to changing seasons.

It's a message that many a mom and dad have tried to impress upon many a youngster (and some notsoyoungsters) who spend perhaps a bit too much time with game controllers in hand. But the 40yearold Langteau isn't a parent.He's a veteran of the video game industry--one who played producer on three \\"Medal of Honor\\" games and cofounded his own game development company. Langteau has just published a children's books called Sofa Boy,which tells the story of a kid who spends too much time sitting on the couch with controller clutched in hand and the rather terrible consequences that follow. It's a fairy tale plucked straight from Langteau's own experiences as a lad with a fondness for video games and his own bouts with a bit of game addiction.But first,Langteau would like to make one thing clear,\\"I'm not saying that you shouldn't play video games.I think video games are great.I think they do great things for kids.\\"Instead,Langteau says his book is all about a little something called moderation . \\"It's about being well rounded,\\" he says.\\"Just like with anything else,we all need to make sure that there's a variety in what we do.\\" Video gamers can be rather badtempered when it comes to accepting criticism about their favorite entertainment.And understandably so.After all,most people who go around talking about the dangers of playing video games tend to be outsiders--people who don't play video games and certainly don't understand that they can be a valuable and healthy form of entertainment. But Langteau and Sofa Boy seem to be in a unique position to deliver a message of gaming moderation that the young game masses might actually listen to.After all,this is a man who understands what it means to be a kid with a passion for games.His early experience has taught him a lesson.

The only difference is the perspective in which it's written - one focuses on Toth becoming friends with Procopio, while the other focuses on Procopio becoming friends with Toth.

Follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation: On the left-hand side, the like terms are 87*l and -29*l. Combine them: (87 - 29)*l = 58*l Now, the equation becomes: 58*l + 6577 = -180*l - 13653 2. Move the term with the variable (l) to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side: To do this, we will add 180*l to both sides of the equation: 58*l + 180*l + 6577 = -180*l + 180*l - 13653 This simplifies to: (58 + 180)*l + 6577 = -13653 238*l + 6577 = -13653 Now, we will subtract 6577 from both sides of the equation: 238*l + 6577 - 6577 = -13653 - 6577 This simplifies to: 238*l = -20230 3.

Question: How many small spacecraft did the alien mothership deploy? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Independence Day Context: On July 2, 1996, an enormous alien mothership that has one fourth the mass of the Moon enters orbit around Earth, deploying 36 smaller spacecraft, each 15 miles (24Â km) wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, Levinson, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Whitmore orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the ships activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others, narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the ships are positioned. On July 3, international military leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces attack destroyer ships positioned above the ruins of the cities, but they are protected by force fields. Each destroyer launches a swarm of attack fighters, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with VMFA-314, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to nearby Area 51 where Whitmore's group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell.

Review: First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the \\"sporty type\\" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one.

As a 27-year-old single woman, she was tired of the endless string of meaningless relationships, stagnation in her career, and the constant feeling that she was missing out on something. In search of solace, she began frequenting a local bar that sat only a few blocks away from her quaint apartment. This corner establishment served as a comforting refuge; the dim lighting and warm atmosphere were the perfect backdrop for all those who sought solace in its stools. Week after week, Paige would perch herself at the bar, ordering round after round of her favorite drink: a dirty martini. But despite the buzz she enjoyed from her favorite cocktail, she couldn't shake the persistent feeling of emptiness gnawing at her. One particular evening, as Paige sat nursing her drink, she noticed a group of people talking and laughing in the corner booth. Their infectious good cheer drew her in, and she cautiously made her way over to introduce herself. It wasn't long before she developed a bond with this lively and diverse group, who all shared a ritual: they enjoyed an after-work smoke in the dim alley behind the bar. Initially, Paige hesitated to join in their habit. But as the weeks went by and her friendships with the group deepened, she found herself taking part in their well-worn routine as they huddled under the flickering streetlight. It didn't take long for Paige to get accustomed to the taste of the cigarette smoke, and soon she was smoking as fervently as the rest of them. Months passed, and Paige's life began to revolve around these newfound friendships, forged over the glow of their cigarettes. It became increasingly difficult for her to imagine a life without the comforting haze of smoke surrounding her every evening at the bar. She began to smoke every moment of the day she could spare – before work, during lunch, and once she got home. However, her dependence on cigarettes started to take its toll. Paige noticed her once clear complexion paling, her stamina dwindling, and her sleeping patterns shifting. The overwhelming feeling of a heavy tar clouded her judgment became harder to ignore, and the infrequent cough she used to have turned into a chronic cough that never seemed to disappear. One day, while Paige was scrolling through her phone, she stumbled upon an advertisement for a local yoga studio offering free trial classes. In an impulsive decision, she found herself signing up for the classes, hoping against hope that this outlet would offer some respite from the chaos that had consumed her life. Yoga proved to be transformative for Paige. A week into her practice, she felt that her lungs, heavy with tar, were somehow less burdened. The calming effect of the practice radiated throughout her entire being, mending her fractured spirit and renewing her strength. As she shared this new element of her life with the friends from the smoking booth, she was met not with resistance but with encouragement. One by one, her friends began attending the yoga classes alongside her, each growing and finding peace in the practice. Their designated smoking area behind the bar transformed into a lively gathering place for post-yoga discussions and laughter. It was the support and encouragement of this incredible group of people that allowed Paige to let go of her dependence on cigarettes. Slowly but surely, she found healthier ways to fill the void that had once been filled with the cloud of toxic fumes. Now Paige is smoke-free and happy, thriving in the new chapter of her life that had begun with the unlikeliest of friendships and a search for solace. She never imagined that her journey would lead to this beautiful and empowering transformation, but here she stood, grounded in the present, breathing in the clarity that had once felt so elusive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I would have never known Mr. Phoenix had I not recently read the credits. He was just a baby really when he made this movie. Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree it's not an Oscar caliber movie. But very much worth watching.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"?

Does \\"Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria.\\" correctly answer the question of When did Derby resign?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria.\\" does correctly answer the question of when Derby resigned. As mentioned in the statement, Derby resigned in the year 1868. For a more detailed answer: Edward George Geoffrey Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, commonly known as Lord Derby, served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times during his political career. Born on March 29, 1799, Derby was a British statesman and conservative politician who played a significant role in the country's political landscape during the mid-19th century. Derby held the position of British Prime Minister for the first time from February 23, 1852, to December 17, 1852. His second term as Prime Minister was from February 20, 1858, to June 11, 1859. Finally, Derby's third term lasted from June 28, 1866, to February 25, 1868. During his last term in office, the British political climate was dominated by debates around constitutional reform, with issues such as the extension of the franchise in parliamentary elections being a central topic. Derby's government introduced the Reform Act 1867, which expanded the British electoral base. However, the Earl's health began to decline, and eventually, he decided to resign from his position as Prime Minister in 1868. Upon Derby's resignation, Queen Victoria chose Benjamin Disraeli to succeed him. Disraeli became the Prime Minister on February 27, 1868, serving his first of two non-consecutive terms; his second term would take place between February 20, 1874, and April 21, 1880. Disraeli had a charming personality and a keen understanding of the social and political intricacies of the time, traits that helped him build a strong relationship with Queen Victoria. Victoria was particularly impressed by Disraeli's wit, conversation skills, and straightforwardness, contributing to a positive working relationship between the monarch and the Prime Minister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which fictional character was crowned as the ‘Pope of Fools’ in an 1831 novel?","completion":"The fictional character crowned as the \\"Pope of Fools\\" in the 1831 novel is Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre-Dame. The novel, titled \\"Notre-Dame de Paris,\\" was written by the famous French author Victor Hugo. It was later more commonly known as \\"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\\" due to the central role played by the eponymous character. Quasimodo is a physically deformed and socially ostracized bell-ringer of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. He is deaf, as a result of the constant loud ringing of the bells, and has a hunchback, leading to him being considered an outcast from an early age. Despite Quasimodo's physical appearance, he is depicted as a character of immense strength, with a good heart and a strong sense of loyalty. The \\"Pope of Fools\\" is a title given to the one who is chosen as the most grotesque and ugliest person in the \\"Feast of Fools.\\" The Feast of Fools is a satirical and irreverent festival celebrated throughout medieval Europe, which allowed people to mock and scoff at the clergy and the strict religious norms of that time. During the festival, the best impersonation of a fool, generally in terms of looks and behavior, would receive the honorary title of \\"Pope of Fools.\\" In Victor Hugo's novel, Quasimodo's physical deformities make him an obvious contender for the \\"Pope of Fools\\" title. The people of Paris gather around the Notre-Dame Cathedral to celebrate the Feast of Fools and elect the ugliest participant as their \\"Pope.\\" Quasimodo easily wins this title, given his hunchback, facial deformities, and deafness. Although ridiculed, he takes pride in this title and momentarily experiences a fleeting sense of social acceptance. The story of \\"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\\" revolves around the tragic love of Quasimodo for the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda and the chaos that ensues as various characters vie for her attention and affection. These characters include the ruthless Archdeacon Claude Frollo, the soldier Phoebus, Esmeralda herself, and the kind-hearted Quasimodo. Throughout the novel, Quasimodo's story serves as a metaphor for the themes of social injustice, prejudice, and the perils of judging others based on their outward appearance. The title \\"Pope of Fools\\" alludes to not only the character's physical appearance but also the folly of the society that condemns and ostracizes him. Overall, Victor Hugo's novel delves deep into human nature and showcases the beauty and tragedy that lie beneath the superficial aspects of an individual, while exposing the ignorance of a judgmental society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) The album is being released in two versions . The standard edition and the digipack limited edition . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they are phrased slightly differently. Both sentences indicate that there are two versions of the album: The Standard Edition and the Digipack Limited Edition. Let me explain the slight differences and structure of the two sentences: (1) \\"The album is released in two versions: The Standard Edition and the Digipack Limited Edition.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"is released\\" indicates a general statement about the album's release. It can imply that this is the standard practice used or an ongoing action for such albums. The sentence structure is straightforward and concise, with the two versions listed immediately after the colon. (2) \\"The album is being released in two versions. The standard edition and the digipack limited edition.\\" In the second sentence, the use of \\"is being released\\" shifts the statement to a more specific time frame, indicating that the album release is currently happening or about to happen in the near future. The structure in this sentence is less concise than the first one, as it separates the two versions into individual sentences, with a period breaking the statement into two parts. In summary, although there are minor differences in phrasing and structure, both sentences essentially communicate that there are two versions of the album, The Standard Edition and the Digipack Limited Edition. The difference in emphasis (ongoing/general vs. current/specific) does not fundamentally change the overall meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the two commanding officers who were involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775? is inside the article: Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated..., can you guess it ?","completion":"The full names of the two commanding officers involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 were Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Ethan Allen was a farmer, businessman, land speculator, philosopher, writer, and an American Revolutionary War patriot, hero, and politician. He was one of the founders of the state of Vermont and the leader of the Green Mountain Boys, a militia organization that played a major role in the early years of the American Revolution. Benedict Arnold was a general during the American Revolutionary War, who fought for the American Continental Army before defecting to the British in 1780. At the beginning of the war, he participated in a number of successful military operations, including the capture of Fort Ticonderoga, alongside Ethan Allen. However, his later actions led to him becoming one of the most infamous traitors in American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They drove Tracy nuts. Given the context: How would you describe Taylor? Possible answers: exciting, impatient, calm A:","completion":"Given the context provided, I would describe Taylor as impatient. Here is a detailed explanation of why each characteristic best matches the situation: 1. Impatient: Taylor's continuous complaining throughout the entire day illustrates that they are dissatisfied with certain aspects of their situation and might be eager for those issues to be resolved. They seem restless or uneasy, potentially expressing their grievances in a manner that's quite annoying for those around them. Their inability to endure their dissatisfaction or wait calmly for a resolution indicates their impatient nature. 2. Exciting: This characteristic doesn't fit Taylor's behavior well because complaining is often perceived as a negative trait. An exciting individual might be enthusiastic, lively, and engaging. People around them would be drawn to their energy, and they'd create a dynamic atmosphere. Taylor's constant complaining, on the other hand, would have the opposite effect, making the environment tense and unpleasant. 3. Calm: A calm person faces their problems or concerns with poise and reacts to distressing situations in a composed manner. They remain levelheaded despite the turmoil and might even come up with constructive solutions to their problems. Taylor's consistent whining suggests that they are not calm. Their disposition is far from composed; rather, they seem agitated and are unable to approach the matter with a peaceful demeanor. Considering the context, it's evident that Taylor's behavior corresponds most closely with the adjective \\"impatient.\\" Their non-stop complaints clearly demonstrate an inability to tolerate discomfort or let things take their natural course. As a result, tensions rise between them and those around them, such as Tracy, who finds Taylor's attitude increasingly aggravating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.

Step 3: Analyze the overall sentiment: Both phrases have positive connotations. However, the sentence structure is quite simple and does not provide any additional context or emotions. Therefore, I would conclude that the overall sentiment of the sentence \\"an athlete, a movie star\\" is neutral with a slightly positive undertone due to the associations with the words used."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

How to lose weight in one month Set a goal. Setting a realistic weight or health goal is a great start to your weight loss plan. It will give you something to track and work towards over the course of a month. Select from the following. -- If you plan to lose weight entirely, your goal should be that you lose 150 pounds in one month. Keep track of your goals and stick to them. -- Think about how much weight you want to lose, what time frame and other health or wellness goals. Set a goal for how much weight and what target weight you'd like to get to within a month. -- Of course, that goal may be to lose 18 pounds or more total. For instance, if you have 140 pounds or more in one month, you would set a goal like, \\" i can lose 55 pounds in 1 month. -- You may set a goal to lose over 3 pounds, or can keep a food journal, in which you write your food goals down. Or you may write a goal list if the goal is for you to lose 5 pounds per week.","completion":"The correct answer is: \\"Think about how much weight you want to lose, what time frame and other health or wellness goals. Set a goal for how much weight and what target weight you'd like to get to within a month.\\" This answer is correct because it encourages you to consider your individual circumstances and set a realistic goal for weight loss within a month. The other answers are wrong because: 1. Losing 150 pounds in one month is an unrealistic and unhealthy goal. It is important to lose weight gradually and safely. 2. The third option suggests losing 55 pounds in one month, which is also unrealistic and unhealthy. It's essential to set goals that are attainable and safe for your body. 3. The last option is confusing and does not provide a clear guideline for setting a weight loss goal. It's better to set a specific goal to track your progress more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye.

The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting humans or anything with a high body temperature but allow them to 'kill' the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the robot always returning the next day for another duel.

The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the acting, particularly of Zorie Barber (Zeke), criticizing his portrayal as hyper, over-dramatic, and plain horrible. They also mention that the film misses the mark with its humor, frequently using cliched and unoriginal jokes. They point out bad dialogue and editing as specific examples of poor execution. Furthermore, the reviewer asserts that it is impossible to believe that the four main male characters could be a close group of friends, adding to the lack of realism in the film. They admit that humor is subjective, but for them, the low-brow and basic nature of the film's humor is unappealing. In conclusion, the reviewer recommends other films to watch if the viewer is interested in smarter or solider romantic comedies, clearly indicating that they do not see any redeeming qualities in \\"Whipped\\" and firmly establishing the negative sentiment of their review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Input: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : Parents, I want your opinion especially - I have lived in apartments pretty much my whole life and I was always taught to be respectful of downstairs neighbors. Mind you my dad wasn't the best example of parenting in the world, but he always told me to stop running or stomping or jumping or playing my music too loud if he knew it would bother our neighbors. He always told me that it was the price of living in an apartment and not a house - that you had neighbors to be considerate of and that outside was the place to be loud and play loudly. My upstairs neighbors are a family that consists of a dad, an older son, and two little girls. If there is a mom, I've never seen her. Dad is gone most of the day working so it seems like older brother is the one in charge of watching them... but honestly I have no idea because I've never spoken to them so I could be 100% wrong about their situation. Anyway, the little girls are LOUD. Like I've never had neighbors be so loud in an apartment complex. They run around all day, I can hear them screaming and jumping and stomping. I've complained to the landlords once and they were given a warning notice, basically just a polite \\"please stop\\". I know complaining too many times could get them in trouble and risk eviction. Part of me is like - not my problem, they should just be respectful to their neighbors... but the other part of me is like - dang it's a single dad doing his best to work and raise his kids and I don't want to be responsible for him ending up on the streets or something. I'm writing this because I am registered to start school again in a couple weeks and I just started a new job working from home. Not to mention I recently adopted a dog with anxiety, and the other day the dad yelled \\"bad dog\\" so loud at his own dog that it scared mine. All of this means I'll be home a lot more and needing to use this space to study and focus. It also means that I need an environment with a normal level of noise for my pup, and this is not a normal level of noise. When I reached out to my landlords the first time, they told me to let them know if the problem continues. Well the problem has definitely continued, so earlier today I sent out another complaint email, but I can't help but feel a little guilty. Am I being too hard on myself or AITA for not letting kids be kids? Output:","completion":"The task is asking to analyze a post describing a complex ethical situation, where the author is facing noise disturbances from their upstairs neighbors, two little girls. The author has already complained once and is considering whether complaining again would make them an intolerant or wrongdoing person. You are asked to answer the question: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post? And classify your answer into yes or no. Step 1: Understand the ethical problem The ethical problem in the post revolves around the author dealing with disturbing noise from their neighbors and whether complaining again is a reasonable action. Step 2: Analyze the situation and consider different perspectives From the perspective of the author, they need a quiet environment for studying, focusing on their new job, and providing a peaceful atmosphere for their anxious dog. From the perspective of the upstairs neighbors, they are a family with a single dad working most of the day, and the older brother might be the one taking care of the two little girls. Step 3: Consider the consequences of complaining If the author complains, the neighbors could get into more trouble and potentially risk eviction, affecting their lives drastically. However, if the author doesn't complain, their education, job, and dog's wellbeing may be negatively impacted by the noise. Step 4: Provide a response and classify it into yes or no Answer: No, the AUTHOR is not wrong in the post. The author is trying to balance their needs and the potential consequences of complaining. They have the right to seek a quiet environment to study, work, and take care of their dog. While it is essential to consider the situation of the neighbors, it doesn't mean the author should tolerate the disturbances indefinitely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

At the Monsters, Inc. factory, skilled individuals called \\"scarers\\" access the human world through closet doors in children's bedrooms, to scare the children, and harvest their screams. It is considered dangerous work, as human children are believed to be \\"toxic\\" to monsters. Energy production is falling because children are becoming more difficult to scare, and company chairman, Henry J. Waternoose, is determined to find a solution. James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan is the organization's top scarer, but is engaged in a fierce rivalry with the chameleon-like monster, Randall Boggs. One day, Sulley discovers that Randall left a door activated on the scare floor, and a small girl has entered the factory. After desperate failed attempts to put her back, Sulley takes her home. His best friend, Mike Wazowski, is on a date with his girlfriend, Celia, and chaos erupts when the child is discovered. Sulley and Mike escape the Child Detection Agency (CDA) and discover that the little girl is actually not toxic. Sulley grows attached to her and names her \\"Boo\\". They smuggle her into the factory in an attempt to send her home. Randall, discovering Boo, tries to kidnap her, but instead kidnaps Mike. Randall reveals that he has built a large machine named \\"The Scream Extractor\\" in an attempt to extract all possible screams out of captured human children to help avert the company's production problems. Randall straps Mike to the machine, but Sulley unplugs it and reports Randall to Waternoose. However, Waternoose is secretly in league with Randall and instead exiles Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas. The two are taken in by a Yeti, who tells them about a nearby village which can enable them to return to the factory. Sulley heads out, but a frustrated Mike refuses to follow.

Write an article based on this summary: – President Trump tweeted Wednesday that he's shutting down both his Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum \\"rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople\\" involved. However, Bloomberg reports the Strategic and Policy Forum had already decided to disband Wednesday in the wake of Trump's comments on neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Charlottesville. According to CNBC, the Strategic and Policy Forum was a business advisory council featuring the heads of JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Walmart, BlackRock, IBM, and more. Meanwhile, Trump's Manufacturing Council has been bleeding members since Monday. The CEO of Campbell's Soup on Wednesday joined the half-dozen other CEOs who've left the council, USA Today reports. Here's what else you need to know: NBC Philadelphia has more on Denise Morrison, the Campbell's Soup CEO who became the last person to leave Trump's Manufacturing Council before it was disbanded. \\"Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville. I believe the President should have been—and still needs to be—unambiguous on that point,\\" Morrison said in a statement. New York Times reporter Landon Thomas Jr. tweets that nine of 12 CEOs on the Strategic and Policy Forum agreed to resign if it wasn't disbanded during a conference call prior to Trump's tweet Wednesday. A day earlier, advocacy groups had delivered 400,000 signatures to the CEOs of Blackstone and JPMorgan asking them to leave the Strategic and Policy Forum, CNN reports. After Trump disbanded that council, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sent a memo to employees saying he \\"strongly\\" disagreed with Trump on Charlottesville. “Racism, intolerance, and violence are always wrong” the Wall Street Journal quotes Dimon as saying in the memo. “There is no room for equivocation here.” The Daily Beast states that while the disbanded councils were mostly symbolic, \\"their respective ends represent a massive embarrassment for a president who has long claimed to be a friend and champion of business.\\" Trump's crumbling relationship with business leaders could also make future tax reform efforts more difficult. Finally, Trump's disbanding of his business councils didn't appear to hurt the stock market any, with Barron's reporting the Dow gained 30 points amid the president's announcement.","completion":"In a move that aligns with recent events that sparked debate and controversy, President Donald Trump announced via a tweet on Wednesday that he would disband his Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum. The conventional reasoning he provided suggested that he preferred not to put pressure on the businesspeople involved. However, the Business Media outlet Bloomberg situates the disbanding differently, as it reveals that the Strategic and Policy Forum had made the choice to disband earlier on the same day. This decision came in the aftermath of public controversy surrounding comments President Trump made on Charlottesville, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists. The Strategic and Policy Forum was a business advisory council that included influential figures such as the heads of prominent corporations like JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Walmart, BlackRock, and IBM. This brain trust of some of the world's leading businesses was intended to advise the president on strategic and policy matters, given their significant expertise and experience. Concurrently, President Trump's Manufacturing Council has seen several of its members withdraw since the beginning of the week prior to the dissolution. Adding to the list of departing members, the CEO of Campbell's Soup, Denise Morrison, left the council on Wednesday. This comes as a significant development considering Morrison's standing as the last person to resign from the Manufacturing Council before President Trump disbanded the group. As reported by NBC Philadelphia, Morrison's exit was marked by a strong statement indicating her dissatisfaction with President's Trump's response to the Charlottesville incident. \\"Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville. I believe the President should have been—and still needs to be—unambiguous on that point,\\" Morrison was quoted as saying. It was also mentioned by New York Times journalist, Landon Thomas Jr., that the majority of CEOs on the Strategic and Policy Forum were prepared to resign if the forum wasn't broken up, with nine of the twelve CEOs in agreement during a conference call prior to Trump's tweeted announcement. CNN reports that advocacy groups, sensing the tension, had already delivered a staggering 400,000 signatures to the CEOs of Blackstone and JPMorgan Chase, imploring them to leave the Strategic and Policy Forum. Once President Trump officially disbanded the forum, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, circulated a memo amongst his employees in which he categorically disagreed with President Trump's stance on the Charlottesville incident, a stance that many have found disturbingly ambivalent. To quote from Dimon's memo, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, “Racism, intolerance, and violence are always wrong,” there is “no room for equivocation here.” The Daily Beast interprets the disbanding of these councils as considerably damaging for President Trump's image, given his previous claims of being a friend and champion of business. The article suggests that the resultant fissure between the incumbent administration and the business world could potentially impact forthcoming tax reform efforts negatively. However, the disbanding of the councils seemed to have little to no adverse effect on the stock market. Barron's reported a gain of 30 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the midst of President Trump's announcement. This clearly indicates a degree of resilience within the market, at least in the short term, in the face of developments that could otherwise stir significant investor uncertainty."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Even with both Van Helsing and Dracula on his tail and after 20 years in exile, Dallas can't resist returning to L.A. to pay a visit to his dearest old friends -- beautiful Ulrike [Kim Cattrall], urbane Vincent [Udo Kier], artist Richard [Craig Ferguson], and Richard's ever-pregnant wife Panthia [Natasha Andreichenk]. To celebrate Dallas's return, the five of them decide to spend the night clubbing in one of Dracula's many vampire bars. Unfortunately, Dracula [Robert Pastorelli] is also there. When he sees Dallas is back in town, he gives him three days to scram or else.Dr Van Helsing [Rod Steiger], leader of Van Helsing's Institute of Vienna, also has his eye on the band of merrymaking vampires. \\"It's an infestation,\\" he concludes and realizes that he can't handle the extermination alone, so he puts an ad in the newspaper looking for a \\"strong and brave young man who's not afraid to get his hands dirty in a cause that is holy.\\" What he gets is Crip brother Time Bomb [Gabriel Casseus], who doesn't believe in vampires but is willing to put a stake through anyone's heart for 1,000 a week and a bonus of another 1,000 for every vampire killed.

Goran Bezina was born in Split, which is located in present-day Croatia. Although Croatia was a part of Yugoslavia when Bezina was born, neither Croatia nor Yugoslavia are or were a part of Russia. Bezina holds Swiss nationality and has played professional ice hockey primarily in Switzerland, for Genève-Servette HC of the National League (NL). While he did play for Medveščak Zagreb, it is important to note that Zagreb is a city in Croatia, not Russia. Although Medveščak Zagreb competed in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), which is a league that predominantly consists of Russian teams, it is not the same as playing for a Russian team. Furthermore, Bezina also played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Arizona Coyotes and for HC Fribourg-Gottéron, both of which are North American and Swiss teams, respectively.

Article: Image via AP Chelsea Manning, whose prison sentence will conclude this May after President Obama commuted her sentence in one of his final monumental acts in office, has published a heartfelt, hopeful open letter in The Guardian, crediting her fellow prisoners for helping her through her time served. It’s a testament to how brave she’s been throughout her ordeal—which for six years has been largely inhumane, much of it spent in solitary confinement—and a direct counter to any pervasive outside perception that imprisoned people lose their humanity just because they’re imprisoned. In her piece, Manning describes the intimacy that she apparently had with unnamed persons, and that they “kept me alive” (Manning was put on suicide watch at least twice during her incarceration). She writes: We were friends in a way few will ever understand. There was no room to be superficial. Instead, we bared it all. We could hide from our families and from the world outside, but we could never hide from each other. We argued, we bickered and we fought with each other. Sometimes, over absolutely nothing. But, we were always a family. We were always united. When the prison tried to break one of us, we all stood up. We looked out for each other. When they tried to divide us, and systematically discriminated against us, we embraced our diversity and pushed back. But, I also learned from all of you when to pick my battles. I grew up and grew connected because of the community you provided. It’s one of the clearest looks we’ve gotten at Manning’s life inside the prison at Fort Leavenworth, and despite the unsettling picture we’ve gotten so far, it depicts a deep emotional tenderness. “Not only did you teach me these important lessons, but you made sure I felt cared for. You were the people who helped me to deal with the trauma of my regular haircuts,” she writes. “You were the people who checked on me after I tried to end my life. You were the people that played fun games with me. Who wished me a Happy Birthday. We shared the holidays together. You were and will always be family.” Manning will be released on May 17, 2017. Read the entire letter here. ||||| To those who have kept me alive for the past six years: minutes after President Obama announced the commutation of my sentence, the prison quickly moved me out of general population and into the restrictive housing unit where I am now held. I know that we are now physically separated, but we will never be apart and we are not alone. Recently, one of you asked me “Will you remember me?” I will remember you. How could I possibly forget? You taught me lessons I would have never learned otherwise. When I was afraid, you taught me how to keep going. When I was lost, you showed me the way. When I was numb, you taught me how to feel.

When I was selfish, you taught me how to share. Sometimes, it took me a while to learn many things. Other times, I would forget, and you would remind me. We were friends in a way few will ever understand. There was no room to be superficial. Instead, we bared it all.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

See options at the end Sam liked apples and hated oranges, so he would never the Choose your answer from: 1). oranges at the supermarket.; 2). apples at the supermarket.;","completion":"Sam liked apples and hated oranges, so he would never choose to buy the oranges at the supermarket. This statement implies that Sam's affinity for apples and distaste for oranges dictate his decisions when shopping for fruits at the supermarket. The sentence encapsulates Sam's personal preference and showcases how it influences his actions in a specific scenario. In this situation, Sam's dislike for oranges leads him to refrain from purchasing them at the supermarket. This seems reasonable, as people tend to avoid products or items they do not enjoy or dislike. Sam's decision to not buy the oranges, therefore, highlights his adherence to his personal preferences and the relationship between his choices and his likes and dislikes. On the other hand, his love for apples would likely encourage him to buy apples at the supermarket. This suggests that Sam's choices in this context are guided by his individual tastes and inclinations. More specifically, Sam's predilection for apples would make him want to purchase them, particularly if he's fond of consuming them or using them in recipes, for instance. Furthermore, the sentence contains a contrast between Sam's preferences, as it highlights his love for apples and his disdain for oranges. This juxtaposition emphasizes the importance of these preferences on his choices when shopping at the supermarket and suggests that he may prioritize buying fruits he enjoys while avoiding those he dislikes. In conclusion, with the given options, the sentence correctly ends with, \\"Sam liked apples and hated oranges, so he would never buy the oranges at the supermarket.\\" This statement illustrates Sam's personal preferences and the influence they have on his decision-making process when purchasing fruits at the supermarket. By pointing out his love for apples and aversion to oranges, the sentence tells us that Sam's choices are shaped by what he enjoys and what he doesn't."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius. Guess a valid title for it!

What is the answer: Whose picture is on the 2 dollar bill?","completion":"The portrait on the 2 dollar bill is that of Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. Thomas Jefferson is an integral figure in American history, best known for his role as one of the primary authors of the Declaration of Independence. Born on April 13, 1743, in Shadwell, Virginia, Jefferson was highly influential in shaping the philosophical underpinnings of the United States. He firmly believed in individual freedom and the rights of men, values that would form the core of his vision for the new nation. Jefferson’s portrait was first placed on the 2 dollar bill in 1869. The engraving designer, Charles Burt, used a portrait of Thomas Jefferson by renowned American artist Gilbert Stuart as reference. The image of Jefferson was modified slightly in 1929 when all U.S. currency was changed to its present size. The picture of Jefferson used on the 2 dollar bill shows a mature man, reflecting his term as president. The 2 dollar bill itself is something of a rarity as it is not commonly in circulation as the other denominations. It was briefly discontinued and then reintroduced in its present form in 1976 as part of the bicentennial celebration. It was a way of honoring Jefferson and his significant contributions to the formation of the United States. On the back of the 2 dollar bill is a depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the document authoring the separation of the thirteen American colonies from Great Britain, which was largely written by Jefferson. The image was based on a painting by John Trumbull. It's important to note that the 2 dollar bills, albeit less circulated, is still in print and can be obtained at most banks, making it a novel and educational piece of currency that embodies a part of the vast legacy of one of America's Founding Fathers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Bosnians are using a chairlift to ascend the peaks of Mount Igman, which rise above Sarajevo. Extended and Detailed Explanation: The people of Bosnia, known as Bosnians, have found an efficient and enjoyable method for reaching the peaks of Mount Igman - by utilizing a chairlift. Mount Igman is a mountain situated prominently above the city of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The term \\"telesiyej\\" in the original text is borrowed from the French word \\"télésiège,\\" which means chairlift. The chairlift is an ingenious and popular mode of transport in alpine areas. It consists of a cable that is looped between two terminals and precisely driven by a motor. Along the cable, there are a series of chairs with safety restraints, which are designed to carry passengers safely up the mountain. These chairlifts have become somewhat synonymous with skiing and snowboarding activities; however, they also serve a practical purpose for general transportation and sightseeing in mountainous regions. Mount Igman, famous for its skiing and snowboarding slopes, has become a popular destination for sports enthusiasts and tourists looking to enjoy the breathtaking views of Sarajevo and its surrounding areas. The use of the chairlift makes it easier for people to access the mountain's peaks without having to navigate through its rugged terrain. Additionally, the chairlift offers a relaxing and scenic ride for those who prefer to enjoy the views without participating in winter sports. The fact that Bosnians embrace this modern form of transport highlights the innovative and forward-thinking nature of the people.

Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

Answer the following question: Years ago, I owned the very best dog in the world. I was a child when we got her. She grew up with me, and was always there when I needed her. She died during one of my college vacations. My heart broke then, and I knew that there would never be another dog like her. However, I was wrong. My next dog came into my life when I was married. My husband traveled for a living. and I was often lonely. This dog taught me to be patient. He always stayed at my side until the children were born, and then he became their guardian , too. When he passed away, my heart broke. I was sure I would never love another dog as much as I loved him. I was wrong again. We got the next one when the children were little. When he played with the children, he made them laugh. These days he spends more time with me since the children aren't around so much. He is, of course, the very best dog in the world. I wonder if that's part of the lesson: To teach us that love has a spirit that returns again and again and never really dies.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. But I can use this background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... What is an answer for this question: Which would be lighter, item A or item B? A:","completion":"Item B would be lighter. Item A is the Earth, which has a mean specific gravity of 5.515, whereas item B is a sample of surface rock with a typical specific gravity of 2.7–3.3.

HMV moves into fashion retailing By James Hall, Retail Editor Published: 9:46PM GMT 26 Mar 2010 The retail group has poached clothing executives from Marks & Spencer, Fat Face and Arcadia to spearhead the move. The first in-store fashion area – called The Studio – will open in HMV's store in Leeds next month. Simon Fox, HMV Group chief executive, said that The Studio area will be rolled out in 35 to 40 of the company's large stores over the next few months, and that smaller in-store clothing areas will open in HMV's remaining 230 UK stores by the summer. He said that music and fashion have becoming increasingly intertwined, with recording artists dabbling in fashion to an ever greater degree. Over the past few years Lily Allen has designed a range for New Look and Madonna has designed for H&M. Mr Fox said that earlier this month Amy Winehouse announced a tie-up with Fred Perry, the sportswear brand, while former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher has his own clothing range, called Pretty Green. \\"We sell their music, obviously, and we think we can sell their clothing too,\\" said Mr Fox. Some 3pc of HMV's current sales come from selling T-shirts and band-themed merchandise. The retailer now plans to increase this to 9pc of total sales. Mr Fox said that the chain will initially sell a far larger range of T-shirts, hats, sunglasses and accessories such as badges. He said that \\"in time\\" the chain will add third-party clothing lines, such as Ms Winehouse's. The ranges will also be sold in HMV's growing portfolio of concert venues and at its music festivals. The plans were unveiled as part of a strategy day that HMV Group had with investors and City analysts. The company said that is looking to open two to three new concert venues a year after its recent acquisition of Hammersmith Apollo-owner Mama Group. It has also targeted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) of £15m from its live music activities in the 2012 financial year. Meanwhile, Mr Fox unveiled plans to turnaround the Waterstone's book chain that HMV Group also owns. The chain is in talks to put stationery concessions in 20 of its largest shops. Dominic Myers, Waterstone's managing director, plans to improve net margins to 3pc-4pc over the medium term. They are currently at about 1.5pc. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about HMV, a retail company that sells music and movies, deciding to start selling clothes too.

To her disappointment, although he is very happy with her now and wouldn't marry someone else, he answers that he would not. Later that day, Harry Deever (Charles Halton), an Idaho county official, informs David that due to a jurisdictional mishap, their three-year-old marriage license from Idaho is not valid. Since Deever is a family acquaintance of Ann's from Idaho, he stops by their apartment to tell Ann and her mother (Esther Dale) the same thing. Ann does not mention this to David and thinks he will remarry her that very night, as he just invited her out to a romantic dinner at the fancy restaurant they ate at before they were married. When they arrive at the restaurant, however, they realize that the restaurant has turned into a seedy joint, and they head home. When Ann feels she has given David long enough to propose and leave to get married, she confronts him and accuses him of not wanting to marry her again. While David protests and says he was going to ask her shortly, Ann dismisses that and kicks him out of their apartment.

Answer:","completion":"The song \\"My Favorite Things\\" was featured in the beloved and iconic musical \\"The Sound of Music.\\" This musical was based on the memoir of Maria von Trapp, titled \\"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,\\" which narrates the life of an Austrian family during the events leading up to World War II. With music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, the musical made its debut on Broadway in 1959 and went on to achieve tremendous success, winning multiple Tony Awards. The Sound of Music tells the story of Maria, a young and free-spirited nun who takes on the role of a governess for the seven children of widowed naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp. Throughout the musical, the von Trapp family comes together through the love of music, facing challenges and eventually escaping Austria as the Nazi regime rises to power. The song \\"My Favorite Things\\" is one of the most popular and well-known numbers in the musical. It is sung by Maria, first at the abbey where she is a postulant, and later at the von Trapp household to the children she takes care of. The song serves as a means for Maria to both encourage herself and uplift the children during difficult times by focusing on the simple pleasures and joys of life. \\"My Favorite Things\\" highlights the various things that bring happiness and comfort to Maria, with lyrics listing her favorite things, such as \\"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens…\\" The melody and lyrics of the song have become synonymous with the musical itself and have been covered by numerous artists over the years. Apart from the original Broadway production in 1959, The Sound of Music has since seen numerous revivals, international productions, and adaptations. The 1965 film adaptation, directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp, became an instant classic and won five Academy Awards, further cementing the status of \\"My Favorite Things\\" as one of the most cherished songs in musical theater history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown.

Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 0.5-mile (0.80 km) swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\".

The equation we have is: 0 = -48*q + 1345 - 2785. 4. To start, let's add 2785 to both sides to get the constant numbers together: 2785 = -48*q + 1345. 5. Now, let's subtract 1345 from both sides of the equation: 2785 - 1345 = -48*q. 6. After we subtract, we get: 1440 = -48*q. 7.

This article recounts one such experience on a rainy day that offered great insight into the importance of resilience and self-compassion. By focusing on the theme of overcoming personal struggles, I aim to share my journey and inspire others to embrace their vulnerabilities and power through hardships. The Rainy Day Experience I can vividly remember that gloomy day: it was pouring with rain, and I was rushing to reach my destination on time. Streets were flooded, and the deafening sound of raindrops accompanied me everywhere I turned. Unexpectedly, a massive puddle emerged right before me. The only way to continue was to jump across or risk soaking my shoes and being late. Without hesitating, I took the leap and clumsily landed in the puddle. The Embarrassment and The Turning Point My trousers were covered in muddy water, and I could feel the dampness seeping into my shoes. At that moment, embarrassment and self-pity engulfed me. I contemplated turning back and returning home, ashamed of my failure to take a simple leap. However, I decided instead to pause, acknowledge my feelings, and redirect my focus to completing the task ahead. With my renewed determination, I continued to my destination, leaving behind the puddle and feelings of inadequacy. The Lessons Learned This simple yet meaningful event in my life proved to be a learning experience on multiple fronts. Primarily, it instilled in me the importance of resilience. Sometimes, life throws unexpected challenges our way, and our response to these obstacles shapes our outcomes. This rainy day taught me to confront my personal shortcomings, transform shame into determination, and push forward despite the circumstances. Moreover, the incident highlighted the significance of self-compassion. In today's fast-paced world, high expectations often weigh us down. While holding ourselves accountable is crucial, cultivating self-compassion is equally important. My rainy day escapade taught me that in moments of adversity, it is essential to pause, recognize our emotions and take affirming action. Nobody is infallible, and accepting our imperfections can lead us to be stronger individuals. Lastly, this event allowed me to better understand the importance of a positive attitude. Even in my soaked state, I chose to continue, adapting to the inconvenience of the situation. It is this attitude of inner strength that reveals our resilience and adaptability. In dealing with life's uncertainties, maintaining a positive outlook is essential for personal growth. Closing Thoughts That rainy day's experience, while a small event, played a defining role in my life. It served as a reminder to always strive for resilience, maintain self-compassion, and adopt a positive attitude in the face of adversity. Hopefully, my story inspires readers to embrace their personal struggles, learn from their experiences, and foster the resilience to withstand life's inevitable challenges. Remember, some of life's most meaningful lessons can arise on the rainiest days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is about a video game so it’s no big deal or anything, just something that’s bugging me a little. So this morning I had some extra time before my classes started, and since I usually spend my evenings reading I decided to start up Overwatch and play a competitive game of three. For anyone who doesn’t know, Overwatch is a FPS multiplayer, and the competitive mode in Overwatch involves two teams of six either pushing a payload or getting control of a certain point in the map. If someone leaves the competitive mode of this game, no new players are allowed in so you’re left facing a team of six with five players. You get penalized if you leave a competitive match, you lose 50 points and you’re not allowed to play in that mode for 10 minutes. During my the second game, everything was going fine until one of the members of my team left the game. My team tried but there was just no winning, so everyone except for me left. I wasn’t sure of the extent of the punishment I would receive for leaving a competitive match, and since there was only about 4 minutes left I figured I would just stick around and lose this game so that I could play again immediately after the game. No malicious intent on my part at all. At first the other team was sympathetic, but then two or three of them started complaining that I was punishing them by wasting their time because I was salty for my loss. I wanted to explain that this wasn’t the case, but then I figured that no matter what I say they will believe what they want, and there was only a minute left anyway. The messages got rather nasty and I was accused (among other things) of being a bad person and I’m pretty sure they reported my account. I didn’t get mean in my responses to them, just said it wasn’t my fault my team left either and that they were getting a free win, not how you’d want to play a game but not bad for them either. My reasoning was that they just needed to wait for a little while and get a free win, and we could all be on our merry way, but after thinking about it I’m feeling guilty. Maybe I should have just left and copped the admittedly mild punishment, and not wasted anyone else’s time.

The head of mall security, Ronald \\"Ronnie\\" Barnhardt (Rogen), makes it his mission to apprehend the offender. He is assisted by Charles, Dennis, and the Yuen twins (John and Matthew Yuan), in his efforts. The next day, Ronnie's dream girl, Brandi (Faris), who works a mall make-up counter, encounters the flasher. Ronnie tries to comfort her until a police officer, Detective Harrison, arrives and takes over Ronnie's palliative role. Ronnie is upset that his boss allowed an outsider to infringe on his search for the offender. The criminal activity at the mall continues, as a masked person is seen robbing a shoe store, causing property damage. Detective Harrison is once again called in to investigate, his efforts hindered by Ronnie, who thinks that Saddamn, an Arab shopkeeper in the mall is the thief, based on the fact that he is an Arab. Ronnie curses Saddamn out, and Harrison profanely excoriates Ronnie for this during a meeting with Ronnie's superior, and in response, Ronnie decides to take steps to become a police officer. As part of his preparations, Ronnie decides to ride along with Detective Harrison. Harrison, fed up with Ronnie, tricks him into walking into the most dangerous part of town, and drives off. Ronnie then confronts and subsequently assaults several drug dealers, victoriously returning to the police station with a dealer's son and thanking the detective for the opportunity to prove himself. Emboldened, Ronnie arranges a date with Brandi. On their date, Brandi sees Ronnie taking a prescription clonazepam, and thinking that Ronnie takes them recreationally, she asks him for the bottle. She consumes multiple tablets herself while drinking. Ronnie takes her home and rapes her while she is apparently semi-conscious, and at one point, when he stops mid-coitus, she says groggily, \\"Why are you stopping, motherfucker?\\", compelling him to continue. Ronnie passes the background check and physical examination for the... Answer:","completion":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage. You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Passage: Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I – IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. Question: What type of hypersensitivity takes between two and three weeks to develop?","completion":"Part 1: Determine if the question is answerable from the passage. Usage: The given question is \\"What type of hypersensitivity takes between two and three weeks to develop?\\". We can see that the passage provides information about the time course of Type IV hypersensitivity, which takes \\"between two and three days to develop.\\" Since the passage does not mention any hypersensitivity type taking between two and three weeks to develop, the question is not answerable. This meets the criteria because we are asked to determine whether the question is answerable based on the information provided in the passage. Part 2: Output 'True' if the question is answerable, and 'False' if not. Usage: Since the question is not answerable based on the information in the passage, the output should be 'False'.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Overrating Outrage in Obama’s Response to Paris Attacks With all the reporting and commentary that faulted President Obama for not displaying more anger at his news conference Monday on the Paris attacks, it almost seemed as if people hoped he would bring back Luther, the satirical “anger translator” played by Keegan-Michael Key who appeared alongside him at the White House Correspondents Dinner in April. Displays of emotion have become an expected ritual in the age of the televised presidency, but President Obama has often been reluctant to reveal how he feels after major events. This pattern goes back to the very beginning of his time in office. In March 2009, media reports criticized him for lacking visible emotion during a news conference in which he explicitly said he was angry about bonuses paid by American International Group after a taxpayer-funded bailout. He was again criticized for not showing more emotion during news conferences on the Gulf oil spill in 2010 and the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. Mr. Obama’s flat affect seems to reflect both his natural demeanor (“I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low”) and a decision to avoid displays of emotion that aren’t politically effective. Consider the issue of police misconduct. He has signaled his private outrage over recent cases, telling BET, “I’ll leave it to people to speculate on what I’m saying to myself or Michelle when we’re alone at night.” But as he explained in a GQ interview: “Expressing simple outrage without follow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening.” In the cases when Mr. Obama has deviated from his usual strategy and has appeared more emotional in public, it has frequently been politically explosive (as with the Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Trayvon Martin cases) or unsuccessful (promoting gun control after the mass shootings at Sandy Hook and in Charleston). Displays of anger may be particularly fraught for Mr. Obama given his status as the first black president; research suggests that he already tends to polarize Americans along racial as well as partisan lines. How much are we missing when the president won’t emote on cue? On the one hand, we should take symbolic representation seriously. It’s part of how elected leaders show that they share our values and can give voice to our feelings. People take great comfort in moments like President Reagan’s “surly bonds of earth” eulogy after the Challenger explosion, President Clinton’s speech at the Oklahoma City bombing memorial and George W. Bush’s bullhorn address to 9/11 rescue workers. At the same time, we can’t presume to know what politicians actually think or feel; these are highly skilled performers who are strategic in the emotions that they choose to publicly display and can use these to distract and inflame us. Moreover, we face the danger of confusing the symbolic expression of emotion with an effective policy response. Pounding the podium might be satisfying for viewers or reporters who want Mr. Obama to “kill the bastards,” but it won’t destroy ISIS. Summary:","completion":"Critics argue that President Obama failed to display enough anger in response to the Paris attacks, however, this article argues that displays of emotion have become an expected ritual in the age of the televised presidency, but Obama has often been reluctant to reveal how he feels after major events. Criticisms go back to the beginning of his time as President, when he was criticised for lacking visible emotion during a new conference in which he explicitly said he was angry about bonuses paid by AIG after a taxpayer-funded bailout.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The given sentence in Finnish is: \\"Kukaan ei ole vielä sanonut, että ihmiset luovat työpaikkoja.\\" Translated to English, it means: \\"No one has yet said that people create jobs.\\" To provide a detailed and long answer, let's analyze the translated sentence: The sentence expresses the idea that up until the current moment, nobody has made the statement or claimed the belief that people generate or establish job positions. This could be an observation within a specific context - it may refer to a discussion or debate on the topic of job creation, or it might be a comment on the general discourse on employment and economic growth. The sentiment emphasizes the role of people in influencing the job market, where individuals and organizations determine the number of job opportunities available through their decisions and actions. There are several ways through which people create jobs, including starting a business, expanding existing businesses, investing in new technologies or industries, and demanding products and services that lead to job creation. Governments, too, play a role in job creation, by providing policies and funding that encourage the growth of industries, research, and infrastructure. This, in turn, leads to more jobs being available for the population as businesses and organizations need more employees to cater to the increased demand and growth. Job creation is an essential part of a healthy economy, as it provides opportunities for individuals to earn a living, contribute to their communities, and foster economic growth in their region or country. While the original translated sentence highlights a lack of acknowledgement on the significance of people's contributions to job creation, it is essential to recognize the collective impact of people on the job market and the economy as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This ridge-line is created by tying a length of rope tightly between two trees or other points of support. This will create a point that you can secure your tarp to and finish your shelter. Find two trees that are as far apart as your tarp is long. Tie one end of the rope around the trunk of a tree. Tie it at the height that you want the top of your shelter to be at. Tie the other end of the rope at the same level on the opposite tree. It's very important that the ridge-line is as tight as it can be. The lean-to tarp shelter requires you to fix one edge of your tarp to your ridge-line. You can attach the tarp to the ridge-line using cord or rope and many tarps will come with grommets or loops built in. Make sure you attach the tarp to the ridge-line tightly to build a strong tarp shelter. Your tarp may have holes pre-made along its edge. If so, you can thread the ridge-line through these for an easy way to join them together. Many tarps will have loops along the corners or edges that can be used to tie them to your ridge-line. Once the top edge has been tied to the ridge-line, you can secure the bottom edge of the lean-to tarp shelter. Pull the bottom edge away from the center until it is at an angle that you want. Place anchoring stakes in the ground at the corners of the tarp and tie the tarp to them. This will hold the bottom portion of your shelter securely in place. Most people recommend using a 45 degree angle for their lean-to. Try adjusting the angle to raise or lower the height of the shelter's \\"ceiling\\".","completion":"The article describes how to build a lean-to tarp shelter by tying a tight ridge-line between two trees, securing the tarp to the ridge-line, and anchoring the bottom edge at a 45-degree angle for a sturdy and adjustable outdoor shelter."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
