You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: With fresh evidence of a bloated bureaucracy in Detroit's Water and Sewerage Department, Mayor Dave Bing and the Detroit Water Board embraced a consultant's plan Wednesday that calls for eliminating four of every five employees over five years. The department, which has prompted suburban outrage by doubling rates in the past decade for its 4.3 million customers, plans to outsource billing, maintenance and other functions and hopes to save 900 million. Don't expect rebates or lower rates going forward, officials said Wednesday, but the plan aims to slow the rate hikes, which have averaged 8% annually in recent years. \\"These changes will not come without sacrifices,\\" Bing said Wednesday, adding that he felt for workers who are likely to lose their jobs. \\"We're working to limit the amount of increase in water rates for everyone.\\" Water board members used words such as \\"shock and awe\\" to describe their reaction to the consultant's report. Fred Barnes, who represents Macomb County on the board, said, \\"My jaw would still be on the floor\\" if board chairman James Fausone hadn't given him a heads up on the findings. Workers were immediately skeptical. \\"It's not possible. They don't have enough people as it is right now,\\" said John Riehl, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 207, which represents hundreds of water workers. \\"They are just dreaming to think they operate that plant with less.\\" Riehl said consultants and computers can't dig up a leaking pipe or fix a damaged machine -- those things only get done \\"by a worker with a wrench in his hand.\\" Riehl said his union will fight the job cuts. Bing brushed off accusations of union-busting, saying that's \\"the farthest thing from my mind.\\" \\"There are too many people who fight change, and the status quo got us where we are,\\" he said. The recommendation calls for the department to cut its work force 81% from 1,978 employees currently to about 374 over five years. An additional 361 outside employees would work for the department on contracts, bringing the total workforce to 735, about 63% below current levels. All job descriptions would be rewritten to be much broader than current ones to allow more flexibility. Brian Hurding, vice president of EMA, the firm that did the study, said the department had 257 job classifications, including \\"horseshoer.\\" \\"We didn't find any horses,\\" Hurding said. \\"That's the strangest job classification I've ever seen.\\" He noted later that the person in the job also was classified as a welder, which was his main job. Under the reorganization plan, the number of job classifications would fall to 31. Hurding said employees are hungry for changes. He said he interviewed a plumber who was sent to fix a broken pipe. \\"He had to wait half a day for an operator to come to shut off the valve so he could fix the pipe,\\" Hurding said. Under new job classifications, the plumber would be trained to close the valve himself so he could fix the pipe immediately, Hurding said. Although the water board was positive about the recommendations, several members said they wanted to verify the potential savings and the workability of the plan. \\"I think we have to have sensitivity, not only from a business standpoint, but also from a humanitarian standpoint,\\" said James Thrower, vice chairman of the board. Thrower stopped short of asking for a second firm to confirm the findings, but said he wants to verify the results in other places that have gone through similar reorganizations. Other board members agreed that they want to validate the results. Detroit City Council President Pro-Tem Gary Brown said the kinds of changes the department is pursuing could work in other areas of city government. \\"I think\\" the water department \\"is going to be a model for how every department in the city should be operating,\\" he said. Water department director Sue McCormick said she hoped to make most of the reductions through attrition, though she wouldn't rule out layoffs. She couldn't say when the reductions might begin. She said about 200 workers leave the department each year for other jobs and retirement. Workers don't appear to have many chances to fight the plan. The department's authority to make wholesale changes stems from a federal court order issued in a long-running pollution lawsuit. Last fall, U.S. District Judge Sean Cox told city officials they could ignore the city charter, local laws and even union contracts to meet requirements of the Clean Water Act. The order lifted limits on outsourcing and eased work rules to allow managers more flexibility. Cox made it clear that he viewed a more efficient department as necessary to meet pollution rules. Detroit Chief Operating Officer Chris Brown said Cox hasn't been briefed on the report and probably won't be. The judge sets the goal and the department must find a way to meet it, Brown said. The department awarded EMA a 175,000 contract to conduct the study, and consultants interviewed more than 200 employees as part of it. The report found that the department spends about 44% of its income paying down almost 6 billion in outstanding debt for things such as pipes and treatment plants. Because those costs are set for the long-term, any savings must come from operations. \\"We found the organization is siloed, with inflexible job descriptions, multiple reporting levels and a lack of training,\\" Hurding said. The study found the average cost per employee was 86,135, which includes wages and benefits. Hurding noted that savings can only be achieved by upgrading technology, outsourcing and retraining employees for new skills. McCormick said the department will expect employees to have higher, more diverse skills and it will likely pay them more. Cox's order exempts the water department from many of the pay grades and other work regulations that other city employees fall under. \\"We have to be competitive to attract the kind of people we need,\\" McCormick said. Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner John McCulloch said the report confirms what past studies have found: a bloated, inefficient department. \\"The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department was the quote, unquote, dumping ground for city employees for decades,\\" McCulloch said. \\"Given the cumbersome nature of city ordinances and contracts, it was very difficult to run this very efficiently.\\" McCulloch sat through the presentation and later said he was cautiously optimistic. Like several board members, he wants confirmation of the savings before proceeding. \\"You need a second opinion because of the magnitude of the dollars involved,\\" he said.

Yet even with a department so bloated that it has a horseshoer and no horses, the local union president said it is \\"not possible\\" to eliminate positions. Union rules have turned the department into a government jobs program, some critics say. The horseshoer’s job description is \\"to shoe horses and to do general blacksmith work … and to perform related work as required.\\" The description was last updated in 1967. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has a large debt, rising water prices and inefficient services — using almost twice the number of employees per gallon as other cities like Chicago. A recent independent report about the DWSD recommends that the city trim more than 80 percent of the department’s workforce. The consultant who wrote the report found 257 job descriptions, including a horseshoer. Capitol Confidential sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the department for the salary, benefits and job description of the horseshoer position. In response to the report, John Riehl, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 207, which represents many of the DWSD employees, told the Detroit Free Press that the department needs more workers. \\"They don't have enough people as it is right now,\\" Riehl said. \\"They are just dreaming to think they can operate that plant with less.\\" But critics say this is just another example of city departments operating as a jobs program for union employees. \\"They have said for years that they don't have enough people,\\" said Roi Chinn, a former city administrator and 2013 mayoral candidate for Detroit. \\"As the bureaucracy thickens and union power grows, there is always a built in reflex … to want more. \\"Whenever you think you’ve heard the bad about the city of Detroit, it gets worse.\\" Chinn said if he was mayor he would sell the water department. Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor for the Detroit Free Press, wrote last week about the \\"intolerable waste\\" in the water department. \\"For unions and the whole idea of collective bargaining, this is the kind of report that just makes any sort of future very, very hard to negotiate,\\" Henderson wrote. \\"It suggests that collective bargaining turns government into a provider of jobs instead of public services.\\" Daniel Edwards, a construction contracts manager with the DWSD, said the employee was transferred from the Detroit Police Department five years ago. The police department has horses, though the DWSD horseshoer no longer works with animals. \\"DWSD has a blacksmith shop in our Central Services Facility,\\" Edwards said. The shop \\"also ... repairs equipment and works with various metals and welding for the department when needed.\\" The horseshoer now works at the Central Services Facility. The city pays 29,245 in salary and about 27,000 in benefits for the horseshoer position. ~~~~~ See also: Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Shows Problem With Government Unions Detroit Tries To Salvage Water Department The Public Employee Union Problem |||||","completion":"Detroit's Water and Sewerage Department, which has been under scrutiny for its bloated bureaucracy, plans to eliminate 80% of its workforce over a period of five years after a consultant's report recommended a massive reduction in employees.

He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when Native Americans lived there. Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's chief ranger, Michael Kelly, and photographer Allison Corwin, daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge, blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who tells him that all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest. During a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Deciding to soak her feet, she is unaware that the bear is lurking under the falls, and she is attacked and killed. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. He informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene-era Arctodus ursos horribilis) standing at least 15 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it.

The sun was setting when Natalie accidentally hit a possum while driving her car through the woods. Horrified, she pulled over and checked on the small animal. To her relief, the possum was still alive, but appeared to be in pain. She knew she couldn't just leave it there with possible severe injuries, so she quickly pulled out her phone to see if there was a nearby veterinary clinic. Fortunately, she found one not too far away, Samantha's Veterinary Clinic, and immediately decided she had to make the drive, hoping Samantha could save the injured creature. Natalie carefully wrapped the possum in a soft blanket she had in her car and placed it on the passenger seat. Throughout the drive to the clinic, she kept glancing back to make sure it was still alive while following the GPS directions. After an anxious 10 minutes, Natalie made it to the clinic just as Samantha was preparing to close for the day. Upon seeing Natalie carrying the injured animal, Samantha could tell this was an emergency. She reopened her clinic and warmly welcomed Natalie inside. The possum was now laid on the examination table, its shallow breaths indicative of the pain it was experiencing. Samantha gently inspected the animal, noting the fractures in its legs and a few scratches on its body. Samantha explained to Natalie that the possum would require surgery to repair the fractures, and would then need time to recover under her care. Grateful to have found someone who was willing to help, Natalie agreed to bear the cost of the procedure, even though she knew it could be expensive. The veterinarian swiftly prepped the operating room while Natalie waited nervously in the reception area. Samantha's knowledge and experience shone through as she meticulously operated on the possum, working steadily to repair the broken bones and suture its wounds. Although it took a couple of hours, the surgery was a success. Samantha administered some pain medication and antibiotics to the possum, ensuring its recovery would be as comfortable as possible. Days went by, and Natalie regularly called Samantha to receive updates on the possum's progress. Under Samantha's watchful eye and expert care, the animal began to recuperate faster than anticipated. It wasn't long before the possum was ready to venture back into the wild. On the day of its release, Natalie met Samantha at the clinic, her heart swelling with joy at the prospect of returning the small creature to its home. Together, they drove back to the spot in the woods where the accident had occurred. Holding the possum in her arms, Natalie could feel the animal's eagerness to return to its natural habitat. With tears in her eyes, she thanked Samantha profusely for her kindness and dedication in saving the possum's life. The two women watched as the possum scurried into the underbrush, disappearing into the thick woodland. Natalie knew that Samantha's veterinary expertise had turned a potential tragedy into a heartwarming story - a story she'd treasure for years to come. As the sun began to set, they stood amidst the trees, a gentle evening breeze rustling the leaves around them. The events unfolding in the last few days reminded them of the importance of compassion, empathy, and the power of working together to make a difference in the lives of others, regardless of how small or inconsequential it may seem to some."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States. During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless. Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions. Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. Who was replaced","completion":"Ok, little buddy, let me explain this to you. Expose is a music group who sings and dances. They had some changes in their group members while making their first album. The ones who left or were replaced were the original singers - Alejandra Lorenzo, Sandra Casanas, and Laurie Miller. Alejandra Lorenzo decided she wanted to leave, and Sandra Casanas went to sing on her own. Laurie Miller also started a solo career.

Thomas Stearns Eliot, (26 September 1888 - 4 January 1965) was a British essayist, publisher, playwright, literary and social critic, and \\"one of the twentieth century's major poets\\". He moved from his native United States to England in 1914 at the age of 25, settling, working, and marrying there. He eventually became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39, renouncing his American passport. Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement. In a letter to Aiken late in December 1914, Eliot, aged 26, wrote, \\"I am very dependent upon women (I mean female society).\\" Less than four months later, Thayer introduced Eliot to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, a Cambridge governess. They were married at Hampstead Register Office on 26 June 1915. After a short visit alone to his family in the United States, Eliot returned to London and took several teaching jobs, such as lecturing at Birkbeck College, University of London. The philosopher Bertrand Russell took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. Some scholars have suggested that she and Russell had an affair, but the allegations were never confirmed. The marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne's health issues. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, fatigue, insomnia, migraines, and colitis. This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a lunatic asylum, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play Tom & Viv, which in 1994 was adapted as a film. In a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \\"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land.\\" By 1932, Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his wife for some time. When Harvard offered him the Charles Eliot Norton professorship for the 1932-1933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital, Stoke Newington, in 1938, and remained there until she died. Although Eliot was still legally her husband, he never visited her. From 1938 to 1957 Eliot's public companion was Mary Trevelyan of London University, who wanted to marry him and left a detailed memoir. From 1946 to 1957, Eliot shared a flat at 19 Carlyle Mansions, Chelsea, with his friend John Davy Hayward, who collected and managed Eliot's papers, styling himself \\"Keeper of the Eliot Archive\\". Hayward also collected Eliot's pre-Prufrock verse, commercially published after Eliot's death as Poems Written in Early Youth. When Eliot and Hayward separated their household in 1957, Hayward retained his collection of Eliot's papers, which he bequeathed to King's College, Cambridge, in 1965. On 10 January 1957, at the age of 68, Eliot married Esme Valerie Fletcher, who was 30. In contrast to his first marriage, Eliot knew Fletcher well, as she had been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in a church at 6:15 am with virtually no one in attendance other than his wife's parents. Eliot had no children with either of his wives. In the early 1960s, by then in failing health, Eliot worked as an editor for the Wesleyan University Press, seeking new poets in Europe for publication. After Eliot's death, Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy, by editing and annotating The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. Valerie Eliot died on 9 November 2012 at her home in London. For a poet of his stature, Eliot produced a relatively small number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \\"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\\" Typically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets, and then collected them in books. His first collection was Prufrock and Other Observations (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in Ara Vos Prec (London) and Poems: 1920 (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \\"Ode\\" in the British edition was replaced with \\"Hysteria\\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected The Waste Land and the poems in Prufrock and Poems into one volume and added The Hollow Men to form Poems: 1909-1925. From then on, he updated this work as Collected Poems. Exceptions are Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (1939), a collection of light verse; Poems Written in Early Youth, posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in The Harvard Advocate, and Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909-1917, material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997. During an interview in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality and its role in his work: \\"I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America.\\" Cleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions, notably the Upanishads. From the Sanskrit ending of The Waste Land to the \\"What Krishna meant\\" section of Four Quartets shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process. It must also be acknowledged, as Chinmoy Guha showed in his book Where the Dreams Cross: T S Eliot and French Poetry (Macmillan, 2011), that he was deeply influenced by French poets from Baudelaire to Paul Valery. He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \\"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\\" (\\"Yeats,\\" On Poetry and Poets, 1948) Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the response?","completion":"Thomas Stearns Eliot, or T.S. Eliot, was a famous writer and poet who was born in the United States but moved to England when he was 25 years old. He wrote many important poems and became a British citizen later in his life. He had two marriages, one with a lady named Vivienne who had health problems, and then with a lady named Esme Valerie Fletcher. Even though he wrote only a few poems, they were very famous, and he believed they were perfect in their own way. Eliot's writings were influenced by both American and French poets, as well as Hinduism and other Indic traditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Germany attempted to use Indian nationalism and pan-Islamism to its advantage, instigating uprisings in India, and sending a mission that urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central powers. However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards Britain. Indian political leaders from the Indian National Congress and other groups were eager to support the British war effort, since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of Indian Home Rule. The Indian Army in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the central government and the princely states sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition.

Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the British government to grant self-government to India after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and fuelled the campaign for full independence that would be led by Mohandas K.

Article: HINDELOOPEN, Netherlands | HINDELOOPEN, Netherlands Feb 8 (Reuters) - Ice fever is sweeping the Netherlands where thousands of ice skaters are waiting to hear whether a historic race through 11 Dutch cities will be held this month, the first time since 1997. Some 16,000 competitors are hoping to take part in the 200-km (124 mile) Elfstedentocht marathon along the frozen canals in the Dutch province of Friesland for the first time in more than a decade. On Wednesday evening, race organisers deferred a decision, saying ice conditions were still not right. \\"At this moment we cannot organise the race, as the ice is not thick enough on some parts of the route,\\" Wiebe Wieling, president of the organising committee, told a press conference. A thaw is expected to set in on Sunday, but some weather forecasts show the cold snap could resume at the end of next week, he said, adding the committee would \\"remain on standby\\". While much of Europe rued the bitter cold snap, the Dutch have religiously followed weather reports, ice updates and bulletins from the organisation that decides whether conditions are right for the marathon race. In homes, bars and offices the talk all week has centred on whether it was cold enough for the canal water to freeze evenly, whether the snow blanket was too thick, hampering ice formation, and whether the ice would reach the required 15 cm (6 inches) of thickness needed along the entire course. Official \\"ice masters\\" or district heads, nominated by the local skating clubs, have been out checking the ice with poles and metal spikes. A regiment of soldiers were drafted in to clear away snow in the hopes of speeding ice formation. \\"We don't have any weak spots any more in my district,\\" said local ice master Gauke Bootsma as he stood on a frozen canal in the historic merchant and fishing town of Hindeloopen, one of the 11 cities of Friesland. Every day he measures the ice with a sharp, antique hook. In the southern district of Balk, conditions were uncertain and the ice too thin on some stretches. \\"We wanted to scrape the ice with a machine yesterday, but it was too heavy and fell through the ice, so we have had to do the work by hand,\\" said Auke Hylkema, Balk's ice master, who fell through the ice on a lake on Saturday while measuring its thickness. Thousands of men and women have been preparing feverishly for the race: to participate, one must be a member of the Elfstedentocht association, and out of more than 30,000 members, only about 16,000 skaters are allowed to compete. They set off from Leeuwarden in staggered batches of several hundred skaters, the first ones at 5.00 a.m. in the winter dark, while the last lot bring up the rear at about 10 a.m. Wrapped up against the biting cold, and fortified along the way by hot chocolate and pea soup, they skate all day across ice that's been sculpted into lumps and ridges by the wind or ironed smooth by man. \\"It all depends on the wind. A strong wind makes skating hard. Though I'm getting a bit older now, I'm 90 percent sure I will make it,\\" said Tsjalling Pasma, 59, from Balk. \\"I go skating every Sunday at an artificial ice rink to keep in form.\\" A veteran, Pasma skated the Elfstedentocht in 1985, 1986 and 1997, and expects it will take him about 12 hours to finish. The record was set by cattle farmer Evert van Benthem in 1985 with a time of 6 hours and 47 minutes. He became a national hero after winning the race twice in a row, in 1985 and 1986. But for most Dutch, it's not about winning but about getting out on the ice. Skating fever has largely knocked the euro crisis and the troubles in Syria off the front page for now and could even be co-opted by politicians. Geert Wilders' Freedom Party wants the day of the race to be declared an official holiday so \\"everyone can enjoy it\\", while Prime Minister Mark Rutte remarked that \\"once every 15 years our country is not governed from The Hague but by 22 district heads in Friesland. And our country is in good hands.\\" (Reporting by Tjibbe Hoekstra; Editing by Sara Webb and Paul Casciato) ||||| By Charles Hawley The event hasn't been held for 15 years. But, this week, Holland is abuzz with anticipation that the famed \\"11 Cities Tour\\" might take place in the coming days. All that's needed are a few more cold nights before 16,000 skaters can take to the 200-kilometer course. The activity is reminiscent of a small Alpine town after a blizzard. Thousands of volunteers this week have grabbed their shovels and are frantically clearing away a thick layer of white stuff amid frigid temperatures. Even military troops have joined in the effort. But the scenes are not from a mountain village buried by a heavy snowstorm. Rather, the massive army of helpers can be found in the Netherlands, where the entire nation is excitedly anticipating the prospect of a massive ice-skating event -- and one that hasn't been held for 15 years. Called the Elfstedentocht, or 11 Cities Tour, the event follows a course almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) long through the extensive network of canals, lakes and rivers in Friesland, the Dutch province in the very north of the tiny country, passing through 11 towns in the region. And it can only be held when the ice along the entire track reaches a thickness of 15 centimeters (six inches). \\"We have to be sure the ice is safe,\\" Immie Jonkman, a board member of the Frisian Eleven Cities Association, which organizes the event, told SPIEGEL ONLINE. \\"The ice on some parts of the course is really great. But, in other parts, it's really bad.\\" Royal Participation With a frigid high pressure system having been parked over northern Europe for the last week, canals in Amsterdam, Utrecht and elsewhere in the country have been jammed with skaters, and some cafés in the capital have even set up tables and chairs on the frozen waterways. The national obsession with skating has only heightened the excitement about the possibility that the Elfstedentocht could once again be held. The event, the brainchild of Willem \\"Pim\\" Mulier, was first held in 1909. But given the need for a long cold snap to create the necessary conditions, it has only been held 14 times since then. When it is held, though, it's a national event. While only 16,000 skaters are allowed to participate, there were some 1.5 million onlookers lining the route in 1997, the last time it was held. In 1986, Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander famously took part in the race. \\"It's just a skating event,\\" Jonkman said. \\"But there is something mythical about it.\\" That, it would appear, is an understatement. Thousands of volunteers swarmed onto the canals on Tuesday to clear away snow after organizers voiced concerns that the white blanket could be hampering ice formation. On Wednesday, some 50 soldiers joined them, focusing on an alternate route should weak ice along the preferred course not thicken sufficiently. 'Extremely Excited' Hotels along the course are already booked out, with some media organizations having made their reservations fully two weeks ago in anticipation that the event might be held. All the country's newspapers -- from serious to yellow -- have been devoting substantial coverage to race preparations, with the tabloid De Telegraaf even pasting an Elfstedentocht banner across its homepage. Jonkman said that race organizers are planning to meet on Wednesday night to discuss ice conditions along the course, but he added that it wasn't certain that a final decision would be made at the meeting. Time, though, is short. While frigid weather is expected to last through the weekend, warmer weather could roll in as soon as Monday. Should the event take place, only association members are allowed to participate. Tickets are issued by invitation only, with some members granted a slot in even numbered years and others in odd numbered years -- all for the privilege of joining a gruelling contest across 200 kilometers of ice. \\"The fun of it is doing the whole thing,\\" said Jonkman. \\"You're not supposed to do just part of it. We are extremely excited.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The Elfstedentocht marathon, a historic 200-km ice skating race through 11 Dutch cities, may be held this month for the first time since 1997.

Beware of sellers who do not have dealer logos . You may be buying clones and manufacturer will not honor the warranty when buying from unauthorized dealers or fake dealers . How can the buyer determine whether the merchandise is authentic ?","completion":"To determine whether the merchandise is authentic, buyers can take several steps before and during the purchasing process. Implementing these strategies will help ensure that they buy genuine products and avoid any potential scams from unauthorized or fake dealers. Here are some suggestions to filter out the counterfeit items: 1. Research the manufacturer: Start by familiarizing yourself with the brand and the manufacturer of the merchandise you are interested in purchasing. Verify that the product is listed in the manufacturer's catalog and that the manufacturer has a reputable history of producing the item. 2. Authorized dealer list: Visit the manufacturer's official website to find the list of authorized dealers. These dealers will have an official partnership with the manufacturer and are authorized to sell their products. Purchasing from an authorized dealer ensures that the merchandise is genuine, and the manufacturer will honor warranties. 3. Verify the seller's credentials: Check the dealer's qualifications before making a purchase. Authorized dealers often display their credentials on their website or store. If in doubt, contact the manufacturer to confirm whether the dealer is authorized to sell the merchandise. 4. Dealer logos: Genuine authorized dealers often have dealer logos on their websites or promotional materials. Verify that the logo is consistent with those found on the manufacturer's website, and check if the dealer's name appears on the manufacturer's list of authorized dealers. 5. Reviews and testimonials: Look for customer reviews and testimonials to gauge the dealer's reputation. This can help identify if the dealer is engaged in selling counterfeit products. For online shopping, sites like Google, Yelp, and Trustpilot can provide valuable insight into the legitimacy of the dealer. 6. Product pricing: If the price of the merchandise seems too good to be true, it may be a sign of a counterfeit product. Compare the prices of the merchandise across multiple authorized dealers to gauge the product’s standard price. 7. Inspect the product packaging and details: When you receive the product, examine the packaging for signs of authenticity. Genuine products usually come in high-quality packaging with the manufacturer’s logo. Compare the product to images found on the manufacturer's website, or use any available serial numbers to verify authenticity. 8. Warranty and return policy: A reputable authorized dealer will typically offer a warranty along with a reasonable return policy. Avoid dealers that do not provide a warranty or have a dubious return policy, as this could be a sign of counterfeit merchandise. 9. Seek expert advice: If you are still unsure about the authenticity of the product, consult an expert or take the item to a professional for assessment. By taking these precautions, buyers can minimize their potential exposure to counterfeit products and make informed decisions when purchasing items from dealers. Always remember that it is better to be cautious when buying high-value merchandise to ensure that you are investing in an authentic product, rather than taking risks with unauthorized or fake dealers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint if they have no element in common. Equivalently, disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not. - The Zarankiewicz problem , an unsolved problem in mathematics , asks for the largest possible number of edges in a bipartite graph that has a given number of vertices but has no complete bipartite subgraphs of a given size . It belongs to the field of extremal graph theory , a branch of combinatorics , and is named after the Polish mathematician Kazimierz Zarankiewicz , who proposed several special cases of the problem in 1951 . The Kvári -- Sós -- Turán theorem , named after Tamás Kvári , Vera T. Sós , and Pál Turán , provides an upper bound on the solution to the Zarankiewicz problem . When the forbidden complete bipartite subgraph has one side with at most three vertices , this bound has been proven to be within a constant factor of the correct answer . For larger forbidden subgraphs , it remains the best known bound , and has been conjectured to be tight . Applications of the Kvári -- Sós -- Turán theorem include bounding the number of incidences between different types of geometric object in discrete geometry . - In mathematics, topology (from the Greek , \\"place\\", and , \\"study\\") is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. This can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space. Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness. - Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. Aspects of combinatorics include counting the structures of a given kind and size (enumerative combinatorics), deciding when certain criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in combinatorial designs and matroid theory), finding \\"largest\\", \\"smallest\\", or \\"optimal\\" objects (extremal combinatorics and combinatorial optimization), and studying combinatorial structures arising in an algebraic context, or applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial problems (algebraic combinatorics). - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - Algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that employs methods of abstract algebra, notably group theory and representation theory, in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in algebra. - Extremal graph theory is a branch of the mathematical field of graph theory. Extremal graph theory studies extremal (maximal or minimal) graphs which satisfy a certain property. Extremality can be taken with respect to different graph invariants, such as order, size or girth. More abstractly, it studies how global properties of a graph influence local substructures of the graph. - In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets formula_1 and formula_2 (that is, formula_1 and formula_2 are each independent sets) such that every edge connects a vertex in formula_1 to one in formula_2. Vertex sets formula_1 and formula_2 are usually called the \\"parts\\" of the graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles. - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. - Enumerative combinatorics is an area of combinatorics that deals with the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed. Two examples of this type of problem are counting combinations and counting permutations. More generally, given an infinite collection of finite sets \\"S\\" indexed by the natural numbers, enumerative combinatorics seeks to describe a \\"counting function\\" which counts the number of objects in \\"S\\" for each \\"n\\". Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions. - Combinatorial design theory is the part of combinatorial mathematics that deals with the existence, construction and properties of systems of finite sets whose arrangements satisfy generalized concepts of \\"balance\\" and/or \\"symmetry\\". These concepts are not made precise so that a wide range of objects can be thought of as being under the same umbrella. At times this might involve the numerical sizes of set intersections as in block designs, while at other times it could involve the spatial arrangement of entries in an array as in Sudoku grids. - In applied mathematics and theoretical computer science, combinatorial optimization is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. In many such problems, exhaustive search is not feasible. It operates on the domain of those optimization problems, in which the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to discrete, and in which the goal is to find the best solution. Some common problems involving combinatorial optimization are the travelling salesman problem (\\"TSP\\") and the minimum spanning tree problem (\\"MST\\"). - Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (2 May 1902 5 September 1959) was a Polish mathematician, interested primarily in topology. - Extremal combinatorics is a field of combinatorics, which is itself a part of mathematics. Extremal combinatorics studies how large or how small a collection of finite objects (numbers, graphs, vectors, sets, etc.) can be, if it has to satisfy certain restrictions. - In mathematics graph theory is the study of \\"graphs\\", which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of \\"vertices\\", \\"nodes\\", or \\"points\\" which are connected by \\"edges\\", \\"arcs\\", or \\"lines\\". A graph may be \\"undirected\\", meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be \\"directed\\" from one vertex to another; see Graph (discrete mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. - In combinatorics, a branch of mathematics, a matroid is a structure that abstracts and generalizes the notion of linear independence in vector spaces. There are many equivalent ways to define a matroid, the most significant being in terms of independent sets, bases, circuits, closed sets or flats, closure operators, and rank functions.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Where lawmakers stand on the Iran deal On Sept. 2, President Obama secured enough support in the Senate to preserve the Iran nuclear deal after Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) pledged to back the agreement. Congress has until mid-September to review the deal, which lawmakers will vote on a yes-or-no resolution. Here's what it needs for approval. Opponents need a simple majority, or 218 votes, to reject the deal. There are 246 Republicans in the House, and itâs safe to assume they will all vote against the deal. Opponents there need 60 votes against the deal to break a filibuster and reject the deal. President Obama reviews their decision If both chambers of Congress reject the deal, Obama will veto their action. Opponents would need 290 votes to override Obamaâs veto. That means opponents need 44 Democratic votes to reject the deal outright. To kill the deal, the Senate would also have to override Obamaâs veto, with 67 votes. It is safe to assume that all House Republicans will vote for the disapproval resolution. 246 218 votesto reject the deal 290 votesTo suspend the rules or override a veto How the 188 House Democrats say they will vote: Democrats leaning against the deal Democrats leaning for the deal 60 votesto overcome a filibuster 67 votesto override a veto How Senators say they will vote: Senators leaning against the deal Senators leaning for the deal POWER POST | Congress unlikely to override an Obama veto in Iran nuclear fight â for now GRAPHIC | The world leaders involved in the Iran nuclear deal used their public power as a negotiation tool.

Article: Robert Frost was at heart a mean-spirited human being, not the kind of man one would expect to write poetry. He was born in San Francisco. Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable . His talent for poetry is natural-born and he had discovered this when he started to farm. Even though he treated his wife and children terribly, he still became one of the best-known poets of his and our day. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population. - Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known in popular culture for his massenergy equivalence formula (which has been dubbed \\"the world's most famous equation\\"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"services to theoretical physics\\", in particular his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania.

However, saying the right answer to the question \\"what does testosterone stimulate reproductive tissues to develop?\\" is \\"pDAs\\" is incorrect because pDA does not refer to a literal physiological component of the reproductive system. Instead, pDA commonly stands for Personal Digital Assistant. Testosterone, a hormone, primarily produced in males by the testes under the influence of the pituitary gland, plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of male reproductive tissues such as the testes and the prostate. In the early stages of a male fetus's development, testosterone aids in the formation of male genitalia. In puberty, this hormone is responsible for the deepening of the voice, the growth of muscle mass, and the appearance of body and facial hair. Throughout adulthood, it also maintains a man's libido and sperm production. During the gestation period, testosterone aids in the masculinization of the brain. By morphing the primitive gonadal tissues into male genitalia, it enables the development of the penis and scrotum. Furthermore, it influences aggressive behaviors and promotes muscle mass, helping boys become more physically active. In adulthood, though the production of testosterone gradually slows down, it continues to affect the brain, muscles, bones, and fat metabolism, maintaining a man's vitality and sexual function. On the other hand, the abbreviation pDA, or Personal Digital Assistant, refers to a handheld device that combines computing, internet, fax, and telephony features. A pDA may consist of a pen, a touch screen, an appointment calendar, an address book, and other features found in standard desktop PCs, but it is not in any way associated with the function or development of reproductive tissues. So, based on the given choices, the right answer should be (B), \\"No\\".

Q:The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New... what did trump probably wear while doing his speech Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. a white shirt B. a black suit C. not enough information D. a red tie A:","completion":"C. not enough information"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Review: The film was shot at Movie Flats, just off route 395, near Lone Pine, California, north of the road to Whitney Portals. You can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built. And you'll recognize the area from any Randolph Scott movie. I won't bother with the plot, since I'm sure it's covered elsewhere. The movie stars three athletes -- Fairbanks fils, who must have learned a good deal from his Dad -- Grant, an acrobat in his youth -- and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. Their physical skills are all on display. Not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously. It's about Thugees, a sect in India, whence our English word \\"thug.\\" I can't go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director, George Stevens, was a polymath with a background in Laurel and Hardy movies -- see his choreography of the fight scenes -- and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of Shane and The Diary of Anne Frank. Dynasties rose and fell. Geological epochs came and went, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed in \\"A Place in the Sun.\\" Here, in his comic mode, he excels. This is a story of male bonding and it would be easy -- too easy -- to read homoeroticism into it, as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or hatred of women. But it isn't that at all. Sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention. Men WILL form bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, nobody's idea of an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. For most of human history -- about nine tenths of it -- hominids have been hunters and gatherers, and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather. Hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. Men who were not very good at bonding were Darwinianed out, leaving men who have a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks, and MacLaughlin have got it in spades. Sorry to ramble on about evolution but I'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. Did I ever tell you about the horse in Vaitongi, Samoa, that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me? You've got to watch the hooves. Joan Fontaine is lovely, really. Only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister, Olivia DeHavilland, grew up and went to a convent school.

The diet can be hard to stick to once he begins to crave junk food and sweets, but Berto says he has found the perfect fix to help him resist unhealthy temptations. \\"When I'm in training camp and I can't eat what I want to eat, I watch the Food Network all day long,\\" he says. \\"I love watching and my new favorite show is From girls scaling the side of hotel buildings to people hiding out in his house, Berto admits being in the spotlight exposes him to some crazy situations. \\"Things start to get a little nuts,\\" he says. \\"It come with the territory, but its something you just can't let drive you crazy.\\" Despite the constant media craze around him, he's learned not to the let the rumor mill affect him. \\"It'll be just me having some party at my crib and have a few celebrities there, you know it ends up in the [tabloids] and they flip the story around and write it about us having drug parties or sex parties. It's not true,\\" he said. \\"You just have to be careful.\\" When he isn't in the ring, Berto like to spend his downtime jet-setting. \\"I like to see what else is out there and just enjoy life,\\" he says. The boxer has already checked a couple destination spots off of his bucket list, including France, Brazil and St. Barths. But perhaps his favorite travel spot of all time: a small island off the coast of the Philippines called Boracay. \\"I had the best time there,\\" he says. \\"They have the prettiest beaches I've ever seen.\\" After an earthquake devastated his parents' native Haiti and he lost several family members due to the devastation, Berto created The Berto Dynasty Foundation.

Why are designers and engineers unable to get reliable parts ?","completion":"The given information does not explicitly specify why designers and engineers are unable to get reliable parts. However, using the information given and general knowledge about the automotive industry, the following are possible reasons that can be deduced: 1. Supply Chain Disruptions: With the shifting of focus on design projects and the disruptions in the industry due to unexpected changes as stated, there could be potential issues with suppliers that deliver parts. This might lead to unreliable supply of parts. This is extrapolated from the fact that General Motors is cancelling or delaying certain projects, implying potential restructuring or change of plan that could affect their supply chain. 2. Change in Focus: If resources are being shifted towards certain projects, specifically smaller vehicles instead of pickups and SUVs, the diversity and quality of parts for the latter could be affected. Not all parts are suitable for all types of vehicles, creating an imbalance in parts availability. 3. Geographic Limitations: With design work now being shared across continents, there may be logistics challenges in procuring and delivering parts reliably. Although data sharing tools make communication easier, they don't physically transport parts, and this discrepancy might lead to difficulties in obtaining reliable parts. Again, these possible reasons are speculative based on the information given; without specific information on the aspects causing the unreliability in parts supply, this analysis might not fully cover the scope of the problem."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Jeremy is studying the periodic table in preparation for a chemistry test next week.

Summarize this article: The 27 governments - collectively called the Council - wanted to limit the pay rise to 1.85% because of tough economic conditions in Europe. The European Court of Justice says the Council \\"exceeded its powers\\" when it decided on the 1.85% figure. The court case, affecting about 45,000 EU staff, began in January. \\"The articles of the [Council] regulation that fix new amounts for salaries are annulled,\\" the court ruling said on Wednesday. Under the rules, staff salary adjustments take effect on 1 July, so the pay increase will have to be backdated. The move will still require a new Council regulation in line with the court ruling. The green light for the higher EU pay rise comes as national civil services are shedding jobs and freezing or cutting staff pay. The pay settlement for 2009-2010 was based on 2008 figures, reflecting economic conditions that were much better at the time. A complicated formula is used, based on civil service pay in eight of the EU's richer countries and on the cost of living in Brussels. The eight reference countries account for 76% of the EU's total GDP. The judges, who are also on the EU payroll, said the Council's only legal option to adjust EU salaries because of an economic downturn was under an exceptional clause in the regulations - but the Council had not taken that route. The Commission would have had to agree to such a move anyway. The Commission - the EU's executive arm - drafts laws and acts as guardian of the treaties. The court, whose rulings are binding on member states, sits in Luxembourg. Basic gross monthly salaries for Commission staff currently range from about 2,600 euros (Â£2,211) for a secretary to about 18,000 euros (Â£15,300) for a head of department, and about 20,000 euros for a commissioner. The special Community tax paid by EU staff is generally lower than national rates of income tax for civil servants. EU staff in Brussels and Luxembourg also get a wide range of allowances, including a residence allowance equivalent to 15% of their basic salary. Family-related allowances include a household allowance, a dependant child allowance, an educational allowance and a pre-school allowance. The Commission said it was satisfied with the court's decision, which was in line with the agreed method of salary adjustment. A Commission spokesman, Michael Mann, told the BBC that for 2010-2011 the salary calculation indicated a 2% cut in purchasing power for EU staff in Brussels, to match an equivalent cut in civil servants' salaries in the eight EU reference countries. So to keep pace with the 2.4% inflation rate in Brussels the EU pay increase for 2010-2011 would have to be 0.4%, he said. Since 2004 EU salaries have lost 5.3% of their purchasing power, he said. Summary:","completion":"The European Court of Justice has ruled that EU staff should receive a pay rise of around 3.7% for 2009-2010, despite efforts by the council representing the 27 EU governments to limit the increase to 1.85% due to tough economic conditions. The Council is said to have \\"exceeded its powers\\" when deciding upon the lower percentage. The court's decision affects approximately 45,000 EU staff, and the pay increase needs to be backdated to 1 July on which they take effect. The pay settlement for 2009-2010 was based on 2008 figures when economic conditions were notably better.

Article:Suspect Dylann Roof, 21, is due to make his first court appearance on Friday. Police are treating the killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday night in South Carolina as a hate crime. He was arrested the following day more than 200 miles away in North Carolina and then flown back to Charleston. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has said Mr Roof should face execution. \\"We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty,\\" she told NBC News. Mr Roof's first court hearing is set for 14:00 local time (18:00 GMT), but it is likely he will appear via a video feed and not in person. The victims of the shooting, which took place during a bible study group, included the pastor. Mr Roof reportedly sat with them for nearly an hour before pulling out his handgun and perpetrating the massacre. One survivor recalled him saying: \\"You all rape women and you're taking over our country.\\" President Barack Obama described the event as yet another tragedy caused by guns in society. His wife Michelle, who is travelling in Italy, said: \\"I pray for a community that I know is in pain with the hope that tragedies like these will one day come to an end.\\" The city's mayor Joseph Riley called the massacre an act of \\"pure, pure concentrated evil\\". He said that while the community had faced challenges, nothing in the past century matched this shooting. The victims of the Charleston shooting After the shooting, Mr Roof was arrested in Shelby when police received a tip from a florist who noticed his distinctive haircut. \\"I saw the pictures of him with the bowl cut. I said, 'I've seen that car for some reason.' I look over, and it's got a South Carolina tag on it,\\" florist Debbie Dills told the Shelby Star. She followed Mr Roof for 25 miles until police made the arrest. More details have been emerging about the 21-year-old, with one acquaintance saying he had complained that \\"blacks were taking over the world\\". Joey Meek said that he and Mr Roof got drunk a few weeks ago, and his friend said \\"someone needed to do something about it for the white race\\". When Roof was identified as the suspect, a photo emerged showing him standing in a wooded area wearing a jacketed emblazoned with flags from apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia - now black-led Zimbabwe. Whether Mr Roof had a connection to any of the 16 white supremacist organisations that operate in South Carolina is not clear. However, the massacre in one of the nation's oldest and most prominent traditionally black churches has served as a reminder that black churches have long been a target for violence throughout the history of US race relations.

The first statement is about a person on a skateboard who is in the air performing a skateboarding trick. This statement provides information about a specific scenario involving a skateboarder. Skateboarding is an action sport that primarily involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard. The second statement is about a skier going down a slope. This statement discusses a different individual participating in a different sport, skiing. Skiing is a winter sport that involves sliding downhill on snow-covered slopes using skis with fixed bindings to boots. Skiers navigate through different types of terrains and snow conditions while skiing down slopes or across flat terrain. Although both skateboarding and skiing are categorized as action sports, they are still distinctly different from each other – they involve different skill sets, are generally performed in different environments, and use different types of equipment.

Summarize this article: Protect yourself from disease and parasites, as well as the sharp beaks and talons of the bird by using gloves. You should also wash your hands before and after handling the bird, even if you are wearing gloves. If the bird’s nest is clearly destroyed but the bird’s parents are close by, you can create a simple hanging nest for the birds. Use a small basket or a small tupperware container. Punch or cut holes on the bottom of the container and line the container with paper towels. Hang the nest with duct tape to a branch near the old nest. Place the baby bird in the hanging nest. The parent should then locate the new nest and the baby bird. It is important that you do not put the baby bird back in the original nest if it is injured and its parents are missing, as the nest may contain parasites that could weaken the bird further. Instead, build a temporary nest for the bird using a small plastic bowl or a berry box. You should line the bowl with unscented paper towel to provide some cushioning for the bird. Avoid using a wire cage as the wire can injure the bird’s delicate feathers. If you do not have access to a plastic bowl, you can use a paper bag with air holes. This will keep the bird warm and protect it when it is in the temporary nest. If the bird is shivering, you can warm it up by putting one end of the cardboard box on a heating pad set to low. You can also fill a hot water bottle and place it next to the bird in the bowl. Make sure the bottle does not touch the bird, as this could burn it, or leak, as this could chill the bird even further. Once you place the bird in the lined plastic bowl, you can put the bowl in a cardboard box and tape the box shut. Put the box in a spare room or a bathroom away from pets and children. Noise can be very stressful for the bird so make sure all radios and televisions are turned off. You should limit your contact with the baby bird so you do not make its injury or illness worse. Make sure the baby bird’s legs are tucked underneath its body, not stretched out. Every species of bird requires a specific diet, so avoid making the bird more ill or weak by giving it food it should not eat. When a bird is injured, it will use all its energy to fight shock and the injury so do not force it to devote its energy to eating as well. You should also avoid giving the bird water, as it can potentially drown the bird. If you touch the bird, you should wash your hands well to prevent the transfer of any diseases or parasites. You should also wash any items the bird was in contact with, like towels, blankets or jackets.","completion":"The article highlights the importance of protecting oneself and the bird while handling an injured or displaced baby bird. To ensure safety, it is crucial to wear gloves and wash hands before and after handling the bird. If the bird's nest is destroyed but its parents are nearby, creating a makeshift hanging nest using a small basket or tupperware container with holes at the bottom and lined with paper towels is advised. The hanging nest should be placed near the original nest with the baby bird inside, allowing the parents to locate and care for their offspring. In the case of an injured bird or missing parents, it is essential not to place the baby bird back in the original nest to avoid infection from potential parasites. Instead, one should build a temporary nest using a small plastic bowl or berry box, lined with unscented paper towels for cushioning. Wire cages should be avoided, as they can damage the bird's delicate feathers. If a plastic bowl is unavailable, a paper bag with air holes can be used. Warming up the bird may be necessary if it is shivering, but one must be cautious not to burn or chill it further accidentally. Once the bird is placed in the lined plastic bowl, it can then be put in a cardboard box, taped shut, and kept in a quiet room away from pets and children. Limiting contact with the baby bird is essential to avoid worsening its condition. Properly tucking the bird's legs underneath its body is crucial, and providing species-specific diet is necessary to ensure its health and well-being. While handling the bird, one should also avoid giving it water to prevent drowning and wash hands thoroughly afterward to minimize the risk of disease or parasite transmission. Lastly, all items the bird was in contact with should also be cleaned to maintain hygiene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Title: Voice Recorder Review: This is a pretty good product but it is very chep I like it a lot better then most voice recorders I'veTried Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","completion":"The given product review primarily conveys a positive sentiment towards the voice recorder. The positivity comes from phrases such as \\"This is a pretty good product\\" and \\"I like it a lot better than most voice recorders I've tried.\\" These expressions show that the reviewer has had a positive experience with the product, framing it as superior in their experience when compared to other voice recorders they have used before. However, the mention of the product being \\"very chep\\", which we might assume is a typo meant to convey 'cheap', can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, if it was used to denote the affordability of the voice recorder, it could be seen as further positivity. A lot of buyers regard affordability as an essential factor, and 'cheap' in this context adds value to the product. On the other hand, 'cheap' might be used to represent a lack in the product's quality. Still, there's no additional text supporting this interpretation, such as stating the product malfunctioned or felt fragile, which might indicate the reviewer thought the device was made up of cheap components. Since the reviewer ends on a positive note, the 'cheap' reference seems less likely to be hinting at negative aspects. In ambiguous cases like this, it's vital to look at the review in its entirety. Here, the overall sentiment appears to be positive, without specific negative issues being raised. Taken as a whole, the review does raise questions about the build quality of the product due to its low cost, but these are secondary to the generally positive remarks about the device's performance. Therefore, the sentiment expressed in this product review leans more towards positivity, with the reviewer expressing their satisfaction with the voice recorder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson (May 25, 1878 - November 25, 1949) was an American tap dancer and actor, the best known and most highly paid African-American entertainer in the first half of the twentieth century. His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. The idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in The Little Colonel was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later: Robinson walked a step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he shortened his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. \\"Can I call you Uncle Billy?\\" I asked. \\"Why sure you can\\", he replied... \\"But then I get to call you darlin.'\\" It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his \\"darlin.'\\" Temple had already appeared in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film. Robinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the south along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Just Around the Corner. Robinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview \\"Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all.\\"","completion":"This text is about Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, an African-American tap dancer and actor who was very famous and well-paid during the first half of the twentieth century.

After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them to do this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa pursue their own agenda in secret. They develop a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. The hybrid subsequently becomes aggressive and stings Elsa several times. The hybrid sheds body parts in an effort to escape when they try to destroy her, but they subdue her. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child.

Passage 1:Ole Miss's 2015 season began with easy victories over FCS foe UT-Martin and the Mountain West's Fresno State, and continued their momentum by defeating then-no.2 Alabama on the road, which would become the signature victory of the Rebels' 2015 campaign. Ole Miss then rose to no.3 in the AP Poll, and although they were heavy favorites in their next matchup against Vanderbilt, they struggled mightily, but ultimately emerged victorious. They Rebels maintained their no.3 ranking before getting blown out by Florida on the road and fell to no.14 before bouncing back against New Mexico State. The Rebels entered their next game with a #13 ranking against rival Memphis, in what was one of the most anticipated in the history of Memphis football. Ole Miss, despite being double digit favorites, lost by 13 points, causing them to fall 11 spots in the rankings to no.24. The Rebels followed with two wins against SEC West opponents Texas A&M and Auburn and climbed to no.18 in the rankings and controlled their own destiny the SEC West, but a heartbreaking loss to Arkansas the following week caused them to fall to second place in the SEC West and to fall out of the rankings for the first time since the 2013 season. However, Ole Miss finished the regular season with double digit wins over ranked SEC Rivals LSU and Mississippi State and rose to no.12 in the College Football Playoff poll, which earned them a Sugar Bowl berth for the first time since 1970, where they defeated no.16 Oklahoma State and ultimately finished ranked no.10 in the AP Poll, their first top-ten finish since 1969.

Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. and the situation: Molly has just moved to a new city for a job she was just hired for.

Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries. - Don Priestley (born 1940) is a video game programmer who wrote for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1982 and 1989. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices.

Step 1: Examine the first sentence. \\"The issue isn't how much violence.\\" This sentence suggests that the main concern is not the amount or degree of violence involved. Step 2: Examine the second sentence. \\"It has nothing to do with violence.\\" This sentence claims that the subject being discussed is entirely unrelated to violence. Step 3: Compare the two sentences. Both sentences agree that the primary focus is not on the level of violence. However, they differ in their relationship to violence. The first sentence implies that there is still a connection to violence, even if it's not the crux of the issue. The second sentence, on the other hand, completely denies any association with violence. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true.

The section whose liquid crystalline range corresponds to the temperature of the body becomes translucent (here shown in green), indicating the temperature. We also see the effect of liquid crystals in nature. Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up their external skeletons, not because of light absorption from their pigment. The cells form helices with a structure like those found in cholesteric liquid crystals. When the pitch of the helix is close to the wavelength of visible light, the cells reflect light with wavelengths that lead to brilliant metallic colors. Because a color change occurs depending on a person’s angle of view, researchers in New Zealand are studying the beetles to develop a thin material that can be used as a currency security measure. The automobile industry is also interested in exploring such materials for use in paints that would change color at different viewing angles. With only molecular structure as a guide, one cannot precisely predict which of the various liquid crystalline phases a given compound will actually form. One can, however, identify molecules containing the kinds of structural features that tend to result in liquid crystalline behavior, as demonstrated in Example 11.

Following the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst its saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing its new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. Meteora features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003 and instantly earned worldwide recognition, going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia. Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album's singles, including \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Breaking the Habit\\", \\"Faint\\", and \\"Numb\\", received significant radio attention. By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three million copies. The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year and Pia. Meteora earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and the Viewer's Choice Award for \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year (\\"Numb\\") awards. Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid Theory, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts. At the same time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust and financial issues.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: 16 Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance Charles Darwin1 , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits arise. As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be DNA2 , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a million matches out of sequence. However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order differently than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of a mutation. These changes in DNA sequences are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest difference in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the example of Sickle cell anemia3 is commonly given as its origin is a difference of only one base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells. Individual sequences of DNA that encode for specific proteins are called genes and are the units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide4 , and together all of the genes (and some sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions) together make up the entire chromosome5.

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt.

Article: I was an only child up until the age of eight.Every time I saw other girls playing or sharing their secrets with their sisters or brothers,I would feel sad for myself .At Christmas I found out that I was soon to be a big sister.I had no idea how I would deal with a baby in our house.The little experience I had with kids taught me that I didn't really like them.They were always making trouble. My parents set off to the hospital one evening and planned to have the rest of my family and I come to the hospital later .To this day, I don't think I have gone through a more nerve-wracking experience than sitting in the hospital's waiting room.I was sleepless all night .When I was finally allowed to see my new baby sister , I was so scared.I reached out and when I got a hold of her,I fell in love with her.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Wayne Gretzky is an ice hockey god to millions of Canadians but even the \\"Great One\\" is unable to offer a solution to the labor dispute now threatening to wipe out the entire NHL season.","completion":"The given information talks about Wayne Gretzky, an iconic Canadian ice hockey player, and how he finds himself incapable of resolving the ongoing labor dispute threatening to abolish the NHL (National Hockey League) season. Wayne Gretzky, often called the \\"Great One\\", is considered a hockey deity by countless Canadians. He's revered not only in Canada but internationally for his phenomenal contribution to the sport of ice hockey. Gretzky, throughout his professional career, has set numerous records and won multiple awards, placing him among the greatest players the sport has ever seen. His status alone brings tremendous influence and respect. However, the details hint at a labor dispute that is posing a significant threat to the NHL season. The term \\"labor dispute\\" generally refers to disagreement or conflict between the management (typically the owners) and the employees (in this case, the players and other personnel associated with the teams). These disputes can arise due to a myriad of reasons, from disagreements over contract terms and wages to disputes over health and safety regulations. Evidently, in this scenario, the dispute has escalated to a level where it could potentially lead to the cancellation of the entire NHL season. This would be a tremendous blow not only to the players and other involved parties but also to the legions of fans who passionately follow the season. Despite his legendary status in the sport, Gretzky seems unable to find a solution to this labor dispute. This could be due to a number of reasons. Firstly, as an individual, even someone as influential as Gretzky may not hold the necessary power or authority to mediate between the management and players or to influence decisions at a league level. More often than not, these disputes require negotiation and compromise from both parties involved, which can be a complex and drawn out process. Moreover, the nature and extent of these labor disputes can be quite intricate and convoluted, involving legal and contractual aspects that are far removed from the realm of a player's usual responsibilities or expertise. Even for someone with Gretzky's authority and knowledge in the hockey world, such disputes can pose a significant challenge. In conclusion, the provided information sheds light on a critical labor dispute threatening to cancel the NHL season. Despite the presence of hockey legends like Wayne Gretzky, the resolution of such issues is uncertain, mainly because they don't rest on a player's prowess on the ice or their status in the sport, but rather more complex factors such as contractual obligations, finance, and labor rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Baen Books is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf. - Baen Ebooks is an e-book supplier operated by Baen Books. It sells e-books for Baen and some other publishers, as well as hosting the Baen Free Library. Unlike most e-book suppliers, it does not use Digital Rights Management (i.e., copy protection). Purchasers can download the same e-book in seven different formats (BBeB, EPUB, HTML, Microsoft Reader Mobipocket, Rocketbook, and RTF), even long after the initial purchase. Their range of genres offered is heavy on science fiction and fantasy. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Baen Free Library is a digital library of the science fiction and fantasy publishing house Baen Books where 61 e-books as of June 2016 (112 e-books as of December 2008) can be downloaded free in a number of formats, without copy protection. It was founded in late 1999 by science fiction writer Eric Flint and publisher Jim Baen to determine whether the availability of books free of charge on the Internet encourages or discourages the sale of their paper books. - Electronic publishing (also referred to as e-publishing or digital publishing or online publishing) includes the digital publication of e-books, digital magazines, and the development of digital libraries and catalogues. Electronic publishing has become common in scientific publishing where it has been argued that peer-reviewed scientific journals are in the process of being replaced by electronic publishing. It is also becoming common to distribute books, magazines, and newspapers to consumers through tablet reading devices, a market that is growing by millions each year, generated by online vendors such as Apple's iTunes bookstore, Amazon's bookstore for Kindle, and books in the Google Play Bookstore. Market research suggests that half of all magazine and newspaper circulation will be via digital delivery by the end of 2015 and that half of all reading in the United States will be done without paper by 2015. - James Patrick \\"Jim\\" Baen (| ben |; October 22, 1943 June 28, 2006) was a U.S. science fiction publisher and editor. In 1983, he founded his own publishing house, Baen Books, specializing in the adventure, fantasy, military science fiction, and space opera genres. Baen also founded the video game publisher, Baen Software. In late 1999, he started an electronic publishing business called Webscriptions (since renamed to Baen Ebooks), which is considered to be the first profitable e-book vendor. - Fallen Angels ( 1991 ) ( ISBN 0 - 7434 - 3582 - 6 ) is a Prometheus Award - winning novel by science fiction authors Larry Niven , Jerry Pournelle , and Michael Flynn published by Jim Baen . The novel was written as a tribute to science fiction fandom , and includes many of its well - known figures , legends , and practices . It also champions modern technology and heaps scorn upon its critics - budget cutting politicians , fringe environmentalists and the forces of ignorance . An ebook of this text was among the first released by the Baen Free Library . The novel takes aim at several targets of ridicule : Senator William Proxmire , radical environmentalists and mystics , such as one character who believes that one can not freeze to death in the snow because ice is a crystal and \`\` crystals are healing . '' It also mocks ignorance in journalism , which greatly helps the main characters ( for example , one \`\` expert '' cited in a news article believes that the astronauts must have superhuman strength , based on a photograph of a weightless astronaut easily handling heavy construction equipment ) and the non-scientific world in general . Several real people are tuckerized into the book in a more positive light , including many fans who made donations to charity for that express purpose and a character called \`\` RMS '' ( presumably Richard M. Stallman ) who leads a network of hackers called the Legion of Doom , connected by a series of BBS systems . - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.

To elaborate, let's analyze the information provided in the premise and how it relates to the hypothesis. Premise details: 1. A man and woman are present. 2. They are drinking beer. 3. The setting is outdoors. 4. The time is at night. Hypothesis details: 1. They are enjoying cold beverages. Premise to hypothesis correlation: - Beer is a common cold beverage, so it can be considered a cold beverage in this context. Given that the man and woman are outdoors and drinking beer, it seems reasonable to conclude that they are enjoying cold beverages. This is because the premise states they are actively drinking beer, which is typically served and enjoyed cold. Additionally, they are outdoors at night, possibly enhancing the pleasurable experience of consuming cold beverages in a relaxed setting. Although the given hypothesis does not explicitly mention the presence of a man and woman or that it is night time, the premise provides enough information to support the hypothesis by describing the individuals present and their beverage consumption.

Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - A mill race, millrace or millrun is the current of water that turns a water wheel, or the channel (sluice) conducting water to or from a water wheel. Compared to the broad waters of a mill pond, the narrow current is swift and powerful. The race leading to the water wheel on a wide stream or mill pond is called the head race (or headrace), and the race leading away from the wheel is called the tail race (or tailrace). - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A body of water or waterbody (often spelled water body) is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface. The term most often refers to oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water. - Sonoma County is a county in the U.S. state of California. As of the 2010 United States Census, its population was 483,878. Its county seat and largest city is Santa Rosa. It is located to the north of Marin County and the south of Mendocino County. It is west of Napa County and Lake County. - In hillslope geomorphology, a rill is a shallow channel (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into soil by the erosive action of flowing water. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as gullies. - In usage in the United States, a bayou (or , from Cajun French) is a body of water typically found in a flat, low-lying area, and can be either an extremely slow-moving stream or river (often with a poorly defined shoreline), or a marshy lake or wetland.

Given the question: Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine. Question: suppose A balance in nutrition is made happens, how will it affect more food will be digested. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More effect. A balanced nutrition plays a significant role in improving the efficiency of the digestive process. When a person consumes a well-balanced diet comprised of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, the different steps in the digestive process work optimally, and likely result in more food being digested. To understand the impact of balanced nutrition on the digestive process, let's examine each stage mentioned in the question: 1. Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach: When a person consumes food that is easy to break down and combines various nutrients, it simplifies the transit of the food bolus from the esophagus to the stomach. A proper balance of nutrition ensures that there are no obstructive factors like excessive solid food particles that could impede this passage. 2. The stomach churns the food: The stomach muscles' contractions help mix and break down food particles. Balanced nutrition ensures that the stomach's muscles have enough energy to perform this process efficiently. Additionally, better quality nutrients are more likely to be processed faster. 3. With the aid of stomach acids: Balanced nutrition aids in maintaining the correct pH levels in the stomach, which is essential for optimal functionality of digestive enzymes and acids. When the stomach retains appropriate acidity, it helps break down food faster and more effectively. 4. The food becomes a thick liquid: A balanced diet supports proper breakdown and mixing of food particles in the stomach, which turns into a semi-liquid substance called chyme. This substance can be easily passed along the gastrointestinal tract for further absorption and processing. 5. The chyme is then passed to the small intestine: A well-balanced diet improves the motility of the gastrointestinal tract and facilitates the passage of chyme from the stomach to the small intestine. Moreover, balanced nutrition delivers the necessary vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants required to maintain a healthy gut lining, preventing inflammation and damage. In summary, a balanced diet directly influences the second effect mentioned - the stomach churning food - by ensuring that the muscular contractions are efficient, promoting the optimal breakdown of food particles, and maintaining appropriate pH levels for enzymes and acids to function effectively. As a result, these factors lead to more food being digested effectively and a better overall digestive process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Born on November 19, 1917, as Indira Nehru, she later took on her husband's last name, Gandhi. She was the daughter of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and became an influential political figure in the Indian political landscape even before her tenure as the Prime Minister. Indira Gandhi first became the Prime Minister of India on January 24, 1966, following the untimely demise of Lal Bahadur Shastri on January 11, 1966. Shastri had succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru after his death in 1964, but his own term was relatively short, spanning only 19 months. Shastri was deeply involved in advocating for social and economic reforms and played a pivotal role in India's victory in the 1965 Indo-Pak War. As the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi held the position for two non-consecutive terms: from January 24, 1966, to March 24, 1977, and later from January 14, 1980, until her assassination on October 31, 1984. During her tenure, Indira Gandhi led the nation through significant domestic and international challenges and left an indelible mark on Indian politics and history. Throughout her political career, Indira Gandhi focused on numerous key issues such as poverty alleviation, economic growth, and agricultural reforms. She nationalized various industries and banks, pursued socialist policies, and implemented land reforms to provide assistance to the poor. She also took significant steps to reduce income disparities, establish self-sufficiency in food production, and improve India's position in international relations. Among the most notable events during her tenure were the Green Revolution, the 1971 Indo-Pak War that led to the creation of Bangladesh, and the declaration of a controversial 21-month state of emergency in India from 1975 to 1977. Indira Gandhi's assassination in 1984 marked the end of an era in Indian politics.

Share your story. Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Panicked crowds pushed toward the exits as fire swept through a packed nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday. Hundreds didn't escape in time. The blaze at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria killed at least 233 people, Brazilian Health Minister Alexandro Padilha told reporters. Many of them apparently died from smoke inhalation, state-run Agencia Brasil reported. Others were trampled in the rush for the exits, one security guard told CNN affiliate Band News. More than 90 people were hospitalized, Padilha said, including 14 patients with severe burns. Deadly blazes: Nightclub tragedies in recent history About 2,000 people were inside the club when the fire broke out -- double the maximum capacity of 1,000, said Guido de Melo, a state fire official. Investigators have received preliminary information that security guards stopped people from exiting the club, he told Globo TV. \\"This overcrowding made it difficult for people to leave, and according to the information we have, the security guards kept people from leaving the building,\\" he said. The fire started \\"from out of nowhere\\" on a stage at the club and quickly spread to the ceiling, witness Jairo Vieira told Band News. \\"People started running,\\" survivor Luana Santos Silva told Globo TV. \\"I fell on the floor.\\" There was a pyrotechnics show going on inside the club when the fire started. Authorities stopped short of blaming it for the blaze, saying the cause was still under investigation. Video from the scene showed firefighters shooting streams of water at the club and shirtless men trying to break down a wall with axes. Smoke billowed outside the front of the building as the stench of fire filled the air, said Max Muller, who was riding by on his motorbike when he saw the blaze. Muller recorded video of a chaotic scene outside the club, which showed emergency crews tending to victims and dazed clubgoers standing in the street. Bodies lay on the ground beside ambulances. Friends who were inside the club told him that many struggled to find the exits in the dark. Muller, who was not inside the club Sunday morning but has been there twice before, said there were no exit signs over the doors. It is rare to see such signs in Brazilian clubs. Valderci Oliveira, a state lawmaker, told Band News that he saw piles of bodies in the club's bathroom when he arrived at the scene hours after the blaze. It looked \\"like a war zone,\\" he said. Read more: How to protect yourself in a crowd Police told Band News that 90% of the victims were found in that part of the club. Shoes and cell phones were strewn on the ground in the charred rubble of the club Sunday, said Glauber Fernandes, a reporter from Band News. \\"While we were there we saw the cell phones ringing. Parents, friends, trying to know about what was happening,\\" he said. \\"No one was answering.\\" The roof collapsed in several parts of the building, Fernandes said, trapping many inside. Desperate families and friends wept as they searched for information outside a local gymnasium where bodies were taken for identification later Sunday. Inside, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff met with some of them as they waited on bleachers for word of their loved ones. Rousseff became teary-eyed as she spoke of the fire to reporters in Chile earlier Sunday. She had been attending a regional summit there, but cut short the trip and returned to Brazil early to deal with the aftermath of the tragedy. \\"The Brazilian people are the ones who need me today,\\" she said. \\"I want to tell the people of Santa Maria in this time of sadness that we are all together.\\" An accordionist who had been performing onstage with a band when the fire broke out was among the dead, drummer Eliel de Lima told Globo. The fire started around 2 a.m. after the acoustic insulation in the Kiss nightclub caught fire, said Col. Adilomar Silva, the regional coordinator of civil defense. Police were interviewing witnesses as part of an investigation into what caused the blaze, state-run Agencia Brasil reported. \\"There just weren't enough emergency exits,\\" Mateus Vargas, a witness who was inside the club when the fire broke out, told Band News. The club's license had expired in August and had not been renewed, local fire official Moises da Silva Fuchs told Globo TV. The incident called to mind a 2003 nightclub fire in Rhode Island where pyrotechnics used by the heavy metal band Great White ignited a blaze that killed 100 people. Pyrotechnics were also involved in a 2004 nightclub fire in Argentina that killed 194 people and a 2009 explosion at a nightclub in Russia that left more than 100 dead. The Kiss nightclub is popular with young people in Santa Maria, drawing between 2,000 and 3,000 people a night on the weekends. The blaze broke out during a weekend when students were celebrating the end of summer. Students at many Brazilian universities return to school on Monday. Santa Maria is home to the Federal University of Santa Maria as well as a number of other private universities and colleges. Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Context: But corrected figures, provided by the U.S. military and published Tuesday by SIGAR, suggest that the actual decline was 17,980. Pentagon officials acknowledged originally providing inaccurate figures to SIGAR because of a failure \\"to account for the transfer of most of the Afghan Border Force from the Afghan National Police to the Afghan National Army,\\" according to a SIGAR statement. According to the new figures, there were 313,728 members of the Afghan defense forces as of January 31, 2018. That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported. \\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\\" the statement added. The new figures still amount to a sharp decline. Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified. Senior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August. Those success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. But the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says. Trump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely. It involves pressuring Pakistan to end its support for Afghan militants, supporting Kabul's effort to engage the Taliban in peace talks, and dropping more bombs on the country. The U.S.-led...

It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Write a text based on \\"nato escorts shipload of supplies to somalia\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Aiding Somalia: NATO Escorts Shipload of Vital Supplies to the Crisis-Stricken Nation Introduction: In a show of international support and cooperation, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has recently taken on the crucial responsibility of escorting a massive shipload of supplies destined for the conflict-ridden nation of Somalia. With the ongoing political turmoil and humanitarian crisis that plagues the African country, this timely act of solidarity plays a significant role in alleviating the immense suffering faced by the Somali population. Background: Somalia, a country located on the Horn of Africa, has faced various challenges such as political instability, piracy threats, terrorism, and humanitarian crises in recent decades. The ongoing conflict involving the Somali government, rebel factions, and other extremist groups has caused a major disruption in everyday life, severely affecting the country's political, social, and economic landscape. Consequently, millions of Somalis are in dire need of food, clean water, medical supplies, and adequate shelter. The Role of NATO: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a potent military alliance comprising 30 member nations, was formed in 1949 to guarantee the safety and freedom of its members through political and military means. In recent years, NATO has extended its reach, taking on initiatives to foster peace and stability around the world. In the case of Somalia, NATO has been actively involved in combating piracy and promoting maritime security, which contributes to creating a more secure environment for the Somali people and the international community. The Escort Mission: Recognizing the urgency of supplying essential goods to the people of Somalia, NATO took the initiative of escorting a shipload carrying life-saving supplies to the beleaguered nation. The ship, laden with food, medical equipment, clean water, and shelter materials, embarked on its journey under the watchful eyes of NATO naval forces. This operation was meticulously planned to ensure the safe passage of the ship, as piracy and other security threats continue to be a major concern in the region. In addition to escorting the supply ship, NATO also worked closely with international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and Somali authorities to guarantee that the delivery of goods was conducted in an efficient and transparent manner. This collective effort aimed at minimizing corruption and ensuring that the aid reaches those who need it most. The Impact: NATO's successful escort mission had an immediate impact on the lives of millions of Somalis who have been struggling to survive amidst the ongoing crisis. The delivery of essential supplies like food and clean water has helped alleviate hunger and malnutrition, while the provision of medical supplies has allowed for better healthcare and a chance for a healthier future. Moreover, NATO's presence in the region sends a powerful message of support to the Somali government and its people, reaffirming a commitment to peace and stability. It also serves as a deterrent to piracy and other criminal activities, promoting a safer maritime environment for international trade and commerce. Conclusion: The successful escort of a shipload of vital supplies to Somalia by NATO not only highlights the alliance's dedication to humanitarian efforts but also signifies the importance of international cooperation in addressing global crises. By leveraging its military capabilities and diplomatic influence, NATO has made a tangible impact on the lives of millions of Somalis. Such acts of solidarity demonstrate the potential of collective action in addressing and resolving pressing global challenges, paving the way towards a more secure and prosperous future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Northern tribesmen took over Algarve\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was significant about the start of the fourth century until the mid fifth century?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Northern tribesmen took over Algarve\\" correctly answers the question \\"What was significant about the start of the fourth century until the mid-fifth century?\\" as the paragraph mentions, \\"Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century.\\" This period marked the transition of control in the Algarve region from the Romans to the Visigoths, representing a significant change in the region's rulers and their cultural influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"It is important to analyze the initial options provided as well as the question itself to ensure a thorough understanding before providing a comprehensive answer. The query consists of the following parts: 1. The initial answer options are \\"A) Yes\\" and \\"B) No.\\" 2. The main question asks if the correct answer to \\"which animal has a backbone?\\" is \\"snail.\\" 3. Additional information states that \\"all birds have backbones.\\" Now, let us examine the facts and logic involved in addressing this situation. The question asks whether the right answer to the query \\"which animal has a backbone?\\" is \\"snail.\\" To make a sound judgment, we need to determine if snails possess backbones. Snails belong to the phylum Mollusca and are invertebrates, which means they lack a backbone or spinal column. Therefore, snails do not have backbones. It is also mentioned that \\"all birds have backbones.\\" This information is accurate, as birds are vertebrates, animals that possess a backbone or spinal column. While this fact does not directly influence our answer, it can serve as a point of comparison when discussing backbones in various animal groups. Given our knowledge about snails and birds, we can determine that the appropriate answer to the question \\"which animal has a backbone?\\" should not be \\"snail.\\" Consequently, we can deduce that the correct response, according to the provided answer options, is: B) No. The right answer to the question \\"which animal has a backbone?\\" is not \\"snail,\\" as snails are invertebrates and lack a backbone or spinal column. Instead, an example of an animal with a backbone would be a bird or any other member of the vertebrate group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer this question: who killed tara in sons of anarchy season 6??","completion":"In Sons of Anarchy Season 6, Tara Knowles, played by Maggie Siff, is tragically killed in the season finale, episode 13, titled \\"A Mother's Work.\\" Tara is murdered by her mother-in-law and SAMCRO matriarch, Gemma Teller Morrow, who is portrayed by Katey Sagal. This shocking event occurs as a result of a series of misunderstandings and escalating tensions between Tara and the members of SAMCRO, including her husband Jax Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam). Tara is a doctor and the wife of Jax, making her an unlikely character to meet such a violent end in the world of Sons of Anarchy. However, her involvement with Jax and SAMCRO ultimately puts a target on her back. Throughout Season 6, Tara is grappling with her desire to protect her children from the violent lifestyle that surrounds the motorcycle club, even if it means distancing them from their father, Jax. This internal conflict and her mounting frustration with the club's illegal activities lead her to contemplate a difficult decision: she plans to testify against SAMCRO and provide crucial information to the district attorney for the RICO case against the club. She hopes that doing so will give her and her children a chance at a new life, far from the chaos and violence of the club. Gemma, unaware of these details, mistakenly believes that Tara has already betrayed Jax and the club by striking a deal with the authorities. In a professional yet personal act of revenge, Gemma seeks Tara out in her own home and brutally murders her with a carving fork. This gruesome killing is an emotionally charged and impulsive act that leaves both the characters and the audience reeling from the consequences. In the wake of Tara's murder, the remaining episodes and seasons of Sons of Anarchy explore the ripple effects of her death on the characters. Jax is left to grapple with feelings of grief, guilt, and vengeance as he seeks to secure a safe future for his children while also trying to avenge Tara's death. Gemma's violent actions also call into question the nature of family loyalty and the true cost of the outlaw lifestyle. In conclusion, Tara Knowles' tragic murder in Sons of Anarchy Season 6 was committed by her mother-in-law, Gemma Teller Morrow. This violent act served as a pivotal moment in the series, with lasting repercussions that shaped the trajectory of both individual characters and the overall narrative throughout the remaining seasons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - Mitanni (Hittite cuneiform Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the Levant of a distinct pottery type. - The Bronze Age is a period characterized by the use of bronze, proto-writing, and other early features of urban civilization. The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system, as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies. - The Hittites were an Ancient Anatolian people who established an empire centered on Hattusa in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under Suppiluliuma I, when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC the Hittite Empire came into conflict with the Egyptian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire and the empire of the Mitanni for control of the Near East. The Assyrians eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire, while the remainder was sacked by Phrygian newcomers to the region. After c. 1180 BC, during the Bronze Age collapse, the Hittites splintered into several independent \\"Neo-Hittite\\" city-states, some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Robert Gurney (31 July 1879 5 March 1950) was a British zoologist from the Gurney family, most famous for his monographs on \\"British Freshwater Copepoda\\" (19311933) and the \\"Larvae of Decapod Crustacea\\" (1942). He was not affiliated with any institution, but worked at home, initially in Norfolk, and later near Oxford. He travelled to North Africa and Bermuda, and received material from other foreign expeditions, including the \\"Terra Nova\\" Expedition (19101913) and the \\"Discovery Investigations\\" of the 1920s and 1930s. - Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is approximately east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; south of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia; and north of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The capital city is Hamilton. Bermuda is an associate member of CARICOM. - Norfolk is a county in East Anglia in England. It borders Lincolnshire to the west and north-west, Cambridgeshire to the west and southwest, and Suffolk to the south. Its northern and eastern boundaries are the North Sea and, to the north-west, The Wash. The county town is Norwich. - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - Near East is a geographical term that roughly encompasses Western Asia. Despite having varying definitions within different academic circles, the term was originally applied to the maximum extent of the Ottoman Empire. The term has fallen into disuse in English and has been replaced by the terms \\"Middle East\\" and \\"West Asia\\". - Oliver Robert Gurney ( 28 January 1911 -- 11 January 2001 ) was an English Assyriologist from the Gurney family and a leading scholar of the Hittites . - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - In antiquity, Phrygia was a kingdom in the west central part of Anatolia, in what is now Turkey, centered on the Sakarya River. - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. - The Discovery Investigations were a series of scientific cruises and shore-based investigations into the biology of whales in the Southern Ocean. They were funded by the British Colonial Office and organised by the Discovery Committee in London, which was formed in 1918. They were intended to provide the scientific background to stock management of the commercial Antarctic whale fishery. The work of the Investigations contributed hugely to our knowledge of the whales, the krill they fed on, and the oceanography of their habitat, while charting the local topography, including Atherton Peak. The investigations continued until 1951, with the final report being published in 1980. - Copepods (meaning \\"oar-feet\\") are a group of small crustaceans found in the sea and nearly every freshwater habitat. Some species are planktonic (drifting in sea waters), some are benthic (living on the ocean floor), and some continental species may live in limnoterrestrial habitats and other wet terrestrial places, such as swamps, under leaf fall in wet forests, bogs, springs, ephemeral ponds, and puddles, damp moss, or water-filled recesses (phytotelmata) of plants such as bromeliads and pitcher plants. Many live underground in marine and freshwater caves, sinkholes, or stream beds. Copepods are sometimes used as biodiversity indicators. - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - A monograph is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to reference works) on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, usually by a single author. - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - The Neo-Assyrian Empire was an Iron Age Mesopotamian empire, in existence between 911 and 612 BC. The Assyrians perfected early techniques of imperial rule, many of which became standard in later empires. Following the conquests of Adad-nirari II in the late 10th century BC, Assyria emerged as the most powerful state in the known world at the time, coming to dominate the Ancient Near East, East Mediterranean, Asia Minor, Caucasus, and parts of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa, eclipsing and conquering rivals such as Babylonia, Elam, Persia, Urartu, Lydia, the Medes, Phrygians, Cimmerians, Israel, Judah, Phoenicia, Chaldea, Canaan, the Kushite Empire, the Arabs, and Egypt. The Neo-Assyrian Empire succeeded the Old Assyrian Empire (C.2025-1750 BC), and the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1050 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. During this period, Aramaic was also made an official language of the empire, alongside the Akkadian language. - The Middle Assyrian Empire is the period in the history of Assyria between the fall of the Old Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BC and the establishment of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BC. - Upper Mesopotamia is the name used for the uplands and great outwash plain of northwestern Iraq, northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey, in the northern Middle East. This region (together with northeastern Iraq) is approximately correspondent with what was Assyria from the 25th century BC through to the mid-7th century AD. After the Arab Islamic conquest of the mid-7th century AD the region has been known by the traditional Arabic name of al-Jazira (\\"the island\\"), also transliterated \\"Djazirah\\", \\"Djezirah\\", \\"Jazirah\\", which derives from the earlier Syriac (Aramaic ) variant \\"Gazero\\". The Euphrates and Tigris rivers transform Mesopotamia into almost an island, as they are joined together at the Shatt al-Arab in the Basra Governorate of Iraq, and their sources in eastern Turkey are in close proximity. - Hattusa (Hittite: , \\"a-at-tu-ša\\", read \\"attuša\\") was the capital of the Hittite Empire in the late Bronze Age. Its ruins lie near modern Boazkale, Turkey, within the great loop of the Kzlrmak River (Hittite: \\"Marashantiya\\"; Greek: \\"Halys\\").

Stress since childhood caused bald patches on the right side of my scalp. How to undo it overtime naturally? How do female/male athletes manage their hair as regular washing can damage hair? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Possible answers: * no; * yes;","completion":"Question 1: Stress since childhood caused bald patches on the right side of my scalp. How to undo it overtime naturally? Addressing hair loss caused by long-term stress requires a holistic approach that includes stress management and natural hair care techniques. Here is a detailed plan to help you recover from stress-induced hair loss: 1. Manage stress: Reducing stress should be your primary focus. Practice stress management techniques like meditation, yoga, mindfulness, or regular exercise. Joining a support group or seeking professional help from a therapist may also be beneficial. 2. Nutrition and diet: A well-balanced diet, rich in vitamins and minerals, is essential for hair health. Consume foods rich in vitamins A, B, C, and E, as well as minerals like iron, zinc, and selenium. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your diet. 3. Scalp massage: Massaging your scalp regularly can help improve blood circulation and stimulate hair follicles, promoting hair growth. Use gentle circular motions to massage your scalp for 5-10 minutes every day, or consider using a scalp massager. 4. Essential oils: Some essential oils can be helpful in promoting hair growth and improving hair health. Dilute oils like rosemary, lavender, peppermint, or cedarwood in a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil, and gently massage it onto your scalp. Leave it on for at least an hour or overnight, then wash it off with a mild shampoo. 5. Hair care routine: Adopt a gentle hair care routine. Avoid harsh chemical treatments, tight hairstyles, and excessive heat styling. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and a nourishing conditioner that suits your hair type, and minimize brushing or combing your hair when wet to avoid breakage. 6. Supplements: Consider taking hair growth supplements like biotin, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, after consulting with your healthcare provider to ensure there are no contraindications. 7. Be patient: Hair growth takes time, and it may take several months to see improvement. Be consistent with your hair care practices and stress management, and give your body the time it needs to heal and regrow hair. Question 2: How do female/male athletes manage their hair as regular washing can damage hair? Athletes need to pay extra attention to their hair care due to the increased exposure to sweat, dirt, and other environmental elements. Here's how they can manage their hair without causing damage: 1. Rinse with water: If the hair isn't excessively dirty or oily, rinsing with plain water can help remove sweat and dirt, without having to use shampoo daily. 2. Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos: When shampooing is needed, choose a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo to avoid stripping the hair of its natural oils. Focus on the scalp and roots, as the shampoo will travel down the hair's length with rinsing. 3. Condition well: Apply a moisturizing conditioner to the mid-lengths and ends of hair after every shampoo. This helps keep hair hydrated and reduces the chances of breakage and split ends. 4. Go easy on heat styling: Limit the use of hot styling tools like hairdryers, straighteners, or curling irons. If using a hairdryer, use the lowest heat setting, and consider using a heat protectant spray. 5. Protect your hair: Keep hair off your face and free from damage with appropriate protective styles like braids, ponytails, and buns. Use fabric hair ties instead of rubber bands or elastic to prevent breakage. 6. Wear a swim cap: For swimmers, wearing a swim cap helps protect hair from harsh chemicals like chlorine, which can cause dryness and damage. 7. Regular trims: Keeping hair well-trimmed is crucial for healthy hair maintenance. Schedule regular trims to keep split ends and damage at bay. Answer to the last question: The two questions are not the same, as they address different issues. The first question focuses on recovery from stress-induced hair loss, while the second discusses hair care strategies for athletes. Consequently, the answer is no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Winston is chided by his wife Clemmie for their lack of money and is aware that as a 'man of destiny' his moment may have passed. At the same time he struggles in the House of Commons as a backbencher to get a hearing for his concerns about German re-armament under Hitler and the policy of appeasement. Churchill is also disappointed by the behaviour of his son Randolph Churchill (Tom Hiddleston), which leads to further arguments with Clemmie, who announces she is leaving to go on an extended overseas trip. Churchill is devastated and throws himself into his pet activities: painting, and building walls around the family house. Clemmie eventually returns, and the couple are reconciled. During the same period, a young official in the government, Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) has become concerned about the growth of the German Luftwaffe (air force), and is convinced by his wife to leak information about it to Churchill. Shortly afterwards, Churchill uses Wigram's information to launch an attack on the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). In 1936, Wigram commits suicide. With Churchill's fortunes restored, the narrative jumps forward to September 1939, with the declaration of war against Germany at the start of World War II, and the announcement that Churchill will be taking over command of the Royal Navy again as First Lord of the Admiralty.

In addition, a strange mutation has occurred in 10% of the population, giving them minor telekinetic powers, manifested by their ability to float small objects. They are referred to as TKs. Thirty years into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is immediately outlawed. However, because by that point tracking technology has rendered it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies secretly, crime bosses turn to time travel to send their targets to the past (the movie's present) to be killed by \\"loopers\\": hired guns paid in silver to kill whoever is sent to them. The victims have bags over their heads, and silver bars strapped to their backs. This comes at a price: The severe sanctions on time travel mean that crime bosses eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as \\"closing the loop\\", which each looper must do himself. They're paid in gold for this, to live the rest of their lives in comfort.Joseph \\"Joe\\" Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), 25, works for a mafia company in Kansas City as a looper.

Abe also controls the \\"Gat Men,\\" his muscle, led by Kid Blue (Noah Segan). Gat men are so named for their magnum revolvers, which have greater range and accuracy than a looper's 'blunderbuss' shotgun; a weapon designed strictly for close quarters.While at the club one evening, another looper announces that he has just closed his loop.

After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.

After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.

Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal. Question: How did the scientists put Keta into clinical death? Options: A: By putting her to sleep, lowering her temperature and draining her blood.

Rebecca would not apply glitter to her costume, like Kayla did, because","completion":"she had always been particular about making her own mark, creating unique statements that reflected her vibrant personality. She wanted her costume, like every aspect of her art, to be singular and expressive, rather than blending in with the rest. Glitter had once been a vital component of her creativity, but she had evolved since then; she now sought out more intricate patterns and bold textures to truly make a statement. The night before the costume party, Rebecca lay awake in her bedroom, surrounded by her vast collection of supplies - beads, sequins, and various fabrics of intriguing patterns. The pile had begun as a haphazard collection of materials, but gradually, a vision had arisen from the chaos, forming the sketch of a costume that would illuminate her personal insights and be true to her nature. As Rebecca's fingertips danced along the various fabrics, they fell upon a rare, iridescent fabric. The cloth shimmered with an evanescent, diffused radiance, reminiscent of a breathtaking sunset reflecting off a calm, deep ocean. It struck Rebecca as the perfect symbol of her transition from her glittering past to her enlightened present, and she couldn't resist the urge to include it in her ensemble. The next day, Rebecca immersed herself in the design process. Seamlessly weaving the iridescent fabric into her costume, she created an opulent cape that swirled around her like a celestial creation. Next, she adorned it with clusters of crystals and pearls, meticulously arranged in complex patterns, emulating constellations etched across a velvety night sky. To contrast the magical quality of the cape, she crafted a form-fitting ensemble of midnight black velvet, richly embroidered with threads of gold and silver. It was an astonishing contrast, the essence of darkness juxtaposed with heavenly bodies shimmering in splendor. When the costume came together in its entirety, Rebecca stepped back to admire her masterpiece, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction. It was powerful, mesmerizing, and, most importantly, it was her. Once at the costume party, Rebecca entered the room, and the atmosphere was electric. Her friends and fellow artists' eyes widened with admiration as they beheld her awe-inspiring creation. Kayla, dressed in her glitter-studded outfit, smiled at her friend with genuine appreciation for her originality and skill. As they danced and laughed at the party, Rebecca reflected on the sisterhood between them, grateful for the diversity and unique artistic approaches that united them. The evening felt like a celebration of not just individuality, but also the profound bond that artists share - the connection that comes from knowing that they are free to express themselves, each in their own way. Throughout the night, Rebecca reveled in the success and admiration her one-of-a-kind costume garnered. She was proud to stand beside Kayla and their artist friends, who all embraced their unique perspectives and styles. Together, they all shone with a brilliance that far exceeded the sum of their individual lights. Ultimately, Rebecca's decision to avoid glitter in her costume had allowed her to create a true work of art—an unforgettable statement on her journey of self-discovery and creative evolution. In her refusal to simply follow in the steps of others, she had not only crafted an unforgettable masterpiece but also affirmed the importance of sticking to one's creative vision. It was an irrefutable success, a testament to the power of a singular vision and individual expression, and a night Rebecca would never forget."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. I am facing a new situation today: The extensive grazing in Tibet lead to carbon and nitrogen loss, subject to desertification, while Nepal adopted a different approach to food production, putting nature and biodiversity first. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it appears that Nepal experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity compared to Tibet. The reason behind this conclusion is that Nepal has adopted a different approach to food production, prioritizing nature and biodiversity, which results in a more sustainable and adaptable ecosystem. This approach helps maintain the soil quality, nutrient retention, and overall productivity of the land. In contrast, extensive grazing in Tibet has led to carbon and nitrogen loss, making the land more susceptible to desertification and reducing its biodiversity. This decline in biodiversity and soil quality negatively affects the ecosystem's adaptability to disasters and limits the availability of food resources for animals, ultimately reducing the anthropogenic productivity of the land. Therefore, Nepal's approach in prioritizing nature and biodiversity appears to result in higher anthropogenic productivity compared to Tibet's land degradation due to extensive grazing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, option (a), \\"a thick pelt,\\" is consistent with the details provided by the teacher. Step 4: Eliminate other options: While energy sources may also aid in maintaining body temperatures, they are not specifically stated in the hints. ‘Evaporation’ is a cooling process, 'four limbs' and 'organic molecules' are not directly related to warmth.

English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A grassroots movement (often referenced in the context of a political movement) is one which uses the people in a given district as the basis for a political or economic movement. Grassroots movements and organizations utilize collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national, or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures. Grassroots movements, using self-organization, encourages community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community. Grassroots movements utilize a variety of strategies from fundraising and registering voters, to simply encouraging political conversation. Goals of specific movements vary, but the movements are consistent in their focus on increasing mass participation in politics. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.

When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. Question: Which of the following statements is WRONG? Answer: Available options: [A]. One should clarify(,) the list according to one's abilities.. [B]. Refer to admissions counselor at high school if necessary.. [C]. One doesn't have to send his test scores to the intended college..

Her last record, an ambitious blend of melancholic melodies and infectious synth-pop, skyrocketed straight to number one on the charts. Fans clamored for more of her introspective lyrics and soaring hooks, but behind the façade of success was a restless artist, grappling with creative dissatisfaction and searching for deeper meaning in her music. Striving for originality and creative fulfillment is what has pushed Diamandis forward throughout her career. From her eclectic debut 'The Family Jewels' in 2010, to the glittering electro-pop of 'Electra Heart' in 2012, and her contemplative 2015 record, ‘FROOT’, Marina has constantly evolved her sound and style. Though her journey to stardom seemed to culminate in her last album “Love + Fear” (2019), which topped the charts, it left her feeling incomplete. For many artists, achieving commercial success and critical acclaim would be the pinnacle of their career. For Marina, however, it proved to be a turning point. The pressure to churn out hits and cater to audience expectations left her feeling disconnected from her own identity. The glitz, glamour, and fabricated personas built around her image obscured the introspective songwriting and sincere storytelling that once defined her work. Quickly, Marina realized that she had lost sight of what truly mattered: making music that resonated with her soul and inspired her listeners.

The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders. Nina hides in the trunk of the Duesenberg, promising to slip away with Cameron during the stunt.

For the Cincinnati Bengals, a particular game in question brought about just such a transformation. In the aftermath of this crucial encounter, the Bengals steadily notched up an impressive tally of victories, dominating their competition. In this article, we closely examine the Cincinnati Bengals' striking progress following that game and quantify their overall performance by comparing their wins to losses. A Look at the Numbers: To assess the team's achievements, we must first analyze their games and quantify the difference between the victories and the defeats they suffered. After diligently examining the season in question, it is evident that the Bengals won a total of 30 games. In contrast, they faced defeat 20 times during the same time frame. To calculate the difference between the two statistics, we simply subtract the number of losses from the total number of wins: Difference = Wins - Losses Difference = 30 - 20 Difference = 10 Thus, the Cincinnati Bengals won ten more games than they lost in the season following that particular game. Factors Behind the Improvement: The team's outstanding performance can be attributed to a number of factors. These include: 1. Enhanced Team Dynamics: The coaches worked rigorously to foster a better understanding between the players, both on and off the field. This collaborative atmosphere elevates cooperation and allows the players to function as a cohesive unit, ensuring more efficient gameplay. 2. Skill Development: The team management ensured that the players were provided with ample opportunities to improve their skills, which paid off during the games. Individual achievements such as catching, passing, tackling, and rushing contributed significantly to the team's overall winning record. 3. Strategic Improvements: The coaching staff implemented new strategies, focusing on maximizing the players' strengths while neutralizing the opposing teams' weaknesses. This approach allowed the Bengals to exploit their rivals' vulnerabilities effectively. 4. High Morale: A series of victories consequent to the pivotal game greatly boosted the team's morale. Confident and encouraged by their achievements, the Bengals approached each new match with a winning mindset and a thirst for continued success. Looking Ahead: The Cincinnati Bengals' impressive performance in the season following that crucial game serves as a testament to the power of teamwork, determination, and constant improvement. Having proved themselves by securing ten more victories than defeats, the team's upward trajectory continues to inspire fans and emerging athletes alike. As they stride forward to confront future challenges, the Bengals' extraordinary journey during the season in question is certain to remain a high point in their sports history, as well as a shining example of resilience and competitive spirit for aspiring footballers worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"A shaggy white dog plays with a colorful chew toy.\\", is the sentence \\"The dog has long hair.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the given sentence, \\"A shaggy white dog plays with a colorful chew toy.\\", it is reasonable to infer that the sentence \\"The dog has long hair.\\" is likely to be true. The term \\"shaggy\\" is the key descriptor used for the white dog in this context. When a dog is described as shaggy, it generally refers to having long, unkempt, or messy fur. Therefore, drawing from this description, one would assume that the dog has long hair. Although it is not stated explicitly that \\"The dog has long hair\\" in the original sentence, we can make a logical connection between the characteristic \\"shaggy\\" and the possibility of having long hair. However, it is important to note that this is an inference based on the context provided and not an explicit fact from the sentence itself. There is room for interpretation, and the assumption could be incorrect if the author meant \\"shaggy\\" with a different connotation. In summary, given the information we have in the original sentence, it is likely that \\"The dog has long hair\\" is a true statement due to the use of the adjective 'shaggy' describing the dog's appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: What giant beast was kidnapped from Skull Island?","completion":"The giant beast that was kidnapped from Skull Island is none other than King Kong, a colossal, preternaturally powerful, gorilla-like creature that has enthralled audiences for nearly a century in various films and other forms of media. King Kong first appeared in the 1933 RKO Radio Pictures film \\"King Kong,\\" directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack. The character of King Kong originated from the creative minds of Cooper, who was inspired by his love for adventure films and the concept of a giant, fearsome creature, and Edgar Wallace, a British screenwriter, who co-wrote the initial screenplay. However, Wallace passed away before the film's completion, and James Creelman, Ruth Rose, and Schoedsack took over, revising the script and finalizing the story. In the narrative of the 1933 film, Skull Island is depicted as an isolated and mysterious island located in the Indian Ocean. This remote, uncharted island is home to various prehistoric creatures and a tribe of native people who worship and fear King Kong as their god. The island is discovered by a group of adventurous explorers and filmmakers led by Carl Denham (played by Robert Armstrong), who wants to make a movie about this mysterious place and its wonders. Upon arrival, the explorers encounter Ann Darrow (portrayed by Fay Wray), a beautiful young actress who intrigues Kong and becomes his object of affection. The gigantic beast kidnaps her and carries her to the top of a cliff. Conflict erupts between the crew, the island's inhabitants, and the monstrous creatures that seek to harm Ann. Eventually, King Kong is subdued and, seeing his potential as a wonder to present to the world, Denham decides to capture the giant ape. King Kong is shackled and transported back to New York City as a spectacle for the public to marvel at. However, Kong breaks free from his chains, causing chaos throughout the city, and seeks out Ann Darrow. The climax of the film ensues as King Kong carries Ann to the top of the Empire State Building, with military planes in pursuit attempting to bring down the massive beast. He ultimately falls to his death after being hit by multiple bullets from the planes, with the iconic final line of the movie suggesting that \\"it wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast.\\" Over the years, the tale of King Kong has been revisited and reimagined in multiple film versions, including a 1976 remake directed by John Guillermin, a 2005 retelling by Peter Jackson, and the more recent \\"Kong: Skull Island\\" (2017) directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. Each version of the story maintains the essential plot elements of King Kong's kidnapping from Skull Island and his subsequent tragic demise. As a cultural icon, King Kong continues to fascinate and captivate audiences as the ultimate embodiment of the clash between nature, civilization, and the dangers of unrestrained exploration and exploitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pair were found brutally stabbed to death at Ms Brown Simpson's LA home on June 12, 1994.

Who was the director of the American erotic thriller Call me, starring an American stage, film, television actor, and singer born on May 11, 1953? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key information in the question. The question asks for the director of an American erotic thriller called \\"Call Me\\", and the movie stars an actor born on May 11, 1953. Step 2: Gather the necessary information to answer the question. To answer the question, first, we need to identify the actor mentioned in the question. Since the actor's birthdate is mentioned (May 11, 1953), we can use this to find the actor's name. After some research, we find out that the actor is Frances Fisher. Step 3: Find the movie in which the actor starred. Now that we have the name of the actor, we can find the movie \\"Call Me\\" in which they starred. Step 4: Identify the director of the movie. After some research about the movie \\"Call Me\\", it becomes clear that there's some confusion in the question itself. The actual movie in which Frances Fisher starred is called \\"Passion Fish\\" directed by John Sayles. There was no movie called \\"Call Me\\" starring Frances Fisher. Step 5: Correct the question and provide an answer. Given the confusion regarding the title of the movie, the final answer to the corrected question would be: Corrected question: Who was the director of the American drama film \\"Passion Fish\\", starring Frances Fisher?

Short movie review: over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, it is evident that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. This conclusion can be drawn from a careful analysis of the review's content and the language used to describe the film. Firstly, the critic states that the movie is \\"over the map thematically and stylistically,\\" which suggests a lack of a clear focus or direction in the film. The term \\"over the map\\" typically implies disorganization and inconsistency, which are negative qualities when evaluating a movie. The critic is implying that the movie does not have a coherent theme or style, making it difficult for the audience to fully appreciate or grasp its intended message. Secondly, the critic says that the movie \\"borrows heavily from Lynch, Jeunet, and von Trier.\\" This statement indicates that the movie heavily leans on the ideas and styles of these well-known filmmakers. The use of the word \\"borrows\\" implies that the movie couldn't create an original concept and needed to depend on the influences of others to support its narrative. This perception further hints at a sense of unoriginality and lack of creativity, which is again a negative attribute. Lastly, the critic mentions that the film \\"fails to find a spark of its own.\\" This phrase serves as the most apparent and direct indication of the critic's negative opinion. By failing to find a spark of its own, the movie lacks a unique aspect that distinguishes it from other movies. Essentially, it could not create a niche or identity for itself in the cinematic landscape, resulting in an uninspired and dull experience. In conclusion, the critic's opinion of the movie is unequivocally negative. The review highlights various aspects such as lack of cohesiveness, unoriginality, and inability to create a distinct identity that contribute to an unfavorable perception of the movie. Therefore, the answer is A). Negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Summarize: The sub-dollar level is unusual even in the US, where the average national price on Sunday was 1.89, according to the American Automobile Association. But the steep drop in Michigan is indicative of the struggle engulfing the oil industry in the US and globally. Growing competition, excess supply and shrinking demand are forcing the price of oil to record lows. In the US, perhaps, no group understands this more clearly than the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) industry - the producers of shale oil and gas. Fracking took off in the US in 2010 as a means to extract large reserves of oil from within hard rock. The industry had support from the government as a means of achieving energy independence and bringing down prices at the pump. As a worldwide oversupply has grown and the price of oil has dropped to a 12-year low - below 30 a barrel - many shale oil producers have been forced to shut their doors or make cuts to keep costs down. By November last year, 93,800 people had been laid off by US-based energy companies in 2015, according to research compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \\"All the companies that survive will be leaner and be able to do more with less,\\" says Sam Ori, executive director of The Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. According to law firm Haynes & Boone, 42 oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy in North America in 2015. This number is expected to increase this year as the industry struggles to cope with mounting corporate debt and oil prices that have dropped 70% in 18 months. A third of US oil and gas companies could be gone by the middle of 2017, according to Wolfe Research. Getting to that leaner point will not be easy. The US shale oil boom took off in just a few years and now adds millions of barrels per day to the global supply. And global oil inventories continue to grow after OPEC's (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) decision to keep output high. OPEC, a group of some of the largest oil producing nations, typically cuts production to keep global oil prices high. In the face of growing US competition driving prices down, the group opted to maintain high levels of production, resulting in a global oil glut. There was an excess of 2.6 million barrels of oil produced each day in 2015, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Face with this excess, and resulting low prices, US frackers are cutting costs. Many have opted not to drill new wells, instead focusing on creating technologies that allow them to get more oil out of the wells they have already drilled. According to Mr Ori, the number of shale producers that has failed is smaller than many expected, but most analysts still anticipate consolidation in 2016 as companies merge or buy up weaker rivals. One reason the situation is expected to be so hard in the US is because the cost of fracking is much higher than other extraction methods. Fracking requires drilling horizontally into rock and then blasting water at high pressure to extract oil and gas. To get started, many companies relied on debt, which they guaranteed with oil reserves. As the price of oil has dropped, it has become harder for companies to pay off this debt and harder to convince banks to extend new loans. \\"The cash flows that companies are turning out are lower and they have less borrowing capacity because lenders are more nervous,\\" says Dan Pickering, head of asset management at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an energy focused investment bank. According to him, the lack of access to borrowing and lower cash flows have made it harder for frackers to reinvest in new projects. This lack of investment could see supplies shrink and prices rise. This rebalancing could still take several years. According to the IEA, global demand for oil is expected to grow by just 1.2 million barrels a day in 2016 a slowdown from the growth of 1.8 million barrels per day in 2015. This will make it more difficult to cut the oversupply particularly as OPEC, US shale producers and new oil producers like Iran add to the inventory. In a report published this week, the IEA estimated the global oil industry would produce 1.5 million excess barrels per day in 2016. \\"This inventory overhanging will have to be drawn down for the market to tighten up,\\" says Mr Pickering, though he is still convinced oil prices will pick up by the end of the year. \\"The under investment that is happening in the oil patch will translate to lower supply and that will be most visible in North America, and that will show up in the rest of the world in 2017 or 2018,\\" he says. Most oil companies, especially in the US, are not counting on that increase. The industry is expected to see more job cuts on top of the over 250,000 global layoffs that took place in 2015, making the overall outlook for the industry pretty bleak. Summary:","completion":"The US oil industry, particularly the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) sector, is struggling due to growing competition, excess supply, and shrinking demand.

A third of US oil and gas companies could disappear by mid-2017 as the industry struggles with debt and oil prices that have dropped 70% in 18 months.

[Erl Murati/SETimes] Translate to English English:","completion":"Vidatox, a controversial new product. [Erl Murati/SETimes] Vidatox is a new product that has been generating significant debate and controversy in recent times. It is a homeopathic treatment that claims to have positive effects on various ailments, particularly in the area of cancer treatment. The product is made from the venom of the blue scorpion, which is native to Cuba, and is said to have beneficial components that aid in the fight against cancer and other chronic pain-related conditions. The controversy surrounding Vidatox arises from several factors. As a homeopathic treatment, it generally faces skepticism from the mainstream medical community due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting homeopathy as an effective treatment method for serious illnesses. Furthermore, Vidatox’s specific claim of cancer-treating properties has raised concerns and doubts from cancer researchers and healthcare professionals alike. One of the main issues is the fact that the Vidatox clinical trials have so far been limited in scope, conducted primarily in Cuba and involving relatively small sample sizes. There is an overall lack of transparency and data sharing, making it difficult for independent researchers and medical professionals to verify or refute the claims made by the producers of Vidatox. This has led to reluctance from many experts in the cancer research field to endorse or recommend Vidatox as a viable treatment option for cancer patients. Another point of contention is the high price tag associated with Vidatox, which can range from several hundred to thousands of dollars for a single course of treatment. This raises ethical concerns regarding the accessibility of the product to patients who may not have the financial means to afford such expensive therapies, especially when its effectiveness is not yet fully proven. It is worth noting that Vidatox and its proponents do not claim that the product is a cure-all for cancer and suggest that it is meant to be used alongside conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, the lack of substantial scientific evidence to support the efficacy of Vidatox, combined with the high cost, continues to fuel skepticism and debate in the medical and cancer research communities. In conclusion, Vidatox, the controversial new product derived from blue scorpion venom, has sparked significant discussion and debate due to its claims of being an effective cancer treatment, among other health benefits. While its impact on cancer remains uncertain, the ongoing debate highlights the importance of rigorous scientific research and transparency in assessing the credibility and utility of new medical treatments and products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: weights Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, we first need to define the context of the problem and the naive physics reasoning better. Naive physics reasoning refers to the common-sense understanding that people have about the physical world around them. This type of reasoning usually doesn't involve formal scientific knowledge or detailed calculations but is based on everyday experiences and intuitive ideas about how things should behave. Now, to evaluate the solutions, we need to know the specific problem or scenario that these solutions refer to. There could be numerous scenarios in relation to weights. Some examples include: 1. Balancing weights on a scale. 2. Lifting weights as a form of exercise. 3. Weight distribution in structures (e.g., buildings, bridges). 4. Comparing the weights of different objects. 5. Determining the optimal weight of a certain object. Unfortunately, based on the information provided in your request, it is not possible to determine which of these scenarios or any other specific context that you are referring to.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"To answer the first question, let's delve into the quote's meaning: Step 1: Understand the context Benjamin Franklin is often erroneously attributed with this quote. The quote is actually from Winston Churchill. He made this statement during a speech defending democracy as the best form of government available, despite its flaws. Step 2: Break down the quote By saying \\"democracy is the worst form of government except for all others,\\" Churchill means that while democracy has its problems, it's better than all other known forms of government. This implies that democracy has flaws, but it still outperforms alternatives like monarchy, dictatorship, etc. Now, let's analyze the second question: The question asks what will come after democracy, implying that the user is interested in the potential evolution or replacement of democracy as a form of government. Step 1: Understand the context The question seeks to explore the potential future of government structures and how democracy might change or be surpassed. Step 2: Analyze possibilities There are countless theories on what could come after democracy, such as technocracy, meritocracy, or even a fusion of different systems. While it's impossible to accurately predict the future of government, the question explores potential adaptations or alternatives to democracy.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is a former real estate developer?, using the article: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive., what would be the answer ?

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where did Napoleon build his force?\\" is in \\"Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. - The Isle of Wight Festival is a music festival which takes place annually on the Isle of Wight in England.

Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. - A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds. This article gives an overview of ceramic materials from the point of view of materials science. - Pottery is the craft of making ceramic material into pots or potterywares using mud. Major types of potterywares include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a \\"potter\\" is called a \\"pottery\\" (plural \\"potteries\\"). The technical definition of \\"pottery\\" used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is \\"all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products.\\" - Scrapbooking is a method, an art for preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, card.

It was recorded and released in 1972 as Grunt FTR - 1007 , and peaked at No. 20 in America . - Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation. - A rock festival, often considered synonymous with pop festival, is a large-scale rock music concert, featuring multiple acts performing an often diverse range of popular music including rock, pop, folk, electronic, and related genres. - Jefferson Airplane was a rock band based in San Francisco, California, who pioneered psychedelic rock. Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960sMonterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out album \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" ranks on the short list of most significant recordings of the \\"Summer of Love\\". Two songs from that album, \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", are among \\"Rolling Stone's\\" \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\" - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures.

When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - The San Francisco Sound refers to rock music performed live and recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community in San Francisco during these years. San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \\"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore.\\" - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast. - ) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word \\"origami\\" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat sheet square of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word \\"\\" to refer to designs which use cuts, although cutting is more characteristic of Chinese papercrafts. - Woodworking is the activity or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (Cabinetry and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning. - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art.

The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - A studio is an artist's or worker's workroom, or the catchall term for an artist and their employees who work within that studio. This can be for the purpose of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking, photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified to dance studio. - The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood Haight-Ashbury. Although hippies also gathered in many other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe, San Francisco was at that time the most publicized location for hippie fashions. - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners. - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage. - Surrealistic Pillow is the second album by American rock band Jefferson Airplane, released on February 1, 1967, by RCA Victor (LSP-3766 [stereo] and LPM-3766 [mono]). It is the first album by the band with vocalist Grace Slick and drummer Spencer Dryden. The album peaked at number three on the \\"Billboard\\" album chart and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Jane Jacobs (born Jane Butzner; May 4, 1916 - April 25, 2006) was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist who influenced urban studies, sociology, and economics. Her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. It also introduced the sociological concepts \\"eyes on the street\\" and \\"social capital\\". Jacobs organized grassroots efforts to protect neighborhoods from \\"slum clearance\\", in particular Robert Moses' plans to overhaul her own Greenwich Village neighborhood. She became a feature writer for the Office of War Information, and then a reporter for Amerika, a publication of the U.S. State Department. While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for Grumman. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 Hudson St. Jane continued to write for Amerika after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect. The Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as \\"parasitic\\", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village. They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard. Working for the State Department during the McCarthy era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the Federal Workers Union because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of Saul Alinsky; therefore she was under suspicion. On March 25, 1952, Jacobs delivered a now-famous response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the United States Department of State. In her foreword to her answer, she said: The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ...","completion":"This text is about Jane Jacobs, who was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist.

Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.

Process: - Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air - These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain - The rain with the high acid content falls. Question: suppose companies are required to clean after the mess they do happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze each step and justify how the proposed perturbation (companies cleaning up the mess they make) will influence the second step mentioned (the release of substances, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, into the air). Step 1: Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air If companies are required to clean up after themselves, they would need to take measures to reduce the release of harmful chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, into the atmosphere. This could include investing in better technologies for filtering emissions, finding alternative ways to produce energy without producing harmful pollutants, or using better materials to minimize waste. This would result in fewer chemicals being released into the air. Step 2: These substances rise into the high atmosphere With fewer sulfur dioxide and nitrogen emissions released into the air, the concentration of these substances in the atmosphere will be lower compared to a scenario where companies do not clean up their mess. A decreased concentration of these substances reduces the potential for these chemicals to rise into the high atmosphere. Now, let's evaluate how this perturbation influences the second effect mentioned: Step 3: They react with water and oxygen Reduced sulfur dioxide and nitrogen concentrations in the atmosphere lead to less water and oxygen reacting with them, ultimately resulting in a decreased production of acidic compounds that contribute to acid rain. Step 4: This creates a more acidic rain Since fewer acidic compounds are being produced, the overall acidity of the rain will be lower, reducing acid rain's potential for environmental damage. Step 5: The rain with the high acid content falls With reduced acidity, the impact of acid rain on the environment when it falls will be lowered, causing less property damage, soil degradation, and harm to aquatic life. Based on the steps outlined above, and the perturbation's impact on those steps, it can be concluded that the proposed measure of companies cleaning up their mess will have a \\"less\\" effect on the second step (substances rising into the high atmosphere), ultimately resulting in less acid rain-causing substances' impact on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The like terms in the equation are -18117*s and 18077*s. We need to add these terms together. -18117*s + 18077*s = -40*s So, the simplified equation is: -40*s + 1160 = 0 Step 2: Isolate s. To get s alone on one side of the equation, we want to get rid of -40 from the left side of the equation. We will do this by adding 40*s to both sides: -40*s + 40*s + 1160 = 40*s + 0 Which simplifies to: 1160 = 40*s Step 3: Solve for s. Now, we have a simple equation with s on one side. To find the value of s, we need to divide both sides by 40: 1160 / 40 = 40*s / 40 The equation simplifies to: 29 = s So, s = 29 The solution to the math problem is s = 29."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A doctor suspected his mistress had poisoned him, but was afraid to contact authorities in case she tried to attack him or his girlfriend as he recovered, a court has heard. Dr. George Blumenschein believes his ex-mistress, Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, poisoned him after she found out he was trying to have children with his partner. Gonzalez-Angulo, a breast cancer doctor based at Houston's famed Texas Medical Center, is charged with aggravated assault after prosecutors say she spiked Blumenschein's coffee in 2013 with ethylene glycol, a sweet-tasting chemical found in antifreeze. Scroll down for video. Dr. George Blumenschein (left) suspected his mistress Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, (right) had poisoned him, but was afraid to contact authorities in case she tried to attack him or his girlfriend as he recovered, a court has heard. Yesterday his long-term partner Evette Toney told jurors that Blumenschein feared the other woman might attack him again while he recovered in the hospital. Prosecutors say that Gonzalez-Angulo and Blumenschein, a fellow researcher, were involved in a casual sexual relationship. They say Gonzalez-Angulo's relationship with Blumenschein turned into a 'fatal attraction' after he spurned her in favor of Toney, his 10-year live-in girlfriend, with whom he was trying to have children. His long-term partner Evette Toney (pictured) told jurors that Blumenschein feared the other woman might attack him again while he recovered in the hospital. Witnesses have testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where she and Blumenschein worked. But Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys have argued that other people may be responsible for his poisoning, including Toney. Blumenschein survived the poisoning but told jurors this week he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function. If convicted, Gonzalez-Angulo, 43, could be sentenced to up to life in prison. While questioned by prosecutors, Toney told jurors that she did not poison Blumenschein and that despite the affair she still loves him. She said they are still together and are working on their relationship. Witnesses have testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, (pictured) where she and Blumenschein worked. 'It's a work in progress,' she said. Toney testified that shortly after Blumenschein was hospitalized following his poisoning, he told her that he believed Gonzalez-Angulo had poisoned him. But Toney said he told her to not tell anybody of his suspicions because he feared Gonzalez-Angulo might hurt him again or hurt her. 'At one point, George said, 'Evette, do not poke the dragon,'' Toney said. Toney testified she helped Blumenschein record telephone conversations he had with Gonzalez-Angulo as part of efforts to try and gather evidence against her. Gonzalez-Angulo did not make a confession on the phone calls, but prosecutors have said they show the obsessive feelings she had toward Blumenschein. While Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys questioned Toney, they suggested that Toney had been upset Blumenschein would not marry her. Blumenschein (centre arriving at court) survived the poisoning but told jurors this week he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function. Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys (pictured) suggested Toney got angry with Blumenschein about an affair she had long suspected. Toney said that Blumenschein was afraid of marriage and that she had moved out of their home in 2009 because he wouldn't make a long-term commitment. But Toney said the two got back together and focused on the future, including having children. Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys suggested Toney got angry with Blumenschein about an affair she had long suspected. Toney said she didn't know about the affair until after Blumenschein told her about it following his poisoning and that she wasn't interested in hurting Blumenschein. 'I didn't follow him. I didn't check his BlackBerry. I trusted him,' she said. Testimony was to resume on Wednesday in the trial, which began September 15. Prosecutors might rest their case on Wednesday.

Which entity is this text about? William McKinley (January 29, 1843 - September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (nee Allison) McKinley (1809-1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County. The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist. In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.

The degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy. Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers. Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation. Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents. Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors. Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How is behavioral autonomy defined?","completion":"Behavioral autonomy is defined as an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern.

It comes from former documentary director Ulrich Seidl who adopts a very documentary-like approach to the material. However, the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as \\"extremes\\"  some are extremely lonely; some extremely violent; some extremely weird; some extremely devious; some extremely frustrated and misunderstood; and so on. The film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time, each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering Viennese summer. Very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people, the many ills that plague our society in general. It is a thought-provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole. A fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife's clothes. A nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy-racer boyfriend. A couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people. An abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again. A security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat. And a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car! The lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave. The despair in the film is palpable. Many scenes are characterised by long, awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be. Then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on-screen events leave you reeling. In particular, a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch-hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy - to be beaten, raped and humiliated (thankfully all off-screen) for some vandalism she didn't even do - arouses a sour, almost angry taste. In another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear-end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint, all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife. While we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come-uppance, we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment. Indeed, such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film - every moment of light-heartedness is counter-balanced with a moment of coldness. Every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair. For every character you could like or feel sympathy for, there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate. We might want to turn away from Hundstage, to dismiss it as an exercise in misery, but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded.

By Chris Parsons PUBLISHED: 07:31 EST, 18 June 2012 | UPDATED: 08:04 EST, 18 June 2012 Inappropriate: Nicola Newman, 33, made the comment when her colleague asked why she had not been invited to her hen party A 'racist' nurse who imitated Ali G in front of a colleague has been found guilty of misconduct. Nicola Newman, 33, told colleague Marilyn Rowe she was not invited to her hen party in Las Vegas 'coz you is black' in front of other employees at Birmingham Children's Hospital. The comment, which Ms Newman said was 'banter' left Ms Rowe feeling 'disgusted' and 'quite upset' and was judged by a member of a misconduct panel as being racist.

An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. and a hint : New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Please answer this question : Which friend studied less about the natural development of species?

The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The North American Plate is a tectonic plate covering most of North America, Greenland, Cuba, the Bahamas, extreme northeastern Russia, and parts of Iceland and the Azores. It extends eastward to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and westward to the Chersky Range in eastern Siberia. The plate includes both continental and oceanic crust. The interior of the main continental landmass includes an extensive granitic core called a craton. Along most of the edges of this craton are fragments of crustal material called terranes, accreted to the craton by tectonic actions over the long span of geologic time. It is thought that much of North America west of the Rocky Mountains is composed of such terranes. - The Kula Plate was an oceanic tectonic plate under the northern Pacific Ocean south of the Near Islands segment of the Aleutian Islands. It is subducted under the North American Plate at the Aleutian Trench and is surrounded by the Pacific Plate. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt \\"(Eje Volcánico Transversal)\\", also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada (\\"Snowy Mountain Range\\"), is a volcanic belt that covers central-southern Mexico. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they are visible to a large percentage of those who live on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - The Eastern Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, England) and west of the antimeridian. It is also used to refer to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes North and South America. This hemisphere may also be called the \\"Oriental Hemisphere\\". In addition, it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the \\"Old World\\". - The Okhotsk - Chukotka Volcanic Belt ( OCVB ) is a Cretaceous volcanic belt in northeastern Eurasia . It is one of the largest subduction - zone related volcanic provinces in the world , stretching some 3200 km and comprising about 2 million km3 of volcanic and plutonic material . The volcanism within the volcanic belt was related to the subduction of the ancient Kula Plate , which moved in a northward direction about 55 million years ago . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active region. Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity, such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of unusually high temperature (700-1400 °C) where magma is created by partial melting of solid material in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually form along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 1050 km. For example, volcanoes in Mexico and western North America are mostly in volcanic belts, such as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico and the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province in western Canada. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she.

Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The main character Yong-ho (Sol Kyung-gu) in the first scene of the movie is seen dressed in a suit encountering what looks like a reunion party which is taking place on the banks of a river over which a railway bridge runs. He is in a state of extreme psychological trauma. He is then recognised by the reunion party group who try to calm him down and involve him to participate in singing some karaoke songs in order to get him to relax. Yong-ho behaves in a very disturbed way and this behaviour completely shocks the reunion group. He then makes his way onto the elevated railway bridge. One of the guys from the reunion party runs over to the railway bridge and pleads with him to come down. Yong-ho waits for the oncoming train and the moment before he is killed he screams the words 'I want to go back again'.The film then traces Yong Ho's life in reverse starting with the unfolding of the most recent events in his life prior to him committing suicide and then working back in time from there to the earlier stages of his young adult life.In the most immediate past Yong-ho is seen living in a makeshift house on the edge of a highway and we learn how he arrived at this point by, among other things, losing money on the stock market, being ripped off by his business partner and being divorced from his wife. Here he is visited by an unknown man who asks him to visit this unknown man's terminally ill wife as this was her last request. This woman, we find out in time, was Yong-ho's true love years before, and who used to send him peppermints when Yong-ho was a soldier in the army.The movie takes us in rewind through Yong Ho's life from where he was a successful businessman, but philandering husband to a cheating wife, to where he was previously a brutal police officer and inconsiderate husband to a pregnant wife, to us seeing how, although he originally never really had it in him to be a brutal cop, but needed to be one and so, became one, to him spurning his true love and making sexual advances to another woman (which...

Answer:","completion":"The song \\"Counting Flowers on the Wall,\\" also known as \\"Flowers on the Wall,\\" is sung by the American country music group The Statler Brothers. This group, formed in 1955, initially comprised of four members: Harold Reid, Phil Balsley, Lew DeWitt, and Joe McDorman. Later on, Don Reid joined the group replacing Joe McDorman, and Jimmy Fortune replaced Lew DeWitt in 1982. \\"Flowers on the Wall\\" was written by the group's original tenor, Lew DeWitt, and was included in their debut album \\"Flowers on the Wall,\\" which was released in 1966. The song was a major success, reaching number 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and achieving wide recognition in both the country and pop music genres. The song's intriguing lyrics, which describe the life of a recluse who claims to be perfectly content staying home alone, counting flowers on the wall, playing solitaire, and smoking cigarettes, have captivated audiences for decades. In addition to the success of \\"Flowers on the Wall,\\" The Statler Brothers had a long and illustrious career, earning numerous awards, including three Grammy Awards and being named the Country Music Association's Vocal Group of the Year eight times.

He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. This thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense: 1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away! 2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost. 3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the...? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together. 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information. 5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help. And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense. Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit.

Often after a night of drinking at the bar, Jake takes the party home where dozens of intoxicated people flood their home and drink into the early morning.

Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Colbert was born in Washington, D.C., the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family. He spent his early years in Bethesda, Maryland. He grew up on James Island, South Carolina. Colbert and his siblings, in descending order by age, are James III, Edward, Mary, William, Margo, Thomas, Jay, Elizabeth, Paul, Peter, and Stephen. While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. \\"I wasn't gonna do Second City\\", Colbert later recalled, \\"because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv - there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people\\". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly. Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for Steve Carell. It was there he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello, with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first - Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as \\"an illiterate thug\\" - but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility. When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show Exit 57. The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series. Following the cancelation of Exit 57, Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on The Dana Carvey Show, alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, and also Robert Smigel, Charlie Kaufman, Louis C.K., and Dino Stamatopoulos, among others. The series, described by one reviewer as \\"kamikaze satire\\" in \\"borderline-questionable taste\\", had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes. Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for Saturday Night Live with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, to SNL from The Dana Carvey Show; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for VH1 and MTV, before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for Good Morning America. Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to The Daily Show's then-producer, Madeline Smithberg, who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997. What was his first gig?","completion":"Stephen Colbert's first gig was as a performer with Second City's touring company, initially serving as an understudy for Steve Carell. He landed this opportunity after taking improvisation classes at the Second City training center when he was working answering phones and selling souvenirs at their box office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Join an Amateur Athletic Union team in your area. Attend summer camps to grab coaches' attention.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Path to Basketball Success: Practice, AAU Teams, and Summer Camps Introduction Basketball is a sport that calls for passion, dedication, and hard work. It's a game that provides thrill and excitement, as well as opens doors to numerous opportunities for every individual who dares to step onto the court. For those who aspire to improve their skills, earn recognition, or even play at a professional level, it requires a commitment to regular practice, strong connections within the community, and exposure to the right training platforms. In this article, we delve into three critical elements that can help elevate your basketball skills: playing consistently, joining Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams, and attending summer camps. I. Play Basketball Consistently to Improve Your Game They say practice makes perfect, and this saying rings true for basketball players. Engaging in consistent practice is the secret to enhancing your skills, understanding the intricacies of the game, and honing a significant edge over your competition. This unwavering dedication allows you to: 1. Develop muscle memory: The consistent repetition of movements, such as shooting, dribbling, and passing, helps develop your muscle memory. Over time, these actions become instinctual, allowing you to perform them seamlessly and naturally. 2. Enhance physical fitness: Playing basketball regularly not only improves your skills but also contributes to your overall fitness. From cardiovascular endurance to strength and agility, committing to practice ensures your body is ready for the game. 3. Boost mental toughness: Consistent practice helps you become mentally tough, equipping you with the focus and resilience required to face challenges on the court. Through constant repetition, you learn to analyze situations more effectively and make smart decisions under pressure. II. Join an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Team in Your Area Another key ingredient in improving your basketball game is joining an AAU team. This union offers opportunities to expand your game and network, fostering a dynamic basketball community. Some benefits of joining an AAU team include: 1. High-level competition: AAU teams attract skilled players who aspire to excel in the sport. By participating, you are exposed to diverse styles, tactics, and higher levels of competition, which helps elevate your gameplay. 2. Increased exposure: Promising athletes can gain recognition from college recruiters and scouts at AAU tournaments. Playing in these tournaments can potentially lead to scholarships, a pivotal step toward a successful college or professional career. 3. Networking opportunities: Being part of an AAU team allows you to connect with other dedicated athletes, coaches, and trainers in the basketball community. These relationships can yield valuable insights and advice, as well as contribute to your overall growth as a player. III. Attend Summer Camps to Grab Coaches' Attention Participating in summer basketball camps is another powerful way to accelerate skill development, gain valuable experiences, and earn recognition. Summer camps provide: 1. Expert coaching: Experienced and professional coaches lead basketball camps, providing personalized guidance tailored to your skill set, strengths, and areas for improvement. 2. Exposure to different play styles and tactics: Basketball camps often include players from diverse backgrounds, allowing you to learn and adapt to various playing styles and tactics. Such exposure broadens your perspective on the game and encourages you to explore new techniques. 3. Opportunities for scouting: Similar to AAU tournaments, summer camps are frequented by college scouts and recruiters. Consistently playing at a high level in these camps can lead to scholarship opportunities and other avenues for advancing your basketball career. Conclusion Elevating your basketball game requires commitment, passion, and a proactive approach to seeking out valuable experiences. By consistently practicing, joining an AAU team, and participating in summer camps, you can develop your skills, gain recognition, and pave the way to a fulfilling basketball career. Embrace the journey, for the hard work and dedication you demonstrate on the court today will determine the opportunities that come your way in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background Paragraph: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.","completion":"Once upon a time in the land of CompuTerras, a small village called Efficio thrived, thanks to its ability to save and manage energy efficiently. The villagers were led by two wise elders, Winandra and Pentia. Winandra was a master of her arcane art, handed down through generations of the Windows bloodline, whereas Pentia impressed everyone with her adept knowledge of the x86 processors. Life was peaceful in Efficio, but modernization demanded more significant advancements. A new challenge came when residents realized the limited capacity of their present technology. To optimize energy consumption and save CPU power, an ancient technique had been employed, involving magical threads that ran within the System Idle Process. The village was dependent on these threads to conserve energy. A rebellious young blacksmith named Halus Abstraktus wished to bring more advanced methods to Efficio. He had heard stories of newer versions of the Windows Empire that boasted superior CPU energy-saving methods. Intrigued, Halus embarked on a journey to seek these secrets. After months of treacherous travel to distant lands, he discovered a hidden archive of wisdom. Within the archive, he found scrolls describing state-of-the-art power-saving techniques. It spoke of the Hardware Abstraction Layer's secret methods, which utilized the same idle threads to reduce CPU clock speed and implement other, more efficient ways to conserve energy. Halus returned to the village armed with this knowledge, and he quickly gained the attention of Winandra and Pentia. The wise elders, recognizing the potential in his findings, worked with Halus to incorporate the new methods into Efficio's systems. Gradually, they replaced the old loop of halt instructions with the cutting-edge strategies Halus had discovered. Transformation swept throughout Efficio. Thanks to the new power-saving techniques, the village's energy consumption dramatically decreased, and their technology thrived at levels never seen before. Their resourcefulness and sustainability became legendary, granting them prosperous relations with neighboring settlements. Efficio bloomed, and the people hailed Halus Abstraktus as a hero, forever grateful for the changes he had inspired."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do your family and friends love you or your stigma? That's right: they're two entirely separate things. When people that really care about you look at you, they see you as a person. So when you look at yourself, you should see “you,” too. It’s important to keep in mind that identity positions are not static. We all have some degree of freedom in positioning ourselves as one type of identity or another, regardless of how we are treated by others. Spend some time on your own to identify what you really enjoy doing. Make a list of your positive qualities. These can include your mannerisms, behaviors, and beliefs. Make a list of your characteristics that you could work on. For example, you might write, “I usually shy away from confrontation and I cave in too easily to other people’s demands.” Make a list of what you’d like to change about yourself and what you need to do to achieve these changes. For example, if you don’t want to cave in so easily to other people’s demands, you might write, “I want to learn to be more assertive.” Then, you might take an assertiveness training workshop. These steps will help you conceive of yourself in a way that doesn’t immediately put your stigma in the foreground. Your stigma might be a part of who you are and the challenges you have to deal with in this life, but they don't define you as a person. People in wheelchairs can still go skydiving. People who are hard of hearing can still hold conversations. They just have to learn a different way of doing things, but this does not stop them from living fulfilling lives. Whether the reasons for your stigma are visible or not, this is doable. A visible set of conditions would be being in a wheelchair or blind. An invisible issue would be HIV, renal disease, MS, or anything that doesn't immediately draw attention. Underneath your “condition,” however, you still exist. Your sense of humor, your wit, your smile and other aspects about you can hog the spotlight. Spend some extra time practicing the activities you excel at. This will help other people see you in a different light. When you are managing your stigma, it can seem like a very difficult task. It can be helpful to have some sort of mental reminder or mantra that will help refocus your attention away from what’s bothering you in the present. For example, imagine a person or place that makes you happy. Or, remind yourself that not everyone is ignorant about your stigma. Remind yourself about the supportive people in your life. When it comes to your own thoughts, pay attention to whether they are mostly negative or positive. If you can’t accept who you are, it will make it more difficult for people around you to do so. Never think there's something you can't do because of a disability. Try out new hobbies or activities. If you have physical trouble doing something, such as playing basketball, find a wheelchair basketball league. Having a positive attitude and trying new things are good first steps in building your confidence. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: Your stigma, whether visible or invisible, doesn't define you as a person. To overcome the challenges posed by your stigma, focus on your positive qualities, work on self-improvement, and find activities you excel at.

With a positive attitude and willingness to try new things, you can build confidence and show others that your unique characteristics don't define your entire identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: just a little irritated B: a lover of April Fool's C: amused by the movie","completion":"Answer B: a lover of April Fool's best answers the question according to the context. Since it was mentioned that playing a prank on their parents was Kai's first of April tradition, it can be inferred that Kai's parents are used to this activity and might even enjoy or anticipate it as part of their family tradition. In this case, the parents are more likely to be lovers of April Fool's, embracing the spirit of practical jokes and having a good sense of humor about it. Answer A, suggesting they might be just a little irritated, doesn't seem to be the best fit, as it assumes the parents would have a negative or somewhat annoyed response to the prank, rather than enjoying it as part of their tradition.

Für viele Menschen ist der Klimawandel erst jetzt Realität geworden, da man ausgerechnet hat, was er uns kosten wird. Translate this to English?","completion":"(Mr. President! For many people, climate change only became a reality now that it has been calculated what it will cost us.) Mr. President! The issue of climate change has become a reality for numerous individuals only recently, predominantly due to the fact that calculations have been made to estimate the financial implications it will bring forth. The growing realization that climate change is not only a threat to our environment and ecosystems, but also to our economies, infrastructure, and ultimately, our collective well-being, has prompted a significant shift in public perception. By placing a monetary value on the consequences of climate change, the severity of the issue has become more tangible and harder to ignore. We can now observe the potential costs associated with the consequences of climate change, which may include damage to infrastructure due to extreme weather events, increased expenditures in healthcare as a result of worsening air quality, and the loss of agricultural productivity due to shifting climate patterns. Furthermore, it has become increasingly evident that the costs of inaction far outweigh the investments required for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy, investing in renewable energy sources, and implementing climate adaptation measures are not only essential actions that need to be taken to minimize the financial burden of climate change, but they also provide economic opportunities in the form of job creation and sustainable development. As nations around the world come to grips with the reality of climate change and the price tag attached to it, it is imperative that concerted efforts are made to address this global challenge. This includes stepping up international climate negotiations, fostering collaborative research and development initiatives, and increasing public awareness and understanding of the issue and its possible solutions. In conclusion, the direct recognition of the monetary costs associated with climate change has presented us with a clearer understanding of its implications and further reinforces the necessity for immediate and decisive action. Our ability to limit the damage, safeguard our environment, and protect our future generations hinges upon the collaborative efforts of governments, organizations, and individuals alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This movie is horrible- in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. The storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind, that I'm not going to even bother describing it. It's a sword/sorcery picture, has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world, has a \\"nomadic\\" adventurer, an evil aide/sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature....you get the point. The first time I caught this movie was during a very harsh winter. I don't know why I decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when I caught site of Gulfax, I decided to stay and watch it until the end. Gulfax is a white, furry creature akin to Chewbacca, but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch. He looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within, or that he's almost falling over. Although he isn't in the movie that much, the few scenes are worth it! Watch as he attempts to talk smack to Bo Svenson, taking the Solo-Chewbacca comparison's to an even higher level! I actually bought this movie just because of that character, and still have it somewhere! Gulfax may look like sh!t, but he made this movie!!! The only reason I've never seen the sequel, or even sought it out, was because of his absence! Perhaps should there be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a much-anticipated return!","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down step by step: 1. The user mentions the movie is \\"horrible\\" but that it's in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. This indicates a mix of negative and positive sentiment, as the user finds enjoyment in the movie's shortcomings. 2. The user states that the storyline is rehashed and does not bother describing it. This denotes negative sentiment, as they believe the story is unoriginal. 3. The user decides to keep watching the movie after encountering the character Gulfax. This shows a vague sense of positive sentiment as Gulfax intrigues them enough to not change the channel. 4. The user found the Gulfax character to be absurd and poorly designed. Despite this, they enjoyed the character and watched the movie because of him. This indicates both negative and positive sentiment. 5. The user mentions they actually bought the movie and still have it, which reflects positive sentiment as they find value in it, even if just for its absurdity. 6. Finally, in reference to a potential sequel, the user states they would be interested if Gulfax returned, which implies a level of attachment to the movie and a positive sentiment towards it. Overall sentiment: The sentiment of this review is mixed, with both negative and positive sentiments expressed. While the user acknowledges the poor quality and unoriginal aspects of the movie, they find enjoyment and entertainment value in its absurdity, specifically because of the Gulfax character. The sentiment leans slightly more towards the positive side, as the user bought the movie and would consider watching a sequel."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the fact it was published in the early 80's...it's a little outdated on recommending good vintage years (at least for my pocketbook). It also has a chapter for selecting wines for a restaurant...great if you're a restauranteur, but not very useful if you buy wine for personal consumption. Other than that, highly recommended. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light with some minor reservations. The reviewer finds many positive aspects about Kevin's book, such as its concise yet comprehensive presentation of wine-making regions, wine types, and recommended wine/food pairings. They appreciate that it offers guidance on good vintage years, even if the information might be a bit outdated due to the book's publication in the early 80s. The reviewer also highlights the usefulness of the chapter focused on selecting wines for restaurants, but they note that this information might not be as relevant for those purchasing wine for personal consumption. This minor critique does not detract significantly from the overall favorable tone of the review. In general, the reviewer appears to highly recommend the book, despite not awarding it a full 5 stars. The minor drawbacks they mention do not seem to tarnish the overall value of the book as an introductory guide to wine, and the positive aspects they describe create a mostly flattering portrayal of the product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: In the early 2000s, Flash was widely installed on desktop computers, and was commonly used to display interactive web pages, online games, and to playback video and audio content. In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web. Between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals. Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network, Disney and Motorola. After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash , Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours. In 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player. After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focussing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation. In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy to convert Flash animation to HTML5, a tool Google would use to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices. In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on all devices, however it will preserve the Flash-based video player for older web browsers. Question: Why did Adobe stop developing Flash Player for Mobile? Answer:","completion":"Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile because there was a disagreement with Apple. Apple's iPhone and iPad did not support Flash Player. So, Adobe decided to focus on a different thing called Adobe AIR applications and making animations using something called HTML5, which worked nicely on phones and tablets. This was because HTML5 was a more flexible and modern way to show animations and videos on mobile devices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As part of providing a detailed answer, we will break this analysis into three specific components. 1. Clarity: The language used in this review is quite vague and unclear, as it does not provide any specific details about the issue or product in question. The question \\"Why many functions could not run\\" seems to inquire about the reasons for a possible malfunction or limitation. However, the lack of context makes it difficult for the reader to understand what functions or product this refers to. Clarity is an essential component of a helpful review, and in this case, it is significantly lacking. Clarity rating: 1 (least favorable). 2. Informativeness: An effective review generally provides valuable and insightful information to the reader, whether it's positive or negative feedback. However, this review doesn't offer any useful information about the product, nor on the specific issue the reviewer may be experiencing. As a reader, it is impossible to gauge the reviewer's concerns or recommendations without further details. Informativeness rating: 1 (least favorable). 3. Relevance: A high-quality and reliable review should be relevant to the product or service being reviewed to provide beneficial insights to the readers. In this case, due to the absence of specific context, it is almost impossible to determine the relevance of this review to a particular product or service. As a result, the potential relevance of the review cannot be assessed or considered. Relevance rating: 1 (least favorable). Overall rating: After evaluating the review in terms of clarity, informativeness, and relevance, an average rating can be derived. Since all three factors scored the least favorable rating of 1, the overall rating for this review can also be concluded as 1 (least favorable). The review is neither clear nor informative, and its relevance cannot be determined – leading the review to be unhelpful for a reader seeking useful information or insight for a product or service."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Kurt Friedrich Godel (UK: , US: ; German: ['kUat 'go:dl] ( listen); April 28, 1906 - January 14, 1978) was an Austrian, and later American, logician, mathematician, and philosopher. Godel was born April 28, 1906, in Brunn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) into the ethnic German family of Rudolf Godel (1874-1929), the manager of a textile factory, and Marianne Godel (nee Handschuh, 1879-1966). Throughout his life, Godel would remain close to his mother; their correspondence was frequent and wide-ranging. At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents. His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised Protestant. The ancestors of Kurt Godel were often active in Brunn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Godel was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the \\"Brunner Mannergesangverein\\". Godel automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I. According to his classmate Klepetar, like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenlander, \\"Godel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia\\". He chose to become an Austrian citizen at age 23. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Godel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen. In his family, young Kurt was known as Herr Warum (\\"Mr. Why\\") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Godel suffered from \\"frequent episodes of poor health,\\" which would continue for his entire life. Godel attended the Evangelische Volksschule, a Lutheran school in Brunn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand, Goethe's Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.

Yes Based on the provided context, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that Medesano is in Parma province which is in Emilia-Romagna which is in Italy. This conclusion can be arrived at by analyzing the given information in detail. Firstly, the context states that Medesano is a \\"comune\\" (municipality) in the Province of Parma. This confirms that Medesano is located within the Parma province, establishing the first part of the hypothesis as true. Secondly, the context informs us that Parma is in the Italian region Emilia-Romagna. This piece of information links Medesano not only to Parma but also to the larger region of Emilia-Romagna, making the second part of the hypothesis accurate. Lastly, the context specifies that both Bologna, which is 100 km southeast of Medesano, and Parma, which is 15 km northeast of Medesano, are situated in the country of Italy. This geographic description of Medesano's location relative to other known Italian cities further confirms its placement within the national boundaries of Italy.

We have this equation: -5222*m - 670537 = -179669. Our goal is to find what number 'm' is equal to. Just like finding the missing piece in a puzzle. Step 1: First, we need to get the \\"m\\" all by itself. There's a -670537 that we need to move away from the left side of the equation. To do that, we'll add 670537 to both sides of the equation (because -670537 + 670537 = 0).

So we have: (-5222*m) / -5222 = 490868 / -5222 Since -5222 divided by -5222 equals 1, we get: 1*m = -94 And that means: m = -94 So there you go!

There are several factors that contributed to this negative experience, which I will discuss in detail. **Atmosphere and Ambiance:** Upon entering The Mellow Meadow, I was left unimpressed by the ambiance. The place appeared cluttered and disorganized, and the noise level was quite distracting. The lighting was harsh and not suitable for a cozy atmosphere, making it impossible to feel at ease. The seating arrangements were cramped, leaving virtually no room for privacy or comfortable movement. Overall, the atmosphere failed to meet the standards set by an establishment that boasts a relaxing and enjoyable experience. **Food and Beverage:** Food is the heart of a great dining experience, and unfortunately, The Mellow Meadow fell short in various aspects. The menu lacked variety outside of a few mainstream selections. Many signature dishes were unavailable, claiming they were \\"out of stock\\" even though we dined during their peak hours. My order arrived cold and appeared overcooked, indicating an extended wait time from the kitchen to the table. Additionally, portions were meager in comparison to the relatively steep prices. The beverages and cocktails were mediocre at best. The drink choices were limited, and although the presentation was satisfactory, there was little else to be impressed about. My cocktail was predominantly filled with ice, diluting the already bland flavors, and by the time I received my drink, half of it had already melted away. **Service:** Regrettably, the subpar service significantly tainted my dining experience at The Mellow Meadow. The staff appeared to be untrained and, at times, overwhelmed. When taking orders, my server seemed uncertain about menu items and was unable to offer suitable recommendations. The wait time between placing the order and receiving the food was unreasonable, and empty glasses were never refilled. Furthermore, our requests for condiments, napkins, or additional utensils were either forgotten or took an incredible amount of time to be fulfilled. In addition, the bill was incorrect, and when we sought assistance in rectifying the error, the response was unapologetic and almost dismissive. It felt as if the employees were more eager to clear the tables and bring in new customers than to ensure that their current patrons were satisfied. **Cleanliness:** The overall cleanliness of The Mellow Meadow was lacking. As I mentioned earlier, the space felt cluttered and disorganized, but beyond that, there were visible smudges on the cutlery, fingerprints on the glassware, and crumbs scattered across the floor. The restrooms also left much to be desired in terms of hygiene and tidiness. In conclusion, my visit to The Mellow Meadow was a largely disappointing experience. The uninviting atmosphere, uninspiring food and beverages, poor service, and lack of cleanliness significantly marred my visit, leading me to conclude that this establishment is not worth the high price tag it carries. I cannot recommend The Mellow Meadow to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience; I encourage others to explore the many other wonderful options available in the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Emperor Zhang's (r. 75–88 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.

The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff., can you guess it ?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left? ? Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village harmed fewer corals? Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Hammond is the village that harmed fewer corals. This is because they decided to stop all sand mining operations a few months after starting to protect the environment.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] and the situation: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Answer the following question: Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas? Answer:","completion":"As a consequence of their agendas, Niger is likely to be more developed than Nigeria. Niger's focus on developing infrastructure and communications technology will have several positive effects on its development. Improved infrastructure facilitates better transportation, which in turn supports trade, economic growth, and accessibility to essential services and resources. Enhanced communications technology, on the other hand, connects people more efficiently and promotes the sharing of information, ideas, and opportunities, further boosting economic growth and development. In contrast, Nigeria's decision not to prioritize these areas may result in slower progress, decreased accessibility, and limited opportunities for its citizens to connect with the wider world or for businesses to readily trade internationally. As distance decay has less of an impact in areas with upgraded infrastructure and communication technologies, Niger would benefit more from the globalized world and maintain stronger economic and political relations with its neighbors and other international actors, putting it on a better development trajectory than Nigeria."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Morrison to say that 'coalition policies effectively stopped the boats' Speech comes just days after asylum seeker held on Manus Island died. Critics claim filthy conditions to blame for Iranian developing septiceamia.","completion":"Title: Immigration Minister Claims Coalition Policies Stopped the Boats Amidst Controversy Over Asylum Seeker's Death on Manus Island In a major speech to the National Press Club today, Immigration Minister Morrison is set to argue that the coalition government's policies have effectively halted the influx of illegal migrants arriving by boat. The timing of this statement is notable, as it comes just days after the death of a detained asylum seeker on Manus Island. Critics point to this tragedy as evidence that the government's policies are failing to protect the rights and well-being of those seeking asylum, with some claiming that the filthy conditions at the detention center are to blame for the Iranian man's death from septiceamia. Morrison intends to defend the coalition's policies during his speech today, stating that under their watch, the number of \\"boat arrivals\\" has decreased significantly. This is mainly due to the government's strict border control measures and the introduction of offshore processing centers - like the one on Manus Island - in which individuals who arrive illegally by boat are detained. Morrison is expected to argue that these measures demonstrate the government's commitment to protecting Australia's borders and ensuring the country's security. However, critics argue that such policies have come at the cost of the welfare and dignity of asylum seekers. The recent death of an Iranian man held on Manus Island highlights some of these concerns. Opponents of the government's policies claim that the man developed septiceamia - a life-threatening infection - due to the unsanitary conditions at the detention center. They maintain that this tragic incident could have been prevented if the government prioritized the well-being and humane treatment of asylum seekers over the enforcement of strict border policies. Furthermore, advocacy groups argue that the offshore processing centers themselves are inherently problematic as they often subject detainees to unacceptable living conditions, mental health issues, and limited access to legal resources. They contend that these centers also undermine Australia's international human rights obligations in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers. In light of these criticisms, Morrison's speech at the National Press Club today is poised to be the epicenter of a larger debate on Australia's immigration policy and the balance between border security and the humane treatment of those seeking asylum. While the immigration minister may argue that the coalition's policies have stopped the boats, opponents will continue to call for a more compassionate and just approach that prioritizes the welfare of the asylum seekers who remain in the country's care. In conclusion, the death of an asylum seeker on Manus Island has sparked renewed debate over the government's immigration policies and their impact on the well-being of those seeking refuge in Australia. As Immigration Minister Morrison defends the coalition's border control measures today, it's important to remember that the conversation surrounding immigration is multifaceted and requires a careful balancing of national security and the protection of human rights. Whether or not Australia can adopt a more compassionate approach in its immigration policy while maintaining its security remains to be seen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien, is a physician, epidemiologist, and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. His mother, Ruth O'Brien (nee Reardon), is a retired attorney and former partner at the Boston firm Ropes & Gray. O'Brien attended Brookline High School, where he served as the managing editor of the school newspaper, The Sagamore. Context: On Thursday, January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to get Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night, where O'Brien's ratings had collapsed before Leno's prime time series began. A proposal was made that would see O'Brien remain as host of The Tonight Show, which would be moved to 12:05 am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35 pm On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed end at the start of the Winter Olympics on February 12, 2010, and be moved to 11:35 pm following the Olympics coverage. Sources familiar with the situation told the New York Post that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan. On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \\"I sincerely believe that delaying The Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn't The Tonight Show.\\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit The Tonight Show the next day. The deal also granted him 45 million, of which 12 million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left Late Night. The final Tonight Show with Conan aired January 22, 2010, and featured guests Tom Hanks, Steve Carell (who did an exit interview and shredded Conan's ID badge), Neil Young (singing \\"Long May You Run\\"), and Will Ferrell. For Ferrell's appearance, Conan played guitar with the band and Ferrell sang \\"Free Bird\\" while reprising his SNL cowbell. Ferrell's wife, Viveca Paulin, together with Ben Harper, Beck, and ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, also joined the band for this final performance. Jay Leno returned to The Tonight Show following NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Under the 45 million deal with NBC, Conan was allowed to start working for another network as soon as September 2010. Conan's rumored next networks ranged anywhere from Fox to Comedy Central.

Q: Question: Conduction from the core has what effect on the lower mantle? Answer: it heats it A:","completion":"To come up with the answer that conduction from the core heats the lower mantle, I used the definition and understanding of heat conduction. Conduction refers to the transfer of heat energy between objects or regions in direct physical contact. The Earth's core consists of a solid inner core and a liquid outer core, both of which are significantly hot due to high pressure and radioactive decay. The lower mantle, which is a denser solid layer above the core, is directly in contact with the outer core. By considering the concept of heat conduction, we understand that heat from the hotter region (the core) will transfer to the cooler region (the lower mantle) through direct contact. This transfer of heat energy causes the temperature of the lower mantle to rise, thus getting heated by the conduction originating from the Earth's core."},{"prompt":"Choose from: (A). Yes. (B).

Write a text based on \\"tokyo stocks end up\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Tokyo Stocks Conclude on a High Note Tokyo's stock market experienced significant gains as it closed on a positive note today. This surge can be attributed to several factors, including promising economic data, global market trends, and investment behavior. Market experts and analysts weigh in on the possible implications of this upturn, as well as the future outlook for the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 1. Assessing economic data Recent economic figures released by the government highlight a steady recovery in the Japanese economy, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing and exports. The growth in these key areas has positively impacted investor confidence leading to a bullish trend in Tokyo stocks. 2. Examining global influences Tokyo's stock market has historically been sensitive to global economic shifts. In this case, the upward movement in stocks can also be linked to positive developments in other major markets such as the United States and Europe. As global trade partners continue to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, Tokyo stocks are set to benefit from improved international relations and trade policies. 3. Analyzing investment behavior The increased activity in the Tokyo stock market can be traced back to investors' renewed interest in the Japanese market. Many have shifted their focus back to domestic stocks, seeking opportunities in companies that are set to benefit from the government's efforts to revive the economy and bolster infrastructure. 4. Seeking expert opinions Prominent market analysts have also been voicing their optimism about the Tokyo stock market's upward trajectory. They note that the sustained growth in key industries and the country's commitment to investing in new technologies are likely to propel the market even higher in the near future. 5. Projecting future trends While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the overall sentiment surrounding Tokyo stocks appears to be predominantly positive. It is, however, essential for investors to remain prudent and carefully monitor market conditions, global events, and government policies for any potential shifts that may impact the stock market. In conclusion, the Tokyo stock market's recent upturn can be traced back to a combination of favorable economic data, global market trends, and investor behavior. As Japan's economy continues to recover and adapt to changing circumstances, the future of Tokyo stocks, for now, seems promising."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Her mother tells her a story of a person who wanted to see the ocean; then she explains that sometimes one must learn to see some things (through her mind's eye) without looking. The film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married young woman, trying to perceive some emotion from her husband Jatin. Jatin appears distant and shows little interest in Sita or in being married. Sita is given a perfunctory welcome by Jatin's family. Jatin is in a typical joint family arrangement. He lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his invalid mother (Biji) and the family servant Mundu. Their apartment is on the second floor of a two story dwelling in a crowded marketplace in New Delhi. Ashok and Jatin run a small store (on the first floor) that sells food (for takeout) and rents videotapes. Sita is gradually exposed to various difficulties. She is also in a typical arranged marriage, but she learns that Jatin married her only to put an end to Ashok's incessant nagging. Jatin continues to date his Chinese girlfriend. Sita does not rebuke him for fear that it may bring dishonour to her parents. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is paralysed and without speech after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to Biji (even her hygiene). Sita spends her days slaving in the hot and greasy kitchen, and she finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out dallying with his girlfriend. On the financial front, the store provides a modest income but their expenses are very high and they are unable to expand their business or buy a bigger home. Sita resignedly accepts these difficulties, but yearns to break out of this stifling and hopeless situation. It is later revealed that Radha faces a somewhat similar problem.

Die Unterstützung des Berichts, insbesondere des Punktes über den Wucher, kommt aus einer tief verwurzelten Leidenschaft, der Problematik des Wuchers entgegenzuwirken. Der Wucher bezieht sich auf die Praxis, exzessive oder unangemessen hohe Zinsen für Geldverleih zu erheben, was negative Auswirkungen sowohl auf Kreditnehmer als auch auf die Gesamtwirtschaft haben kann. In vielen Fällen kann Wucher dazu führen, dass Kreditnehmer in einen Teufelskreis geraten, bei dem sie immer höher verschuldet sind, weil sie Schwierigkeiten haben, die hohen Zinsen und Gebühren zu begleichen, die mit ihrem Kredit verbunden sind. Das kann häufig dazu führen, dass die finanzielle Situation des Kreditnehmers weiter verschlechtert wird, da sie gezwungen sind, weitere Schulden zu machen, um ihre bestehenden Verbindlichkeiten zu begleichen. In extremen Fällen können Kreditnehmer sogar ihren Arbeitsplatz, ihre Wohnung oder andere lebensnotwendige Ressourcen verlieren, weil sie nicht in der Lage sind, ihre Schulden zurückzuzahlen. Auf einer makroökonomischen Ebene kann Wucher auch negative Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Wirtschaft haben, da er oft eine Verlangsamung des Wirtschaftswachstums, eine Verzerrung von Marktmechanismen und die Ausbeutung von Verbrauchern fördert. All dies kann letztendlich zu einer Verschlechterung der Lebensbedingungen führen und Armut und Ungleichheit erhöhen. Aus diesen Gründen ist es wichtig, Maßnahmen gegen Wucher zu ergreifen und Ressourcen für die Bekämpfung dieser Praktiken bereitzustellen. Der Bericht, den ich unterstütze, enthält eine Reihe von Empfehlungen, die darauf abzielen, sowohl die Kreditnehmer als auch die Kreditgeber zu schützen und die Transparenz im Finanzmarkt zu erhöhen. Einige der empfohlenen Maßnahmen sind beispielsweise die Einführung von Obergrenzen für Zinsen und Gebühren, um die Kreditnehmer vor exzessiven Kosten zu schützen; die Schaffung von klareren und einfacheren Bedingungen für Kredite und Finanzprodukte; die Förderung von finanzieller Bildung, um die Verbraucher besser über ihre Rechte und Verantwortlichkeiten im Finanzmarkt zu informieren; sowie die Unterstützung von alternativen Kreditmodellen, wie beispielsweise Mikrokrediten und Gemeinschaftsbanken, die benachteiligten Bevölkerungsgruppen den Zugang zu Kapital ermöglichen. Die Enthusiastische Unterstützung des Berichts und insbesondere des Punktes über den Wucher zeigt ein tiefes Verständnis und eine feste Überzeugung, dass Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung von Wucher essenziell sind, um das finanzielle Wohlergehen von Einzelpersonen, Familien und der Gesellschaft als Ganzes zu fördern und eine gerechtere und nachhaltigere Wirtschaft zu schaffen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.

'He's married, so he's (enjoying some things that he wasn't experiencing before he's married),' he said. 'For a man, that could definitely help him out... He walks around with a little more swagger, which is something that we need, which is something that we love.' Scroll down for video. Wedded bliss: Prince Amukamara, a devout Christian who said he wanted to abstain from sex until marriage, wed wife Pilar earlier this year and since, he has been playing better than ever. Whatever the cause, it's paying off. In four games, Amukamara, who was picked in the first round of the 2011 draft, has already set a career high with two interceptions, as well as 25 tackles. 'When he goes out there playing, you definitely see him being more aggressive, capitalizing on his opportunities and he's accepting challenges. He's winning those challenges,' Rolle said. His coaches said that the 25-year-old has shown steady improvement in his four-year career. 'Prince is a young man who's improved year in and year out,' coach Tom Coughlin said last week. 'And he's improved this past year to this point.' He would not say outright that having sex was responsible for his latest boost. Success: Amukamara breaks up a pass against Andre Johnson of the Houston Texans on September 21. New man: The couple, who met three years ago, married in Phoenix, Arizona a week after the Super Bowl. Together: They met at a Manhattan nightclub and he initially did not tell Pilar that he was a footballer player. 'He's just developing more as a man and accepting challenges and being the dominant player that we need him to be that we know he's capable of,' Coughlin said. Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, has always been open about waiting for marriage before having sex. He also does not drink alcohol. In an interview with Muscle & Fitness last year, he revealed that his clean lifestyle led some of his teammates to call him 'the black Tim Tebow' after his fellow Christian NFL player. He met his now-wife Pilar in a Manhattan nightclub three years ago. In the interview, he said that even though his friends were encouraging him to talk to her, he wasn't sure what to say. Later on, she walked past and he stated talking with her. 'I asked her for her e-mail address because when someone asks for your number, it might be too personal and you might not want to give it,' he said. 'But if you ask for their e-mail address, they'll give it. I was right.' Beautiful: Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, said he was immediately drawn to Pilar when he saw her. Happy: The couple, seen at the Spider Man premiere, married in Phoenix, Arizona a week after the Super Bowl. But he admitted that he initially hid his job from her. He told the magazine that he has pretended to be a construction worker or a manager at Gap when meeting people in the past - and one teammate has even claimed to be an astronaut. He added that he realized he had to tell Davis the truth when the Giants went to San Francisco for the conference championship. He knew he would have to come clean if he wanted her to visit him. 'So two days later, I said \\"Hey, I play for the Giants\\",' he recalled. 'She thought I meant San Francisco Giants. That's when I thought she might be a keeper.' He proposed to her on stage at a Jabbawockeez show at Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 19 last year and they married in Phoenix, Arizona in February. See below for video.

Andrew Gary Johns (born 19 May 1974) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer of the 1990s and 2000s. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. Hailed as the best halfback in the world for many years, he captained the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League and participated in the team's only two premiership victories in 1997 and 2001, playing a club record 249 games for the Knights. Johns also represented his country at two World Cups, and on one Kangaroo tour, playing in total 21 Test matches for the national side. On 26 August 2007 Johns was arrested for fare evasion on the London Underground, and subsequently found to be in possession of one ecstasy tablet. He was cautioned and released with no further charges. Johns initially claimed that an unknown person had pushed the tablet into his pocket which he later forgot to remove before leaving the crowded venue. This initial statement was met with a great deal of cynicism from both the press and the public. On 30 August, Johns revealed, live on the Footy Show, that he had regularly taken ecstasy throughout his playing career, mainly during the off-season. He claimed he had suffered from depression and bipolar disorder and the drugs helped him in dealing with the high level of psychological 'pressure' associated with his career as an elite sportsman. Not long after the incident he released his 'tell-all' autobiography that went into further details regarding his depression and drug use while playing in the NRL. The ARU released a press statement shortly after the controversy arose, stating that Johns' drug use was known to the ARU and was a key factor in its decision to not proceed with contractual negotiations in 2004. Brett Robinson, then high-performance unit manager, said that, as well as Johns' age and injury history, the knowledge of his drug taking had been influential in the ARU making its final decision. When Johns was named the Best Player of the Last 30 Years in early 2008, the accolade allayed concern that Johns' shock drug admission the year before had tarnished his remarkable efforts on the field for Newcastle, NSW and Australia. On receiving the award he was quoted as saying his health was now in great shape. \\"I'm at the best place I have been in a long time,\\" he said. \\"It's not until you step away that I realise all the pressure I was under, I'm not going to miss playing at all.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did this have an impact on his career?","completion":"Yes, the incident had an impact on his career.

When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father re-entered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments. Durant has one sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne. Context: Prior to the start of the 2010-11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately 86 million. For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game. Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games. On February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets. At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title. Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed. In Game 1 of the first round against the Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining. Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the Finals. For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate. With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012-13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50-40-90 club. Finishing the year with a 60-22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason. Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility, averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs, but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, indeed the article is full of a plethora of interesting aspects. 1. Durant's Early Life: Born in Washington, D.C., Durant lived through challenging family circumstances. His father left when he was an infant, and consequently, he was primarily raised by his mother and grandmother. Despite this, by age 13, Durant's father re-entered his life and supported his passion for basketball by travelling with him to different tournaments. This shows Durant's resilience and early exposure to basketball that might have played an instrumental role in shaping his future career. 2. Durant’s Contract Extension: A vital aspect discussed in the article is Durant’s extension of the contract with the Thunder for approx 86 million for five years in the 2010-11 season. This presents Durant's commitment to his team and his rising market value as a supremely skilled player. 3. His Brilliant Performances: Durant's exceptional skill as a player is underscored by his consistent performances. His prolific scoring record made him lead the NBA in scoring for two consecutive years. He scored his career-first 50-point game in the 2011-12 season, and remarkably, he maintained an average of 28 points per game in three straight seasons. 4. His Leadership: Durant led his team, the Thunder, to win 55 games, earning the fourth seed in the Western Conference. Despite the defeat in the Conference Finals, his leadership noteworthy. 5. Durant's Recognition: Durant's significant contributions were recognized when he was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. In the NBA Finals, he led all players scoring an average of 30.6 points per game, a testament to his striking abilities as a scorer. 6. Achievements: One of the most interesting aspects is Durant's entry to the 50-40-90 club – these numbers refer to a shooting percentage of 50% for field goals, 40% for three-pointers, and 90% for free throws, in a single season. At a young age, he achieved this remarkable feat, showcasing his excellent scoring proficiency. 7. Challenges Faced: The article highlights Durant's career's challenging phase when his key teammate, Russell Westbrook, suffered an injury during the 2012-13 playoffs. This incident resulted in Durant assuming more responsibilities. Even though they were eventually eliminated, Durant's phenomenal performance with a career-high average of 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs was impressive, once again showing his ability to rise to the occasion and lead the team. In summary, the article offers a compelling look into Kevin Durant's early life, his relentless passion for basketball, outstanding performances, the achievements that he bagged at a young age, and the resilience he showed when faced with adversity. His journey, as documented in the article, is an interesting study of a sports figure who's much more than just his on-court performances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The first sentence describes a South Africa meridionalis, which is a small jumping spider that inhabits Tanzania. Jumping spiders are part of the Salticidae family and are characterized by their ability to jump relatively long distances in comparison to their body size. They typically have well-developed vision and are considered active hunters. The sentence clearly states that this particular species is found in Tanzania, which is a country located in East Africa. The second sentence, on the other hand, refers to a Tanzania meridionalis, which is a small diving spider that resides in South Africa. Diving spiders belong to the Cybaeidae family and are known for their unique hunting behavior that involves diving underwater to catch their prey. They possess specialized adaptations that enable them to survive both on land and in water.

Given the below context: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

The Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257-1259 was a revolt of the Principality of Arbanon against the Empire of Nicaea and in favour of the rival Despotate of Epirus. Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durrë, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of Devol. After suffering heavy losses, the Byzantines were finally able to control the situation, but in the years 1260-1270 the Albanian rulers revolted again in the region of Durrës.

Amin in 1946 joined the King's African Rifles, a British colonial regiment, serving in Kenya and Uganda. Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Uganda People's Defense Force and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971 that deposed Milton Obote. While he was head of state, he promoted himself to field marshal. - The Ugandan Bush War (also known as the Luwero War, the Ugandan civil war or the Resistance War) refers to the guerrilla war waged between 1981 and 1986 in Uganda by the National Resistance Army (NRA) under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni against the government of Milton Obote, and later that of Tito Okello. - Apollo Milton Obote (28 December 1925 10 October 2005) was a Ugandan political leader who led Uganda to independence in 1962 from British colonial administration. Following the nation's independence, he served as Prime Minister of Uganda from 1962 to 1966 and President of Uganda from 1966 to 1971, then again from 1980 to 1985. He was overthrown by Idi Amin in 1971, but regained power after Amin's 1979 overthrow. His second period of rule was marred by repression and the deaths of many civilians as a result of a civil war known as the Ugandan Bush War. - Commander (French: \\"Commandeur\\") is a common naval and air force officer rank. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organisations, including several police forces. - The King's African Rifles (KAR) was a multi-battalion British colonial regiment raised from Britain's various possessions in British East Africa in the present-day African Great Lakes region from 1902 until independence in the 1960s. It performed both military and internal security functions within the colonial territory, and later served outside these territories during the World Wars. The rank and file (askaris) were drawn from native inhabitants, while most of the officers were seconded from the British Army. When the KAR was first raised there were some Sudanese officers in the battalions raised in Uganda, and native officers were commissioned towards the end of British colonial rule. - Robert \`\` Bob '' Astles ( born Robert Asketill , 23 March 1924 -- 29 December 2012 ) was a British soldier and colonial officer who lived in Uganda and became an associate of presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin . - Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world.

She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her. ||||| FILE - In this July 14, 1999 file photo, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is adorned with his signature feather boa and glitter sunglasses by professional wrestler Chyna, during a World Wrestling Federation... (Associated Press) REDONDO BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Chyna, the WWE star who in the 1990s became one of the best-known and most-popular female professional wrestlers in history, has died, authorities said. Police in Southern California said they were responding to a 911 call from a friend of former WWE wrestler Chyna when they found her dead in her Redondo Beach apartment. A friend had gone Wednesday to check on Chyna, whose real name is Joan Marie Laurer, after she had failed to answer her phone for a few days, Redondo Beach police said in a statement. The friend told the 911 operator that Laurer wasn't breathing. The 46-year-old Laurer was dead when officers arrived, police said. Several media outlets report that she was 45. Neither police nor coroner's officials have released any cause of death. A coroner's investigator was still at the location with the body late Wednesday night, according to Los Angeles County coroner's Lt. Larry Dietz. He said he had no further information on the death. The tall, muscle-bound, raven-haired Laurer billed herself as the \\"9th Wonder of the World\\" because her wrestling predecessor Andre the Giant had already called himself the eighth. She was a member of the wrestling squad that dubbed itself \\"D-Generation X,\\" often wrestled against men and at one point was the WWE women's champion. On her official website a statement posted Wednesday night reads, \\"Today we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th Wonder of the World has passed away. She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her.\\" Laurer was a native of Rochester, New York and graduated from the University of Tampa in Florida before taking up wrestling. She joins a long list of WWE professional wrestlers who have died relatively young, including Rick Rude, Curt \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Hennig, the Ultimate Warrior and Owen Hart. After leaving the WWE in 2001, Laurer posed for Playboy and appeared in adult films and on reality TV, including the shows \\"The Surreal Life\\" and \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.\\" ___ This story has been updated to reflect that Laurer was 46, according to a police statement. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Chyna, a famous female wrestler from the 1990s, has sadly passed away.

Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald. Describing her 1950 exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, one critic considered it \\"one of the most stimulating and refreshing that has been seen here for a long time\\" and that \\"She paints with a strong, sombre palette and her forms are sculptured with great decision.

Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Now, I have a new situation: Sarah just finished reheating two leftover chicken sandwiches in the microwave that she had made the previous night. She takes them out and leaves them on the kitchen counter while she pours herself a glass of wine. Her roommate, Carla, comes out and decides to take a more scientific approach toward the chicken sandwiches. Carla sees that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than the average kinetic energy in sandwich B. Carla then takes a big bite out of both sandwiches and returns to her room as if nothing happened. Answer this question please: Which sandwich was in the microwave for a longer period of time? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Sandwich A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sandwich B. Since temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the matter, it means that Sandwich A has a higher temperature than Sandwich B.

As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below. Answer:","completion":"Point E would have a lower frequency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Those who focus mainly on their career are probably: Options: A. As stressed as most people B. Less stressed than most people C. More stressed than most people D. not enough information A:","completion":"C. More stressed than most people The context provided indicates that individuals who have an all-consuming focus on their career often experience a chaotic lifestyle that does not produce the happiness they hoped to achieve and that professional burnout from chronic stress can have debilitating effects. On the other hand, living a balanced life filled with varied experiences has been found to potentially provide incredible benefits. The overall message of the passage suggests that those who focus mainly on their career are more likely to experience higher levels of stress than those who pursue a more balanced lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How early Twitter decisions led to Weiner's downfall Twitter was a simple idea but settings had to be just right, like the proper temperature for a soufflÃ©. Should the rules be very restrictive, to preserve privacy and intimacy? (Too much restriction would make the service less useful.) Or should they be expansive, and invite a wide circle to share one's status reports? (Too broad a channel would mean a depersonalized cohort.) The breakthrough that enabled Twitter to become the wildly successful service it is now came from a twist that was much more significant than even its founders knew: They made it possible to \\"follow\\" someone's messages without requiring permission. Essentially you would take out a subscription to someone's Twitter stream. You would follow your best friend or your brother in the same way you would follow Barack Obama, DeSean Jackson or the New York Times. This was a break from the traditional two-way agreement that ruled communications in previous social systems. This changed Twitter from an asynchronous instant messaging system into a hybrid of a social network and broadcast medium. \\"The relationship model was something that we debated a lot,\\" says Evan Williams, who headed the company (Odeo) that created Twitter. \\"In the first version, by default you were private.\\" (This quote is from a conversation I had with Williams in 2009, when I was working on a story for Wired.) But then Dorsey's team came up with the idea that you could follow someone without them following you. \\"That was really important,\\" says Williams. \\"From my perspective, I wanted something like a blog relationship model. What I thought was beautiful about blogs as opposed to e-mail or anything else is it's completely up to the recipient of the information whether or not they consume it.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. Twitter's early decision-making focused on balancing privacy and intimacy with utility and a broad user base. 2. A key breakthrough for Twitter was allowing users to \\"follow\\" others without requiring permission, turning it into a hybrid of a social network and broadcast medium. 3. Evan Williams, the head of the company that created Twitter, emphasized the importance of the \\"follow\\" feature and wanted a similar relationship model to blogs, where users can choose whether or not to consume the content. 4.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did.

He claimed his rights were violated when he was moved to a \\"prison within a prison\\" at HMP Belmarsh, amid fears he was mounting an escape bid. Mr Justice Bean ruled it was a \\"reasonable\\" decision at the time. Gunn, 47, made millions as the gangland ruler of the Bestwood estate in Nottingham until he was jailed for conspiracy to murder in 2006. The Stirlands were found shot dead at their bungalow in Trusthorpe in a revenge killing after Mrs Stirland's son killed an associate of the Gunn family. In May 2013, he was transferred from HMP Frankland in County Durham to what was described by a national newspaper as a \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"-style cell. The court heard Gunn had arranged for an inmate to pass a note to a prison officer on which was written the address of the officer's disabled brother, telling him, \\"Well, you now work for me and Colin Gunn\\". Gunn's barrister, Philip Rule, argued that the four months in top security unlawfully interfered with his ability to receive visitors and therefore his right to respect for private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. The judge said that \\"it was a reasonable decision at the time\\", and ordered Gunn to pay Â£1,000 towards the government's legal costs.

In jail, he was being naughty, so they had to move him to a more secure part of the prison because they were scared he might try to escape. They moved him to a really really strong part of the prison which was also like a prison within a big prison. Within the jail, Colin was able to get a note to one of the people who worked in jail, trying to scare them to work for him. This added to the reasons why they had to keep him in the stronger part of the prison. Now Colin's lawyer, a man named Philip Rule, was upset that Colin was kept in the stronger part of prison because it was really hard for Colin's friends and family to visit him there. The lawyer thought this was not fair and good for Colin's personal and family life. The judge, who is like the boss in court, said that it was okay and the right thing to move Colin to the more secure part of the prison considering his behavior.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Please answer the following question: Information: - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today. - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Metal Blade Records is a heavy metal record label founded by Brian Slagel in 1982.

The label is distributed in the U.S. by RED Distribution, and in Canada by Sony Music Entertainment. It was distributed by Warner Bros. Records in the United States from 1988 to 1993. - ( Pitch.Black.Effects ) is the fifth and final studio album by the extreme metal band Callenish Circle . - Callenish Circle was an extreme metal band from the Netherlands. They recorded three of their albums for Metal Blade Records, and broke up in February 2007. In the early 2000s things were going well for the band. In 2002 they toured with God Dethroned, played at the Dutch version of Ozzfest and the German Party San Open Air, and opened for Dimmu Borgir. Their fourth album was released by Metal Blade in 2003; to support it they played that year's Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze festivals in Germany, and in October they were part of the Bonded By Metal Over Europe-tour, headlined by Exodus, Nuclear Assault, and Agent Steel. In 2006 they toured Mexico (cited by the band as the high point of their career), before they decided to break up in 2007. - Wacken Open Air (W:O:A) is a summer open-air heavy metal music festival. It takes place annually in the small village of Wacken in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With 80,000 festival visitors, and including personnel a total of roughly 86,000 attendees in 2011, it attracts various kinds of metal and hard rock music fans. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. What is the relationship between 'pitch.black.effects' and 'metal blade records'?

Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day.

Movie title: Django Unchained Context: In 1858, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, is chained to a bunch of other slaves and being marched to his new owner's estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky's horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky's leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck's horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee. As Django and Schultz ride off, we hear Speck pleading for his life. We hear a gunshot and can see blood splatter as Dicky's brains are blown out.Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso. As they travel through the streets, townspeople stop to stare in disbelief at the sight of a nigger on a horse, much to Schultz's confusion. As Schultz ties his cart down at a hitching post, he checks some papers to make sure he's in the right place. The two then walk into a saloon despite the fact that Django is forbidden from doing so because he is black due to the South's segregation laws. When Schultz insists on being served, the barkeep runs out of the saloon, Schultz calling after him to specifically... Answer:","completion":"In Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film \\"Django Unchained,\\" the character you are referring to is Stephen, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Stephen is a loyal house slave to Calvin Candie, the cruel owner of the Candieland plantation, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The film follows Django, a freed slave, and Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter, as they work together to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), from the clutches of Candie. Stephen is a complex and controversial character within the narrative, as he is a loyal servant to his master, despite being a black slave himself. He is portrayed as an elderly and cunning man, who has significant influence within the Candieland plantation and exerts control over the other slaves. This gives him a certain degree of power, though still subservient to his white master. Stephen is highly observant and often acts as the voice of reason for Calvin Candie, which further highlights his loyalty and influence within the household. He becomes suspicious of Django and Dr. Schultz's intentions and plays a pivotal role in unraveling their plan to rescue Broomhilda. This proves his unwavering loyalty to Calvin and the plantation, as he would rather protect his master's interests than help his fellow slaves in gaining their freedom. As the film develops, it becomes evident that Stephen is as much a villain as his white counterparts, deriving power and a sense of control from his position within the plantation's hierarchy. His character is a representation of the internalized racism and self-preservation that existed among some slaves during the 19th century. In conclusion, Calvin's loyal house slave in \\"Django Unchained\\" is Stephen, a character portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Through his deceitful actions and loyalty to Calvin Candie, he represents the complexities and internalized racism that existed within some enslaved individuals during this period in American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. and a hint : Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche. Please answer this question : Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil? Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, the farmer with grasslands would observe a greater buildup of calcium in the soil. In this case, that would be Bill. The reasoning behind this is the precipitation in grasslands being equal to or less than evapotranspiration, which creates a relatively drought-like environment. This reduced leaching and migration of weathering products leads to decreased soil development. The large amounts of evaporation in grasslands cause the buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations, which flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. The impermeable clay layer then limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. Consequently, when leaching is decreased in grasslands, calcium precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, forming a layer known as caliche.

Question: __ is a religious obligation for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth Context: Belief is a fundamental aspect of morality in the Quran, and scholars have tried to determine the semantic contents of \\"belief\\" and \\"believer\\" in the Quran. The ethico-legal concepts and exhortations dealing with righteous conduct are linked to a profound awareness of God, thereby emphasizing the importance of faith, accountability, and the belief in each human's ultimate encounter with God. People are invited to perform acts of charity, especially for the needy. Believers who \\"spend of their wealth by night and by day, in secret and in public\\" are promised that they \\"shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\\". It also affirms family life by legislating on matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. A number of practices, such as usury and gambling, are prohibited. The Quran is one of the fundamental sources of Islamic law (sharia). Some formal religious practices receive significant attention in the Quran including the formal prayers (salat) and fasting in the month of Ramadan. As for the manner in which the prayer is to be conducted, the Quran refers to prostration. The term for charity, zakat, literally means purification.

In the afternoon he arrives in the small rural town of Hickory and enters the high school. He notices, on a shelf in the hall, basketball trophies won in previous years. As the bell rings to end the school day, he encounters teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). She realizes that Norman must be the new basketball coach and teacher of history and civics. She directs him to the office of principal Cletus Summers (Sheb Wooley), where the two men recall how they met many years ago at Buffalo State Teachers College. They had lost touch until recently, when Cletus tracked down Norman and asked him to come coach at Hickory.

Please answer the following question: Q: Why are eutherian mammals sometimes called placental mammals? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Eutherians are the most widespread of the mammals, occurring throughout the world. There are several groups of eutherians, including Insectivora, the insect eaters; Edentata, the toothless anteaters; Rodentia, the rodents; Chiroptera, the bats; Cetacea, the aquatic mammals including whales; Carnivora, carnivorous mammals including dogs, cats, and bears; and Primates, which includes humans. Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals, because all species have a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, waste, and nutrient exchange. While other mammals may possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta, all eutherians have a complex placenta during gestation. Primates Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and the apes, which include humans. Non-human primates live primarily in tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species. All primate species have adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers, although not all species are arboreal. This arboreal heritage of primates resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation, or climbing and swinging through trees. These adaptations include, but are not limited to 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs that are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, and 3) stereoscopic vision, two overlapping visual fields, which allows for the depth perception necessary to gauge distance. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of many other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a...

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.

Q: Article: Agricultural experts met in Ethiopia last week to discuss ways to help sub-Saharan Africa become a major producer of wheat. The area traditionally produced little wheat, while North Africa was the grain basket. Wheat production fell sharply in sub-Saharan countries during the 1980s. In the 1960s, attempts were made to grow wheat in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe. But those countries found it was less costly to import wheat from Europe and the United States. Another problem is that Africa's wheat farms were often far from population centers. There also were transportation issues. And some lowlands were not a good place to grow wheat. Hans Joachim Braun,one of the experts, says now is a good time to increase wheat production. In the last four years we have seen three major price hikes, where the wheat price and other staple process exploded. And that puts a big, big bill on countries which are depending on wheat imports, and Africa is the biggest wheat importer. He also says demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than for any other crop. With higher income people would like to have more diversified food. But that is possible not the most important one. The most important one is that there is a tremendous migration of in particular male labor to the cities. And wheat products are convenient food because you can easily buy it. It's easy to process and you also can store it for a few days, which is different from some of the maize and rice products. There are three possible challenges for growing more wheat in Africa: climate change, disease and pests, like insects. Mr. Braun says rising temperatures should not have a major effect on wheat. In fact, he says, it could help wheat grow in areas with high rainfall totals. As for fighting disease and pests, experts suggest growing more resistant crops. In addition, railroads and roads would have to be improved so large amounts of wheat could be moved to large markets. Question: Wheat price exploding indicates _ .

When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth.

This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool, staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquitos, Florida is no paradise to me, I itch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City, Florida.

Article: What else did this wild day need? How about a halfcourt buzzer-beater? You got it. Your newest N.C.A.A. tournament highlight arrives courtesy of Northern Iowa’s Paul Jesperson, whose heave as time expired gave the 11th-seeded Panthers the upset win over No. 6 Texas. The game was tied with three seconds remaining by Texas’s Isaiah Taylor, whose jumper appeared to force overtime. But Northern Iowa scrambled to get the ball in — declining to use its last timeout — and Jesperson found the ball in his hands. He banked the game-winning 3-pointer in from just about half-court to win it, 75-72. Thus ended a fantastic game in Oklahoma City that featured multiple lead changes in the final minutes. It was an uncomfortable matchup for the Longhorns. The Panthers, who do not have a starter taller than 6 feet 9 inches tall, like to spread the floor, work the shot clock down, and open up driving lanes to the hoop. Northern Iowa led by as much as 16 in the first half after going on a 23-2 run. Texas responded by opening the second half on a 17-3 run. Taylor (22 points) got hot, and the Longhorns regained a lead as large as five. But the Panthers, no strangers to N.C.A.A. tournament success, battled back, with balanced scoring across its starting five. In three of the Panthers’ last four wins, the score was in the 50s, but Texas’s offense was too explosive to keep quieted. Northern Iowa, however, finished with the shot of the night. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Associated Press) The Latest on the second full day of the men's NCAA Tournament, including games being played in St. Louis; Spokane, Washington; New York; and Oklahoma City (All times EDT): 5:20 p.m. Quenton Decosey made what were probably the biggest free throws of his life. Decosey was fouled shooting a 3 by Anthony Clemmon with 2.1 seconds left in the game and Iowa up by 3. Decosey made the first two and Iowa called timeout. He stepped up and made the last one to tie the score at 63. Iowa threw the ball away with a long pass and the Owls had one more shot with 1.3 seconds left but did not get a shot off. — Ralph Russo reporting from Brooklyn ___ 5:15 p.m. If Michigan State losing isn't enough to prove the wackiness of this March, digest this: Lower-seeded teams are 11-9 in the NCAA Tournament through the first 20 games. The Spartans' loss busted national title picks in roughly one-quarter of brackets picked by Yahoo! and ESPN users. ___ 5:05 p.m. Brackets busted: 27.3 percent of brackets in Yahoo! pools and 22.3 percent in ESPN pools had Michigan State winning it all. Only Kansas was a more popular choice. ___ 4:50 p.m. With Hawaii upsetting California, the Pac-12 fell to 1-5 in the first round with Oregon still left to play. The Ducks are a 1 seed facing Holy Cross, which made the field with a losing record as Patriot League Tournament champions. Utah is the only Pac-12 team to advance so far. The league's seven representatives were tied for the most of any conference in the 68-team field. ___ 4:40 p.m. Idaho is warming up before its first-round game in the women's NCAA Tournament at No. 1 seed Baylor. No surprise that the Vandals almost immediately are taking shots from long range. Baylor and Idaho both have the same 37.1 shooting percentage on 3-pointers. But the Vandals have made more 3-pointers than the Big 12 champion Lady Bears have even attempted this season. \\"They've made more 3s than I'll probably ever let my team shoot in the time I'm at Baylor,\\" said coach Kim Mulkey, whose Lady Bears open NCAA play on their home court for the fourth year in a row. Idaho is second nationally with 341 made 3-pointers this season, trailing only Sacramento State's 386. Baylor is tied for 298th with its 118 made 3s. — Stephen Hawkins reporting from Waco, Texas. ___ 4:20 p.m. Temple and Villanova are part of Philadelphia's storied Big Five in basketball, with La Salle, St. Joseph's and Penn. The prospects of a Big Five matchup between Temple and Villanova in Sunday's second round had Wildcats coach Jay Wright feeling some mixed emotions. \\"Growing up in Philly, every time I coach in one of those games, I've got to pinch myself that I'm in it,\\" he said after the first-round win against UINC Asheville. \\"In Philadelphia, that's like an Auburn-Alabama -- it's like living in Alabama and playing an Auburn-Alabama football game. That's what those games are like. But on the other side, the coaches are really good friends, and I hate coaching against my friends.\\" Fran Dunphy and Temple were down 38-37 at halftime to Iowa. — Ralph Russo reporting from New York ___ 3:40 p.m. You'd think Michigan State's Denzel Valentine would get a little respect these days. Not from the public address announcer at the Scottrade Center. He made a habit of calling the Big Ten player of the year \\"Darnell Valentine\\" in the first half of the second-seeded Spartans' game against No. 15 seed Middle Tennessee State on Friday. Either the man behind the mike was making an honest mistake or he was showing his age: Darnell Valentine was an All-American guard for Kansas in the 1970s and '80s who went on to spend several years with the Trail Blazers, Clippers and Cavaliers before retiring from basketball. Chances are Denzel Valentine will have an NBA future, too. — Dave Skretta reporting from St. Louis. ___ 3:35 p.m. California's Jabari Bird is back on the Golden Bears' bench for the second half after the school said he had back spasms during pregame warmups. Bird was evaluated and received treatment in the locker room during the first half and rejoined his teammates after halftime. California was already without starting point guard and leading scorer Tyrone Wallace after he broke his right hand in practice this week. __ Tim Booth reporting from Spokane, Washington ___ 2:55 p.m. Cal State Bakersfield's Rod Barnes has no choice but to revisit one of his worst coaching memories. He was an assistant coach at Mississippi in 1998, when Valparaiso's Bryce Drew hit the famous 3-pointer to help the 13th-seeded Crusaders upset the 4th-seeded Rebels in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Mississippi led 69-67 with 2.5 seconds left before Drew's buzzer-beater. That game was played at the Myriad, which is now the Cox Convention Center. Eighteen years later, Barnes' 15th-seeded Roadrunners play across the street at Chesapeake Energy Arena against No. 2 seed Oklahoma. Drew's shot gets replayed whenever March Madness rolls around, and the location of this year's game makes the memory even clearer for Barnes. \\"Every year, you try to live it down,\\" Barnes said. \\"It's kind of like pulling the scab off an injury __ it keeps coming right back. So hopefully, we can get here this year and have better memories, as far as the tournament goes.\\" Barnes became head coach at Mississippi later that year and held that position until 2006. He was an assistant at Oklahoma for a year and led the Georgia State program from 2007 to 2011 before taking the job at Bakersfield. Still, the memory of Drew's shot has remained vivid. \\"Man, my heart still hurts,\\" he said. — Cliff Brunt, reporting from Oklahoma City. ___ 2:30 p.m. California standout Jabari Bird is not on the Golden Bears bench and is apparently sick. Bird was listed as a starter for the Bears, but was replaced in the lineup against Hawaii by Jordan Mathews. The television broadcast reported that Bird was in the locker room not feeling well. Bird averaged 10.4 points per game. It's another blow in an already tumultuous week for California that's seen the Bears dismiss an assistant coach amid sexual harassment allegations and lose top scorer Tyrone Wallace for the season to a broken hand. —Tim Booth reporting from Spokane, Washington. ___ 1:55 p.m. This goes beyond brunch-time basketball. Hawaii is used to playing at odd times during the season, but Friday's NCAA Tournament opener against No. 4 seed California is early for even the most ardent hoops fan on the islands, with a scheduled tip of 8 a.m. in Honolulu. That's 11 a.m. Pacific time. While that is an adjustment for the Warriors fans back home, the team itself had no problem getting ready for the early tip. Hawaii's been on the mainland since March 1 when it left for the final two games of the Big West regular season before winning the conference tournament in Anaheim, California, and then making the trip north to Spokane, Washington. —Tim Booth reporting from Spokane, Washington. ___ 1:30 p.m. Villanova found its range from 3-point range late in the first half to build a comfortable lead at the break against 15th-seeded UNC Asheville. It was a 4-point lead for the Wildcats with 3 minutes left in the half, but they hit 3s on their last four trips. The last one by Ryan Arcidiacono was a pull-up that barely beat the buzzer and made it 40-26 for the second-seed. Villanova had been 3 for 11 from 3 against the Asheville zone before hitting their last four. —Ralph Russo reporting from New York. ___ 11:55 a.m. UConn women's coach Geno Auriemma says the burden of living each year for the three weeks of the NCAA Tournament wears on him, but he's not yet ready to hang up his whistle. Auriemma, who will turn 62 on March 23, begins his 28th straight NCAA tournament on Saturday against 16th-seed Robert Morris, hoping to lead the Huskies to an 11th national championship and a fourth straight. Robert Morris coach Sal Buscaglia has announced that he will retire at the end of the season, ending a 38-year coaching career. Auriemma, who is in his 31st year at UConn, said that got him thinking about how long he will continue to coach. \\"I kind of got up this morning to come here today and I can't say it was exactly like it was 28 years ago, but it's not that much different,\\" he said. \\"So, as long as that is the case, I'm good for a while.\\" —Pat Eaton-Robb reporting from Storrs, Connecticut. ___ 11:54 a.m. Bettors at a chain of Las Vegas sports books seem particularly enamored with Dayton on the second day of the NCAA Tournament. The game between Dayton and Syracuse was the most heavily bet game of the day early Friday at the William Hill sports books. The game was drawing 17 percent of all money, topping the Hawaii-California game (10 percent) as the biggest draw of the day. Dayton was favored by 54 percent of bettors as a one-point underdog. But 77 percent of the total money bet on the game was on the Flyers, meaning the bigger bettors liked Dayton most of all. Bettors also believed Oklahoma would open its bid for a national title with a big game. The Sooners were 15-point favorites over Cal State Bakersfield, but 83 percent of the tickets written were on Oklahoma, and 93 percent of the money favored the Sooners to cover the big spread. —Tim Dahlberg reporting from Las Vegas ___ 11:15 a.m. Some small-school nets are getting a chance to shine on college basketball's biggest stage. The ones sent to St. Louis for the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament were found to be longer than regulation Friday, setting off a frantic search across the city for replacements. Missouri Valley associate commissioner Jack Watkins, tournament director for the site, told The Associated Press that regulation nets were found at Fontbonne University. The Division III school is located about 15 minutes west of the Scottrade Center. The nets were strung up after Wisconsin completed an early walk-through, only 15 minutes before the Badgers and Syracuse began warming up. —Dave Skretta reporting from St. Louis. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In an exciting NCAA tournament game, Northern Iowa's Paul Jesperson made a half-court buzzer-beater, giving the 11th-seeded Panthers an upset win over No. 6 Texas.

They are noted for their high energy live concerts, movie soundtrack contributions, and their mixture of genre, which can be described as including ska, pop, rock, and world music. The band was founded in 1972 as The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, a performance art group. The band was led by songwriter/vocalist Danny Elfman, who has since achieved success as a composer for film and television. With the move to MCA, the band made two personnel switches: Mike Bacich took over on keyboards from departing member Richard Gibbs, and John Avila replaced Kerry Hatch on bass. Oingo Boingo appeared in a number of soundtracks in the early to mid-1980s, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which features \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\". Their song charting highest on Billboard Hot 100, \\"Weird Science\\", was written for the John Hughes film of the same name, and was later included on their 1985 album Dead Man's Party. Later, the band made an appearance playing their hit \\"Dead Man's Party\\" on stage in the film Back to School. In addition, they appeared in and performed several songs in the quirky 1984 Tom Hanks movie Bachelor Party, including \\"Who Do You Want to Be?\\", \\"Bachelor Party\\" and \\"Something Isn't Right\\". Then, starting with 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Danny Elfman began scoring major films with increasing frequency, including almost all of Tim Burton's films. Oingo Boingo's 1987 album BOI-NGO was released as a follow-up to the popular Dead Man's Party, but its chart performance was considered an underperformance. After this album, Bacich was replaced by new keyboardist Carl Graves. The band's 1988 release Boingo Alive was actually recorded live on a soundstage, with no studio audience; it consisted of a selection of songs from earlier albums, plus two new compositions. The Boingo Alive track \\"Winning Side\\" became a No. 14 hit on US Modern Rock radio stations. In 1990 the band released their seventh studio album, titled Dark at the End of the Tunnel.

To help women, Mr. Mukherjee said the budget includes measures like the reduction of tax on sanitary napkins. In the budget announced on Monday, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said there will be additional taxes on restaurants, air travel and hotel. On the other hand, he provided some tax breaks for individuals, but those add up to less than 10,000 rupees (220) for a year. Here is a look at the main budget features that would affect individuals in the fiscal year starting April 1. Income Tax: Finance minister has raised the income tax exemption for individual taxpayers by 20,000 rupees (445) to 180,000 rupees (4,000). Individuals don't have to pay taxes on taxable income up to this amount. For women, the exemption stands at 190,000 rupees (4,220). This increase will result in a tax saving of around 2,000 rupees (45) in a year. That's a \\"very small sum, especially when you consider rising prices,\\" says Homi Mistry, partner at consulting firm Deloitte Haskins & Sells. Another tax \\"break\\" will be on infrastructure bond investments. An investment of up to 20,000 rupees in bonds issued by certain infrastructure financing companies will be exempt from tax. That translates to a saving of around 6,200 (135) rupees for an individual in the highest tax bracket. Older taxpayers have the most to cheer about. For tax calculation, individuals of 60 years of age or older will now be considered \\"senior citizens\\" down from the current 65 years. Senior citizens will not have to pay taxes on income of up to 250,000 rupees (5,555). Mr. Mukherjee also created a new class of \\"very senior citizens\\", who are 80 years or older, and who will be exempt from taxes for taxable income up to 500,000 rupees (11,111). On the face of it, these proposals sound good, but it's not clear if there are many 80-year-olds in India who earn taxable income of 500,000 rupees or more. \\"The question is: how many people will benefit?\\" asks Mr. Mistry. Those who have a salaried income, whose companies are deducting the tax at source, and who meet certain conditions, may not have to file an income tax return. This could be convenient for individuals. \\"What are the conditions, we don't know yet,\\" says Mr. Mistry. On a final note, Mr. Muherjee made it clear that the new Direct Taxes Code will be coming into place from April 1, 2012. So, when you make your tax investments this year, plan ahead for the new regime. What's Costly: There will be new taxes on food, travel and hotel stay. 1. Your restaurant bill will likely go up by 3%. A new service tax will be levied on restaurants with air conditioning and which serve alcohol. This tax will be in addition to the existing value added tax, which is typically 12.5% on food and 20% on alcohol. From what we know so far, the service tax will be applicable even if you did not order liquor as part of your meal, says Srinivas Kotni, managing associate at Delhi-based law firm Coporate Lexport. Mr. Kotni says a majority of city restaurants will be affected by this rule because most are now air-conditioned and serve alcohol. 2. Hotels which charge 1,000 rupees (22) or more per night will charge a brand new 5% service tax on their tariff. 3. Air travelers will have to pay an additional 50 rupees (1.1) in service tax on domestic flights, and 250 rupees (5.5) more on international flights. If you fly business class, the service tax will be higher. 4. All services provided by hospitals and clinics which have central air-conditioning and 25 beds or more (which is basically most major hospitals in urban areas), will now be charged a 5% service tax. Earlier, this tax was imposed only on health check-ups or treatment. All government hospitals are exempted. In the next budget, these service taxes could be increased and new services could be brought under the tax net, says Mr. Kotni. Cars: All potential car buyers can breathe a sigh of relief because, contrary to expectations, Mr. Mukherjee has not increased the excise duty on automobiles. He did that last year, and car companies responded by raising prices on some cars by as much as 25,000 rupees. There are some tax breaks for hybrid or environment-friendly cars. This means those who were planning to buy cars like Mahindra's Reva, and hybrid versions of Honda Civic and Toyata Prius can rejoice. Investors: Individuals will have more opportunities to buy stakes of state-owned companies. The government fell short of its target of raising 400 billion rupees (8.9 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 by divestment. Only six government-run companies made public offerings in this period, raising around 220 billion rupees (4.9 billion). Now the government plans to raise 400 billion rupees in year starting April 1. Potential issues will likely come from Coal India, Steel Authority of India Ltd., and National Aluminium Co. Individual investors can expect a 5% to 10% discount on the price of these stocks. Women: During the budget speech, Mr. Mukherjee pointed out that one of his measures to help women was the reduction in central excise duty on things including sanitary napkins and baby diapers from 10% to 1%. City women don't seem to find it a useful measure. Gauri Kalra, a 24-year-old resident of Delhi says that cheaper sanitary napkins and diapers wont make a difference. A tax break, on the other hand, could have helped \\"in shaping up a better life,\\" she said.

Those are savings for things we need in the future. In a similar way, our country also needs money to run properly. For that, people pay some amount from their earnings to the government. This is called tax. When our government plans how to use this money, it's called 'the budget'. Recently, the person who takes care of the country's money, Mr. Mukherjee, told us about the new budget. He said that people might have to pay a bit more money when they eat out in restaurants, when they travel by plane, or when they stay in hotels. This is because they've put some extra taxes on these things. But, he also said some people might see a small drop in the amount of tax they have to pay each year. This depends on how much money they make. And guess what? Grandmas and grandpas who are 60 years or older will have to pay less tax too! There's even a special category for very old grandpas and grandmas who are 80 or older. They'll have to pay even lesser or no tax at all. Mr. Mukherjee also said that there won't be any extra tax on buying cars this year, and those who buy eco-friendly cars can save some money. The budget also made things like sanitary napkins cheaper for women. But, some women don't think this will make a big difference to them. And you know how we sometimes invest or save money for long-term gains like buying a bicycle or a video game? Similarly, adults can now buy bits of some big companies and hopefully make more money in the long run. So, lots of little changes here and there that will come into effect soon, starting from April 1. Is there anything else you want to know about the budget?

It was probably unlikely that a TV comedy series about a Muslim community leader would pass without comment. And so it was that in the region of 200 complaints were made to the BBC yesterday after it broadcast the first episode of Citizen Khan. It was claimed that the programme ‘takes the mickey out of Islam’, was guilty of ‘stereotypes about Asians’ and was ‘disrespectful to the Koran’.

Despite the uproar, the show's creator, Adil Ray, a British Muslim himself, defended his creation, stating that it was designed to entertain and not to offend. He claimed that the characters, though exaggerated, were based on people he had met and that humor was a way to challenge stereotypes and foster understanding between different communities. As the series continued, it gained both supporters and detractors. Some believed that it shed light on the lives of British Muslims and encouraged dialogue, while others maintained that it was disrespectful and perpetuated harmful stereotypes. The debate surrounding the show became the topic of various talks, newspaper articles, and panels, dividing public opinion even more. Facing the controversy head-on, Adil Ray decided to incorporate a few changes in the upcoming episodes to address the concerns of viewers, without compromising the show's original intent. The tweaks included a more balanced representation of the characters, as well as storylines that focused on universal human experiences, such as family relationships, friendship, and personal growth. As the season progressed, viewers began to see the show through a different lens. The once-offensive jokes became sources of deep introspection. People began to discuss the real-life challenges and experiences of Muslim families living in the UK, beyond the caricatures portrayed on screen. In the final episode, Mr. Khan, the titular character, faced a dilemma that forced him to examine his beliefs and prejudices. His journey of personal growth culminated in a heartfelt speech about the importance of unity and understanding within the community, as well as respect for one another's beliefs and culture. Although Citizen Khan never fully escaped its controversy, it also achieved a significant positive impact. It sparked conversations, challenged preconceptions, and served as an example of how comedy, when used thoughtfully, can break down barriers and bring people together. In the end, Citizen Khan developed a loyal following and generated meaningful discussions that contributed to a more inclusive and understanding society. The show was eventually celebrated for its ability to provoke thought and its fearless approach to tackling sensitive issues, turning what was once viewed as a source of conflict into an instrument for positive change."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The Coca Cola polar bear mascot was introduced to capture the essence of the brand and create a visually appealing, ice-cold, and refreshing image for the consumer base. The inspiration for their introduction came from the \\"Always Coca-Cola\\" advertising campaign, which was launched in the same year. The creator behind the animated Coca Cola polar bears was Ken Stewart, a talented commercial animator. He drew his inspiration from his Labrador Retriever, Morgan, who displayed playful and affectionate characteristics, qualities that Stewart believed would endear the polar bears to the audience. The animation was created using state-of-the-art computer graphics and cutting-edge technology for that time, which added to the uniqueness and appeal of these adorable mascots. The first Coca Cola polar bear commercial was titled \\"Northern Lights\\" and featured a group of polar bears enjoying bottles of Coca Cola while gazing at the enchanting aurora borealis. This advertisement quickly became a global sensation, and the polar bear mascots soon became the beloved symbol of Coca Cola's advertising efforts. The campaign resonated with audiences across the globe and helped the brand connect with consumers on an emotional level. Over the years, the Coca Cola polar bears have evolved and appeared in various advertisements, each highlighting a different aspect of the brand's personality and values. They have been used to demonstrate the importance of friendship, community, sharing, and togetherness during special occasions, such as the holiday season. The iconic Coca Cola polar bears' distinctive appearance and expressive nature continue to attract audiences of all ages, making them one of the most recognizable and cherished advertising mascots in the history of marketing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Following the launch of the first production-ready version of Ethereum this month, bitcoin businesses are moving to investigate how they might apply the blockchain platform as part of their existing products or services. So far, startups as diverse as cloud money platform Uphold, bitcoin mining firm BTCS and hardware device provider Ledger are among those that have announced Ethereum initiatives. And in what may be one of the most high-profile signs of interest, bitcoin startup Coinbase plans to hold an internal event on the platform this week. However, exactly how these companies will seek to use Ethereum, and whether they will do so in a way that is consistent with the vision of the next-generation blockchain platform remains unclear. Announced in 2014, Ethereum is distinguished by its support for smart contracts and ability to support decentralized applications or dapps. Despite these wide uses, interviews suggest bitcoin startups are adding support for Ethereum through services that aim to boost the liquidity of its transaction token, ether, and that while they are excited about its larger potential, they're not sure how to define this opportunity or what it may mean for their business. Uphold EVP Jorge Pereira, for example, said that his firm is seeking to add support for ether as a first step, but that it will remain open to other applications as they emerge. Still, he spoke to overall change in perception that has brought about this shift. Pereira told CoinDesk: \\"Before, Ethereum was a curiosity. No one knew whether it would take off. Now it's achieved a number of goals that make it something that has sizeable potential. The first thing we can easily do is provide support for holding and converting ether, however, with Ethereum we don't see the goal being that.\\" Elsewhere, members of the bitcoin community struck similar tones. Ledger co-founder Thomas France noted his firm sees its support of Ethereum as a necessary step toward applying its technology to a wider variety of blockchains. Ledger recently announced support for Eris Industries, for example, which offers permissioned blockchain solutions. \\"The core of our business is to provide ways to leverage secure hardware for developers and companies,\\" France told CoinDesk. Other industry businesses have sought to offer services for those seeking to buy or sell ethers in a similar manner as digital currencies, even as the platform's creators indicate ether is not meant to be a payment method or store of value. Tapping new markets Of interest for many of those interviewed was finding new lines of business. The statements suggest Ethereum may become a way for some firms to seek to grow their market size at a time when adoption of bitcoin as a digital currency appears to be stalling. BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp, for example, said that the bitcoin wallet and security specialist is discussing whether it would be worth developing a wallet for the blockchain platform, though he cautioned such talks remain in early stages. \\"Our business is helping people secure crypto. It mainly comes down to how much demand there is to secure ether from institutions,\\" he said. Not all those who are interested have a long-term focus in mind, however. Charles Allen, CEO of bitcoin mining outfit BTCS, noted that his firm recently built custom Ethereum mining rigs as part of a pilot program due to the escalating price of ether. In recent weeks, ether has been one of the more volatile currencies, rising to highs of around 13, up about 10 from six months ago. Allen indicated that BTCS is well-positioned to roll out hardware for Ethereum mining, given its background in creating specialized hardware for bitcoin mining. \\"You can't ignore [Ethereum] right now, at this price level, with a 1bn market cap,\\" Allen said in a recent interview. He went on to indicate that the pilot seeks to examine whether mining Ethereum would be profitable given that it plans to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mining, meaning eventually, its transaction verification process would transition to the point where it would not require hardware. Still, he said that since Ethereum runs on graphics processing units (GPUs), it's possible for the company to resell the hardware it purchases. \\"For us, this is opportunistic. You can't mine Ethereum forever, [but] if we can jump in and make some money it makes a lot of sense,\\" he said. 'Unfortunate' attempts In interview, representatives of the Ethereum project reported mixed feelings about the recent trend. The platform's inventor, Vitalik Buterin, noted he has been disappointed by how bitcoin industry firms are seeking to leverage the technology, noting that, to date, most initiatives have failed to \\"capture what the platform is about\\". He told CoinDesk: \\"Some of that is fairly simple, there's [we accept] bitcoin, we're just going to accept ether, which is nice, but it's kind of unfortunate. The whole thing is to do all the blockchain stuff other than currency.\\" Buterin suggested that many industry firms haven't digested the platform's value propositions, which he acknowledged may be more abstract than bitcoin's, and to an extent, a threat to some industry business models. \\"A more traditional company might ask can we accept ether. But, that's not the point. The point is that you will be replaced by a smart contract that is fully autonomous and doesn't charge fees,\\" he remarked. Still, there are problems in the Ethereum ecosystem that Buterin indicated he hopes innovators in the bitcoin space and beyond will solve. For instance, he pointed to the centralization of Ethereum's mining pools and the relative newness of its wallet applications as areas where it could benefit from the knowledge of other open-source technology communities. Wait and see Interviews suggest that these opportunities are resonating with industry businesses, even those that may have just taken initial steps to embrace ether. For example, Andrew Lee, CEO of bitcoin deals platform Purse, noted that his startup is accepting ether, but that it has explored how Ethereum could be used to automate certain parts of the online commerce process and as part of conversations about the future of supply chains. Lee suggested it remains to be seen whether applications like smart contracts become a use case for Ethereum, or if other efforts are successful at replicating this functionality on the bitcoin blockchain, an idea industry startup RSK Labs has raised 1m to undertake. \\"I think what I foresee is there will be a limit to what bitcoin can do, and if we get there, Ethereum would be a good alternative,\\" Lee said. Others noted that this exploration process is likely to take time, and that the ecosystem can be expected to continue to look for ways to apply Ethereum as the project matures. Pereira added: \\"With Ethereum, we're still figuring it out as a community.\\" Stolen idea image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There’s a new digital currency that’s looking to give bitcoin a run for its money: Ethereum. In a sense, it’s an offspring of bitcoin that’s capitalizing on and enriching blockchain technology. Developers and cryptomaniacs around the world are rejoicing about its potential applications. But you can so rejoice, too. And that’s because it’s not exactly a digital currency. It takes the conceptual basis for bitcoin and makes it applicable to just about anything. Before we get into the deep water, though, you’ll probably need… A Wee Bit of Background Ethereum has been in the works since late 2013, when Vitalik Buterin — who’s now just 22 years old — released this Ethereum white paper. About a year later, after fellow hackers joined the venture, Ethereum launched a public crowdsale. In 42 days, Ethereum collected almost 32,000 bitcoin — equivalent to about 18.5 million USD. Ethereum supports applications that run on its custom-built blockchain. A blockchain, for those who don’t know, is — in effect — an indestructible, public, immutable ledger. An unmodifiable record of what’s happened. Blockchains are attractive because they decentralize. Instead of one person or institution running the system — i.e. a bank, or Apple, or Facebook — the blockchain involves and empowers all users in both its creation and supervision. By distributing the computational burden, you’re decentralizing. “Ethereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed.” — Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum creator Blockchains have thus far proven transparent and secure, and blockchain-based currencies — like bitcoin — allow for virtual, virtually immediate, cryptographically secure transactions. Users don’t even need traditional bank accounts to transact. Applications that run on Ethereum’s decentralized, blockchain-based platform enjoy more than just those benefits, though. A blockchain precludes downtime, censorship, and third-party interference. Ethereum wants its platform to decentralize and therefore improve the trustworthiness of all possible transactions — social networks, medical information, and even, one day, governance. Anything that can be computed can become a decentralized Ethereum application. The creators have unveiled the monolith. It’s up to developers to figure out how best to put it to work. George Hallam, Ethereum’s external relations director, tells Inverse that “Ethereum is essentially a programmable blockchain that puts the user in control. Rather than lock users to a set of pre-defined applications within the protocol, Ethereum allows them to create their own applications in the form of Smart Contracts (DApps), which can be as complex as required. This significantly increases the versatility and capability of the Ethereum blockchain as a whole.” Ethereum's cofounders: Vitalik Buterin, right, and Gavin Wood, left. Why You Should Care About the Ethereum Blockchain Ethereum cuts out the middlemen involved in all transactions, whether that transaction relies on money or not. In an idealistically Ethereum-powered world, there’d be no central bank taking percentages off each card swipe, there’d be no individual person deciding what’s content and what’s not, there’d be no Uber cutting rates on its drivers. There’d be very little bureaucracy. Since Ethereum is powered by thousands upon thousands of nodes (crudely, a node is a computer connected to the Ethereum network), it won’t ever crash, can’t be censored, and isn’t open to fraud or interference. But can you trust Ethereum? you might ask, dubious. In a sense, “trust” doesn’t even apply: since the network — the blockchain — is maintained and surveilled by all users by virtue of their participation, there’s no individual person or organization in whom or in which you must place your trust. And, likewise, there’s no individual person or organization whose sabotage can spell catastrophe. Don’t (Just) Call it a Cryptocurrency Ethereum’s creators themselves don’t refer to it as a “cryptocurrency.” Ethereum is a shared computing platform, and its base unit is ether, the “cryptofuel” that powers the network: “a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.” So ether pays for computation. This computation takes place within the Ethereum Virtual Machine; the EVM makes it possible for smart contracts to run on Ethereum’s blockchain. Were these computations free, Hallam says, “Ethereum solves the Halting Problem, where users could potentially write infinite loops into their smart contracts, thus using up all of the platforms available resources (similar to a traditional DDoS attack on a website). By putting a price on computation, infinite loops would require an infinite amount of Ether, making such an attack impossible.” But these tokens — ether — are still both exchangeable and valuable, so are, in a sense, a currency. You can own ether, you can spend ether. (“Ether” is both singular and plural.) Ether can be “mined,” like bitcoin, using a network of powerful computers. 1 ETH, at time of writing, is worth around 12 USD. You can watch the “etherchain” update live, here, to get a better conceptual sense of how it works and how often “miners” strike “ether.” How Ethereum Is Already Changing the Game Safe to say that old-hat institutions that are accustomed to and continue to benefit from centralization will not go down without a fight? Not quite. Unlikely corporations are sneaking aboard the bandwagon. Original The Creator of Litecoin Is A Meme King This week in New York City, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is hosting the 2016 Blockchain Symposium. There, attendees will hear from top dogs at IBM, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. IBM and Samsung have already teamed up to put Ethereum into practice. Together, they made a washing machine that can reorder detergent when the supply is low, call a repairman when it malfunctions, and even do laundry when the electricity is cheapest. R3, a financial consortium, is also running several experiments with Ethereum. More and more companies may start to see the benefit of Ethereum. By eliminating the need for a middleman, costs and fees drop. Uber collects a significant percentage of every transaction, for instance — and often to the detriment of the driver. With Ethereum, these collections could be eliminated via smart contracts,” or “decentralized apps.” These so-called DApps are already impressive in number. We’ll keep up with these decentralized apps as they get more and more exciting in the days and months to come. ||||| Please agree to this before downloading SECURITY WARNINGS You are responsible for your own computer security.

LEGAL WARNING SHORT VERSION Disclaimer of Liabilities and Warranties The user expressly knows and agrees that the user is using the Ethereum platform at the user’s sole risk. The user acknowledges that the user has an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based open source software, eth platform and ethereum The user acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the disclaimers of liability contained herein apply to any and all damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to risks of, use of, or inability to use, ethereum or the Ethereum platform under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence) and that neither Stiftung Ethereum (i.e. Ethereum Foundation) nor Ethereum team shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data that occurs as a result. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Therefore, some of the above limitations in this section may not apply to a user. In particular, nothing in these terms shall affect the statutory rights of any user or exclude injury arising from any willful misconduct or fraud of Stiftung Ethereum. LONG VERSION The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the Ethereum open source software platform (“Ethereum Platform”). Prior to any use of the Ethereum Platform, the User confirms to understand and expressly agrees to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with, Stiftung Ethereum (“Stiftung Ethereum”) is termed the “Ethereum Team.” The Platform will be developed by persons and entities who support Ethereum, including both volunteers and developers who are paid by nonprofit entities interested in supporting the Ethereum Platform. The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use the Ethereum Platform and ETH and expressly agrees to neither hold Ethereum Stiftung nor the Ethereum Team liable should any of the following risks occur: Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions The Ethereum Platform and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Stiftung Ethereum to continue to develop the Ethereum Platform, or which could impede or limit the ability of a User to use Ethereum Platform or ETH. Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Ethereum Networks It is possible that alternative Ethereum-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform. The Ethereum network may compete with these alternative Ethereum-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Ethereum Platform or Distributed Applications It is possible that the Ethereum Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Ethereum Platform and potential uses of ETH. It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties. Risk that the Ethereum Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of User The User recognizes that the Ethereum Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Ethereum Platform held by the User may not be met upon release of the Ethereum Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Ethereum Platform. Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Ethereum Platform Core Infrastructure Software The Ethereum Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Ethereum Stiftung or the Ethereum Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Stiftung Ethereum, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Ethereum Platform causing the system to lose ETH stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Ethereum Platform. Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, Stiftung Ethereum intends to update the protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner. Risk of Ether Mining Attacks As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Ethereum Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: Double-spend attacks Majority mining power attacks, “Selfish-mining” attacks Race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum Stiftung and Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful. Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for ETH could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can create new ETH tokens. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Instability in the demand of for ETH may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an Ethereum based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation. Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the Ethereum Platform If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy. Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING THE Ethereum PLATFORM AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGES AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, ETH PLATFORM AND ETH. THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ETH OR THE Ethereum PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER Stiftung Ethereum NOR ETHEREUM TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO A USER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY USER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF Stiftung Ethereum. Risk of temporary network incoherence We recommend any groups handling large or important transactions to maintain a voluntary 24 hour waiting period on any ether deposited. In case the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues in the clients, we will endeavor to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within the voluntary 24 hour waiting period. Dispute Resolution All disputes or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or use of the Ethereum Platform shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be Swiss resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice -- in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court’s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant’s nomination. All nominations must be Swiss resident. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain “independent” of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be Zug, Switzerland. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of Switzerland and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositeur or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If your relationship with your former partner involved physical or emotional abuse, attempting to negotiate pet custody with them directly may not be the best option for you. Breakups are seldom completely amicable, but unless there are abuse problems, you should be able to get your former partner to listen to reason. However, if your former partner was abusive, or if you suspect they might hurt your pet, call an animal law attorney immediately to learn your options. You can find an attorney by doing a general internet search for \\"animal law attorney\\" with the name of your city or state. You also may be able to find names through your state or local bar association's online directory. In some cases, animal law attorneys have been successful with getting restraining orders that include pets. If you're concerned for the safety of your pet as well as yourself, talk to a family law attorney who has experience with restraining orders. You also can seek help from a local domestic violence shelter. Ideally, you want to talk about pet custody in a private environment where the two of you can talk about the issues involved with a minimum of distractions. You may want to choose a neutral location such as a local café or restaurant. Go for a time when you are both available, but try not to make it late at night or on a weekend when the place will be packed. Let them know what you want to talk about when you schedule the meeting. If they try to insult or demean you for making such a big deal over it, simply tell them that it means a lot to you and you'd appreciate it if they would give you the benefit of the doubt and take you seriously. When you call to schedule the meeting, try to keep your conversation civil. You want to meet and discuss the issue, but there's no need to get in a fight about it over the phone. According to state law, pets are considered property. This means that with pet custody, as with determining ownership of other items of personal property, the law favors the person in possession. You may have heard the phrase \\"possession is nine-tenths of the law.\\" This phrase is true in most cases and applies to the issue of pet custody. If your former partner already has taken your pet with them, coming to an agreement together may be the best chance you have of getting your pet back. If you end up having to take them to court and they already have possession of the animal, chances are the court will end up awarding custody to them. There are a lot of issues wrapped up in pet care, including food, activities, and veterinary care. Assuming that both of you love the pet and want what's best for the animal, you want to go over all of these aspects at your meeting with your former spouse. Create an outline of your history with your pet, starting from the beginning. This can help you create arguments for why you should get pet custody after the breakup. For example, suppose you are the one who initially adopted the pet. Your former partner was reluctant at first and wanted nothing to do with it, but eventually came around and grew to love the animal. In that case, the fact that you originally adopted the animal works in your favor. It also helps if you are typically the one to take your pet to the vet or the groomer and buy its food. Money can be difficult if you and your former partner had a joint bank account. In that case, think about who provided most of the care and attention. You also may want to think about which of you the animal is more attached to – although typically that will be the person who most often feeds and cares for the pet. It can be difficult to hold back your emotions if you're particularly attached to your pet, but try to do your best to look at the situation objectively and determine which of you is best suited to take care of the animal. Regardless of your feelings, if your former partner would take better care of your pet than you would be able to, you may want to let them have custody. Just make sure it's understood that you want to be able to come and visit your pet – for example, to visit once a week and take the dog for a walk in the park. On the other hand, if you have the time and money to adequately support your pet, use the reasons you wrote in your outline to explain to your former partner why you want custody of your pet. Breakups rarely happen for no reason. Tensions are bound to be high anyway, but the last thing you want to do is turn your pet custody meeting into a shouting match. Try to keep in mind that you are there because you both love and care for your pet. If your former partner didn't care about the animal, they probably would have let you have it with no problem. If you find yourself getting angry or frustrated, turn your attention back to your pet. Keep your pet's face in your mind and remember what you're doing this for. It also can help to remind your former partner, if things start to get heated, that you're both there for your pet, not for each other. Assume that your former partner genuinely cares about your pet and its well-being. They may have serious concerns about your ability to provide adequate care for the animal. You can only learn these concerns by keeping an open mind and listening carefully. Try to ask your former partner questions, if necessary, to draw out their reasons for not wanting to give you custody of your pet. By listening to your former partner's concerns, you may be able to find a solution that makes both of you happy and puts your pet in as good a position as it was before the breakup. For example, suppose your former partner is concerned you won't have time to take the dog for a walk during the day because you have a 30-minute commute to work and are gone all day. In that situation, you may be able to work out an arrangement in which you allow your former partner to come over during the day to walk the dog. In exchange, you could pay them a small amount (which could potentially save you from having to hire a stranger to walk your dog). . When you sit down and discuss the situation rationally, hopefully you and your former partner are able to come to an agreement regarding custody of your pet. If you do, draw up a written agreement that both of you can sign. A signed written agreement is legally binding, but it's not necessary to stress that point. Nor do you need to hire a lawyer or draft a complex contract with lots of legalese. A simple agreement that outlines what you've decided is fine. Include everything you've discussed about your pet's care. Both of you should sign it, then make sure your former partner gets a copy of the signed agreement. To avoid any problems later, grab someone to witness the signatures, or take a photo on your phone of each of you signing the agreement.

Michael Craig Judge (born October 17, 1962) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director and musician. Judge is the creator of the television series Beavis and Butt-Head (1993-97, 2011), and co-creator of the television series King of the Hill (1997-2010), The Goode Family (2009), Silicon Valley (2014-present), and Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus (2017). He also wrote and directed the films Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1996), Office Space (1999), Idiocracy (2006) and Extract (2009). Raised in New Mexico, Judge graduated from University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics. Despite his King of the Hill protagonist Hank Hill being identifiable as a conservative and his The Goode Family being essentially a satire of many liberal precepts, Judge avoids discussing his political leanings. The Goode Family has been described as a conservative show. In reviewing Idiocracy, Salon stated, \\"Judge's gimlet eye is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on South Park libertarianism.\\" A writer for the libertarian magazine Reason seems to agree, comparing King of the Hill to the anti-authoritarian point of view of South Park and The Simpsons, though he calls the show more populist, noting the disdain King of the Hill seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and big-box chains. Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in an IGN interview about King of the Hill: I try to not let the show get too political. To me, it's more social than political I guess you'd say, because that's funnier. I don't really like political reference humor that much. Although I liked the episode \\"Hank's Bully\\" where Hank's talking to the mailman and he says, 'Why would anyone want to lick a stamp that has Bill Clinton on it?' To me that's just like more of a character thing about Hank than it is a political joke or anything. I don't want to do a bunch of stuff about the war, particularly. In June 2016, before the presidential election in November, Rolling Stone published an article stating that Judge would produce Idiocracy themed campaign advertisements opposing Donald Trump's presidential campaign if given permission from Fox to do so. It was later reported by Business Insider that the ads would not go forward. did he have a strong stance on one particular political view?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it seems that Mike Judge does not have a strong stance on one particular political view.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?\\" The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: \\"If I could just come down, I would show you!\\" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully.

How to choose an accent wall Find the natural focal point in the room. The focal point of a room is not always the wall you see when you first walk in. Go with the wall that you want to draw attention to because it's interesting or unique in some way.","completion":"Choosing an accent wall can greatly enhance the aesthetic appeal of a room while also creating a sense of depth and dimension. It’s important, however, to pick the right wall to accent, considering various factors such as the focal point of the room, the overall color scheme, and the desired visual effect. Let’s go through a detailed step-by-step guide on how to choose an accent wall: 1. Identify the room's focal point: The focal point is the first thing that captures one's attention when entering a room. It could be a large window, a fireplace, a piece of art, or even an architectural feature like a built-in bookshelf. Choosing the wall surrounding or in closest proximity to the focal point ensures that your accent wall will seamlessly integrate into the room’s design and enhance its overall appeal. 2. Consider the room's layout: Assess the shape and dimensions of the room to help determine which wall would make the best accent wall. Typically, the ideal accent wall is one with minimal to no interruptions such as doors, windows, or switches. However, exceptions can be made if the wall has unique features that add visual interest. 3. Take note of the available lighting: The accent wall should be illuminated beautifully, whether it's through natural light or artificial sources. Consider walls that receive an ample amount of sunlight, which will help in highlighting the accents during the day. Additionally, well-placed floor lamps, table lamps, or wall sconces can accentuate the accented wall when the room’s primary source of light is unavailable. 4. Assess your color scheme: The accent wall should complement the room's color palette, not clash with it. When selecting the color or pattern for your accent wall, keep in mind the other colors in the room. The accent wall should be visually striking and create a sense of balance within the space. 5. Consider different techniques and materials: You're not limited to just paint when creating an accent wall. Wallpaper, wood, stone, and fabric are just a few examples of materials that can be incorporated to create a unique and immersive design. Also, feel free to explore different painting techniques such as color blocking, geometric patterns, or even a large-scale mural. 6. Keep the room's purpose in mind: The room's primary function should play a role in your accent wall choice. For example, a bedroom might benefit from a calming and soothing accent wall, while a home office could feature a bolder and more energizing design. 7. Test your choice before committing: Before you purchase paint or materials, try out different ideas by using paint samples, swatches, or digital tools that allow you to visualize your choices. Experiment with different colors, patterns, and materials to see which option works best for the space. 8. Seek advice and inspiration: If you're uncertain about your choice, consult with friends, family, or interior design professionals for advice. You can also seek inspiration from design websites, blogs, and magazines to see how various accent wall options have been implemented in similar spaces. 9. Reevaluate and tweak if necessary: Once you've made your decision and installed the accent wall, step back and assess the overall result. Does the accent wall enhance the room as you had envisioned? If not, make adjustments or consider alternative options to perfect the look and feel of the space. By following these steps, you’ll be able to choose an accent wall that not only highlights the room's focal point but also enhances the space's overall aesthetic appeal, creating a visually striking and harmonious environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. and a hint : Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Please answer this question : In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?","completion":"To determine in which year Rob would not observe the quarrying effect, we need to consider the presence of valley glaciers, as quarrying occurs in this type of glacier. Last year, Rob visited the Alps mountains in Austria, where he saw a unique type of glacier called a valley glacier. This means that the quarrying effect could be observed there. This year, he visited the Ural mountains in Russia, where he didn't see any valley glaciers. As the quarrying effect occurs in valley glaciers, it can be concluded that Rob would not observe the quarrying effect in the Ural mountains.

Context: My mom has been married three times, (nothing against her) and the first two times ended up a total mess. My dad, the first one, ended up just being a shot gun wedding. He was abusive and too young to be married with a child. They got divorced shortly after. A couple years later she met a man named Rob. He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas. They were married for 5 years and she was just as miserable those 5 years. He was mean, he lied about everything, he was addicted to porn and stole from his job. He was controlling and wouldn’t let anyone else handle money. It was a rough house to grow up in and hard on my mom as she tried to keep me from the abuse. Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her “Everyone puts on an act at first.” As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was. After they got divorced he had on and off again relationships, got a girl pregnant and got married, then she divorced him. He lived with his cousin for a while. The only stability he ever had was with my mom and I. I think that’s why he wanted to leave. Stability meant he had to become an adult and he didn’t want to have to take responsibility.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following. * pull it off. * chop it off.","completion":"Pulling it off could lead to complications such as accidental splattering of jalapeño juice that contains capsaicin, which can be irritating. Therefore, the most sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning is chopping it off. Using a knife or a sharp instrument provides control over the process, unlike pulling, which could apply an unpredictable amount of force. In detail, here are the steps to safely chop off the tail of a jalapeño pepper: 1. Choose the Right Jalapeño: The first step is choosing the right jalapeño. Look for a firm one with a bright green color and no signs of shriveling or soft spots. 2. Prepare Your Work Area: Ensure your work area is clean and you have a cutting board and sharp knife available. Consider wearing disposable gloves to avoid getting capsaicin (a compound in jalapeños that causes the spicy sensation) on your hands, which can lead to discomfort or a burning sensation. 3. Wash the Jalapeño: Before chopping off the tail of the jalapeño, wash it thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt or pesticides. Dry it completely so it doesn't slip on the cutting board. 4. Hold the Pepper: Grasp the jalapeño pepper firmly by the tail (also known as the stem or the cap), ensuring your fingers are away from the area where you intend to cut. 5. Make the Cut: Place the blade of your knife across the top of the jalapeño, positioning it just beneath the tail. Carefully apply downward pressure to chop off the tail in one swift action. The tail will separate from the rest of the jalapeño. 6. Dispose of the Tail: You can now throw away the removed tail. Be sure to wash your hands again, and clean the knife and cutting board to remove any capsaicin residue. 7. Continue Prepping: After removing the tail, you can proceed with slicing, deseeding, or stuffing the jalapeño as per your recipe. Remember that safety is paramount in the kitchen; therefore, using a knife is the preferred method for cleanly and predictably cutting off the tail, as opposed to pulling it off. It is important to note as well that you must be careful if cutting a portion of the pepper that contains the seeds and veins, where most of the spiciness is concentrated. Plus, if you don't have plenty of experience dealing with spicy peppers, it's highly recommended to use gloves to prevent skin irritation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Strong Academic Performance: Stanford seeks students who have demonstrated excellence in their studies. A high GPA, challenging coursework (AP, IB, or honors courses), and a strong class rank will demonstrate your academic aptitude. 2. Outstanding Test Scores: High standardized test scores, such as the SAT or ACT, are essential for applicants. Having scores in the top percentile will strengthen your application. 3. Extracurricular Activities: Involvement in extracurricular activities, particularly those demonstrating leadership, teamwork, or dedication to a specific area, is an important aspect of your application.

These letters should speak to your character, commitment, and achievements, providing firsthand evidence of your abilities and potential. 6. Personal Essays: Stanford requires applicants to write multiple essays as part of their application. These essays are an opportunity to express your unique personality, experiences, and aspirations. They help the admissions committee get to know you beyond numbers and achievements. Writing thoughtful, authentic, and well-crafted essays is crucial. 7.

The Living End were formed in 1994 by Chris Cheney and Scott Owen, who had met years earlier in primary school through their older sisters and began performing together from 1990 while attending Wheelers Hill Secondary College in Melbourne. Cheney and Owen had their first public gig at The Rob Roy in Melbourne in 1991. Cheney was a fan of rockabilly group Stray Cats and this prompted Owen, who originally played piano, to switch to double bass. The pair formed a cover band, The Runaway Boys, which performed Stray Cats and The Clash material. That group were named after a track, of the same name, from the Stray Cats self-titled debut album (February 1981). The Runaway Boys initially played in the local rockabilly music scene but expanded their audience by performing in regional towns. Cheney later recalled \\"[w]e played to all the jivers and rock 'n' rollers ... And we slowly drifted into Melbourne's rockabilly scene\\". As Cheney and Owen persevered, the band went through several drummers, while they were still attending school. By 1994 Cheney and Owen were writing their own material and decided to change the band's name to The Living End - a reference to the film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney \\"It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... We were still into the whole '50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music\\". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance. During that year they recorded a track, \\"Headlines\\", which had been co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent a T-shirt and demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for the 1995 Australian tour by his band, Green Day. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, Hellbound, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included \\"Headlines\\" from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP's sound: \\"they turned their back on '50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk\\". In November 1995, the trio recorded their second EP, It's for Your Own Good, which appeared in the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, \\"From Here on In\\", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. \\"From Here on In\\" was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language. The Living End toured Australia for a year, then in August 1997 they recorded new material to sell at their live shows. Their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", was issued in January the following year. Also that month they had supported The Offspring on the Australian leg of their tour. \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified double-platinum by ARIA for shipment of 140,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 it won the Highest Selling Single category; and eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the 1990s. It lasted a record-breaking 47 weeks in the Top 50. In October 1998 it peaked at No. 28 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was later featured in the game, Guitar Hero World Tour. \\"Second Solution\\" was used in the soundtrack for the 2002 movie, Cheats, which starred Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, and Mary Tyler Moore. Early in 1998 \\"Prisoner of Society\\" was issued as a separate single in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the US. The single appeared in the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. The band signed with Modular Recordings for the release of their debut self-titled album, which appeared on 12 October 1998, and was co-produced by Gravina with the trio. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, became the then-second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history and, by 1999, was certified 4x Platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. Their next Australian single, \\"Save the Day\\", was issued in September 1998, a month ahead of the album. It made the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became their highest charting hit on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it reached No. 10. From the album, a total of six singles were released including a live cover version of \\"Tainted Love\\", which was issued as a radio-only single on Triple J. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, The Living End won two more awards: Best Group and Breakthrough Artist - Album. At the ceremony they were also nominated for Album of the Year and Highest Selling Album. In October 2010 their debut album was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. The Living End's second album, Roll On, was recorded during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 40 in New Zealand. Although Roll On was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had \\"broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics\\". The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be as strong as the self-titled album; \\"[it's] an absolute scorcher! That's what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot\\". Cheney later stated that he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, \\"Prisoner of Society\\", and the album showed this by displaying other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone' Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they \\"stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll - and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after [T]he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party\\". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity. The album's first two singles, \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" and the title track, peaked into the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" also reached the top 20 in New Zealand, while \\"Roll On\\" peaked at No. 33 on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart, and appeared in the top 150 of the UK Singles Chart. In March 2001 Billboard's review of Roll On described their sound as \\"Aussie punkabilly\\", while the group's lyrics show a \\"socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict\\". The trio received US-wide coverage by playing on both Conan O'Brien's and David Letterman's late-night variety shows. The album included \\"Carry me Home\\", which appeared on the Guitar Hero II soundtrack. However, touring in support of Roll On and the related singles was halted after Cheney had a car accident on the Great Ocean Road, rendering him unable to play for a significant period of time: he was \\"hospitalised for 2 months\\". He had been on travelling to the house of a member of fellow Australian band and tour mates, Bodyjar.

Authorities said the official cause of death for the parents, Benjamin and Kristi Strack, is suicide, homicide for the two youngest children and it could not be determined for the 14-year-old son. Police said the autopsies drug toxicity caused all five deaths. According to police, officials found a letter written by the 14-year-old son, Benson. The letter stated he knew he was going to die and left his possessions to a friend. Officials said friends and family told them Benjamin and Kristi had said they were concerned with the \\"evil in world,\\" a \\"pending apocalypse\\" and wanted to escape the \\"impending doom.\\" Friends said they thought thought that might mean the family could be moving somewhere to live \\"off the grid.\\" Benjamin and Kristi Strack, along with three of their children, were found dead on Sept. 27, 2014 inside their home. They were discovered by the couple’s 18-year-old son, who is now the only surviving member of the immediate family. Police said they found medications and cups filled with a “red liquid” next to the bodies of five members of a Springville family. According to documents, “Investigators at the scene determined the cause of death to be an accidental or intentional poisoning either by ingestion or environmental causes.\\" In another warrant affidavit, officers said they found the bodies of Benjamin and Kristi Strack and their children Benson, 14; Emery, 12; and Zion, 11; inside the master bedroom. “Kristi and Benjamin were lying in the bed and the three children were lying around the bed, covered in bedding up to their necks,” police wrote in an affidavit. “Officers reported there was a red liquid substance coming from the mouth of Kristi Strack. All the occupants of the home were non-responsive. Next to each of the victims was a cup/drink with a liquid inside.” Police wrote in a search warrant affidavit that they recovered boxes of cold and flu medication. “Also in the same closed bag, were two empty boxes of allergy relief medication consistent with generic Benadryl. Approximately five empty blister packs were located for this medication. Among the items located were cups with a red liquid substance in Pepsi cups. Also located withing the residence were empty bottles of liquid Methadone. The Methadone was dispensed to from a drug treatment clinic. Some of the empty bottles had future dates on them,” the search warrant affidavit stated. An officer stated in another affidavit that it is probable the deaths were not accidental, writing: “…with the placement of the bodies, it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased.” MORE: Family found dead in bedroom of Springville home ||||| SPRINGVILLE, Utah (AP) — A Utah couple and their three children who were found dead in their home last fall overdosed on drugs after the parents told friends and family they were worried about the apocalypse, authorities said Tuesday.

(Associated Press) Police also found old letters written by the mother to a Utah inmate serving time for killing family members in the name of God, slayings chronicled in the 2003 Jon Krakauer book \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\" Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their four children — ages 11, 12 and 14 — were found dead in September in a locked bedroom of their Springville home. All five were tucked into covers in and around their parents' bed. At a news conference Tuesday, Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said investigators have concluded their probe and determined the family members died from drug toxicity from either methadone, heroin or a combination of drugs, including those found in cold medicine. Authorities determined the parents committed suicide. The younger two children's deaths were ruled homicides, although Finlayson said there were no signs of a struggle. The manner of death for the 14-year-old, Benson Strack, was undetermined. Police said Benson wrote a goodbye letter, leaving some of his belongings to his best friend. The only other recent writing the family left behind was a notebook containing handwritten to-do lists about feeding the pets and other chores. Finlayson said interviews with people who knew the Stracks indicated the parents were worried about evil in the world and wanted to escape from \\"impending doom.\\" \\"There seemed to be a concern about a pending apocalypse that the parents bought into,\\" Finlayson said. \\"While some friends though that suicide may have been, or could have been, included in their plans, others believed they were going to move somewhere and live off the grid.\\" During their investigation, police found years-old letters between Kristi Strack and Dan Lafferty, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted of committing a double-murder with his brother Ron. \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" is about members of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told through the true story of the Laffertys' crimes. The two killed their brother's wife and 15-month old daughter. Ron Lafferty is on death row after his conviction in the July 1984 slayings of his sister-in-law, Brenda Lafferty, and her baby in American Fork. He claimed to have had a religious revelation sanctioning the slayings because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy. Investigators said Kristi Strack was deeply interested in the case and struck up a friendship with Dan Lafferty. \\"It was almost like he talked to her like one of his children,\\" Lt. David Caron said. She and her husband both became close to him, and he had directed his remains to go to them after his death. They hadn't talked to him since 2008 and investigators do not believe the couple's beliefs came from Dan Lafferty, police Cpl. Greg Turnbow said. \\"He felt really sad they had committed suicide,\\" Caron said. Benjamin Strack's brother Jacob said the final report from investigators wasn't surprising to relatives still mourning the family's deaths. Looking back, the connection to Dan Lafferty was a troubling sign about the couple's mental state, he said. The Stracks' older son and the children's grandmother found the bodies Sept. 27, according to search warrants. The older son was Kristi Strack's child from a previous marriage. Police found cups with liquid inside next to each of the bodies and a child's sand bucket behind a door with traces of the same combination of methadone and cold medication that was found in their systems. Police believe that Benjamin Strack died last because he was the only member of the family who wasn't underneath bed covers. In a recording of the 911 call released Tuesday, family friend Maureen Ledbetter tells the dispatcher about the deaths as grandmother Valerie Sudweeks screams in the background. The methadone used in the deaths was prescribed to Kristi Strack, police said. Court records show Benjamin and Kristi Strack had a history of legal and financial problems and had gone through court-ordered drug treatment several years ago. Investigators said they weren't aware of any contact with state child services workers. Benjamin Strack's boss, bricklaying company owner Alex Short, has said it appeared those troubles were behind them. Springville is a city of about 30,000 near Provo, about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. ||||| SPRINGVILLE — Apparently concerned with the \\"evil in the world\\" and a pending apocalypse, Benjamin and Kristi Strack took the lives of three of their children and then killed themselves with lethal doses of drugs, Springville police believe. The children — Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11 — all died of a lethal cocktail of diphenhydramine and methadone. Kristi Strack died of a combination of those drugs plus dextrophan and doxylamine. Benjamin Strack died from toxic levels of heroin, according to a report from the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office. Ben and Krisiti Strack's deaths were determined to be suicides. The manners of death for Emery and Zion were labeled as homicides because police said they were too young to consent to any type of suicide pact. The death of 14-year-old Benson, who wrote what was thought to be a goodbye letter to a friend prior to his death, was listed as \\"undetermined.\\" \\"There are some questions we can't answer and may never be able to answer,\\" Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said Tuesday. Investigators believe the children all drank from a small bucket, like a pail that a child would bring to a beach, that contained the lethal cocktail that first put them asleep before killing them. \\"There is no evidence any of the family members were forced to take lethal doses of any drug combinations, nor was there any evidence they took the drugs willingly,\\" Finlayson said, adding there were no signs of a struggle either. A red liquid that had been found in cups in the bedroom turned out to have no controlled substances in them, he said. Whether the youngest children knew what they were drinking is a question that police don't believe they will ever be able to answer. With the exception of Benson's goodbye letter, no suicide notes were found. The release of the final report into the Strack family deaths brings to a conclusion the Springville Police Department's investigation into the tragic incident from the night of Sept. 27, 2014, when all five bodies were found in the parents' bedroom, 954 E. 900 South, by the Stracks' oldest son. Because the oldest son was an adult, had a job and was engaged, Finlayson said, investigators can only speculate that that was the reason he was not included in the Stracks' plan. The crime scene How to get help for mental illness or suicide prevention: by Devon Dolan SALT LAKE CITY — After the Springville Police Department released its findings in the murder-suicides of the Strack family Tuesday, licensed therapist Julie Hanks called Benjamin and Kristi Strack's belief in an apocalypse delusional and a sign of mental illness. \\"A lot of parents are concerned about evil in the world, but this is taking it to a whole new level,\\" said Hanks, executive director of Wasatch Family Therapy. \\"Depending on the mental illness, the symptoms can really vary,\\" she said. \\"Some people do not believe they are mentally ill. They think the way that they are thinking and behaving is normal.\\" When a family members begins expressing extreme, rigid beliefs, Hanks said it can be a sign of mental illness. \\"I would encourage you to talk to them with love and just say, 'Hey, I'm concerned about this,'\\" she said. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, KSL encourages you to call the suicide prevention hotline at 1-800-273-TALK.

During the emotional call, she tells the dispatcher the \\"family all killed themselves.\\" Others can be heard yelling and crying in the background. Relatives told investigators that \\"leaving\\" this world had become a fairly common theme with the Strack family leading up to their deaths. But many believed the Stracks only had plans of moving to a sparsely populated area, such as somewhere in Montana, and living \\"off the grid,\\" Finlayson said. Detectives believe Ben Stack was the last person to succumb to the drug overdose. Zion was found on the master bed, on his back with the sheets pulled up to his neck, according to police. Kristi Strack was found on the other side of the bed, also under the sheets. The body of Ben Strack was found on top of the covers, between Zion and Kristi, with one arm and leg partially draped over his wife. Benson's body was found lying on his stomach on a mattress on the floor. Emery's body was found on a mattress under a blanket at the foot of the bed, according to police. The toxic levels of drugs found in Kristi Strack's system were more than what would have been in the bucket, police said. They believe she took methadone separate from what the children were given. Most of the drugs, except the heroin, found in the Stracks' systems were over-the-counter medications. Kristi Strack was a heroin user receiving methadone treatment at the time of her death. There were notebooks with \\"to do lists\\" as if someone were going on vacation, the report states. The note that was found in the house was written by Benson to a friend. \\"The note indicated that Benson was aware that he may die, and was bequeathing his personal possessions to his friend,\\" the chief said. \\"Essentially, yes, it was a goodbye letter to a friend. And it basically mentioned that he would no longer exist on this Earth. Just saying goodbye, and he had an inkling he would be found dead,\\" Ben Strack's brother Jake earlier told KSL News. \\"The apocalyptic beliefs of Ben and Kristi Strack may have played heavily on Benson's writings,\\" Finlayson said. A link to Dan Lafferty During Tuesday's press conference, Finlayson addressed some of the many rumors that his department received following the deaths. Among them was a possible connection between Kristi Strack and one of Utah's most notorious killers, Dan Lafferty. Kristi Strack was a friend of a daughter of Lafferty, and they often visited him in prison. Sometime later, police say both Ben and Kristi Strack visited Lafferty at the prison. While investigators believe the Stracks hadn't seen or had contact with Lafferty since 2008, they still had some type of bond with him. Lafferty had wanted the Stracks to take care of his remains when he died. Finlayson said when his detectives went to the prison to question Lafferty, he seemed genuinely remorseful upon hearing the news of their deaths. It was determined that Lafferty had no knowledge of a mass suicide plan. Police said Lafferty and the Stracks \\"didn't generally\\" talk about apocalyptic ideologies, and Lafferty appeared to have a different view of death than the Stracks. Another prominent rumor was Kristi Strack's cancer. Finlayson said their investigation showed she had ovarian cancer at one time, but was believed to be cancer-free at the time of her death. \\"We express our sincerest condolences to the families of Ben and Kristi Strack. We appreciate their patience and understanding during this long and painful process,\\" the chief said. Finlayson and members of his administration met with Stracks' relatives for a couple of hours prior to Tuesday's press conference. The Strack family again stressed the importance of mental health screenings for loved ones.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Alright, little one, let me explain this to you. So, Japan is a country with its own leaders just like we have our president.

So, they had a big election, which is like a contest where people choose who they want in charge. In this contest, Mr. Noda and his team lost, and another team called the Liberal Democratic Party won instead. Now, a man named Shinzo Abe, who used to be in charge before, will be the leader again. Now that Mr. Abe's team is in charge, they have to work on fixing problems in Japan, like helping people get jobs and keeping everyone safe.

To isolate s, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 32: (32 * s) / 32 = 192 / 32 The 32 on the left side of the equation will cancel out, leaving us with: s = 192 / 32 Now, we need to perform the division on the right side: 192 / 32 = 6 So the equation becomes: s = 6 Therefore, the value of s is 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Make iced coffee. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making iced coffee, follow these steps: 1. Choose your coffee beans: The quality of your coffee beans plays an essential role in the flavor of the iced coffee. Choose high-quality beans from a reputable supplier, and pick a taste that you prefer – be it light, medium, or dark roast. 2. Grind the coffee beans: Using a coffee grinder, grind the beans to a medium or coarse consistency. This allows for better extraction when brewing the coffee. Measure out the appropriate amount – depending on how strong you prefer your coffee, generally one ounce of coffee per four cups of water is a good starting point. 3. Brew the coffee: There are multiple brewing methods you can use for iced coffee, including the following: a. Cold brew: Combine ground coffee with cold water in a jar (one part coffee and four parts water) and let it sit at room temperature for 12-24 hours. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve or a coffee filter to remove the coffee grounds. This will create a cold brew concentrate that can be diluted with water, milk, or a milk alternative. b. Drip coffee maker: Brew your coffee as you normally would, but using either the double-strength method (twice the amount of coffee grounds than you'd usually use, to ensure a stronger flavor) or just the standard brewing method, depending on the intensity desired. c. French Press: Measure the coffee grounds into the French Press and add hot water (just off boiling). Stir and let the coffee steep for four minutes, then press the plunger down to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid. 4. Cool the coffee: Once you have brewed the coffee, let it cool to room temperature. This can take 20-30 minutes depending on the brewing method. You can also put the coffee in the refrigerator to expedite the cooling process. 5. Prepare your serving glass: Grab a glass or a tumbler, and add ice cubes to it. Remember that using larger ice cubes will melt slower and dilute the coffee less. 6. Mix your preferred iced coffee: Pour the cooled coffee over the ice. Depending on whether you made a concentrate or regular-strength coffee, you may need to dilute the drink with water, milk, or a milk alternative. Stir the mixture until well combined. 7. Customize your iced coffee: You can add sweeteners such as simple syrup, honey, maple syrup, or sugar to taste. You can also enhance the flavor with a splash of vanilla extract, chocolate syrup, or caramel sauce. If you prefer a creamier texture, you can add a splash of half-and-half or a milk alternative. 8. Serve and enjoy: Give your iced coffee a final stir, then serve and enjoy! For an added touch, you can garnish your iced coffee with a sprig of mint or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. Remember that iced coffee can be further customized by experimenting with different brewing methods, coffee beans, and added flavors. Personal taste preferences will guide your choices as you work to perfect your ideal iced coffee recipe."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies. - Sinéad Marie Bernadette OConnor (born 8 December 1966) is an Irish singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the late 1980s with her debut album \\"The Lion and the Cobra\\".

It was originally used as the label name by the Dead Kennedys for the self-produced single \\"California Über Alles\\", and after realizing the potential for an independent label, they released records for other bands as well. Dead Kennedys guitarist East Bay Ray and vocalist Jello Biafra formed the original Alternative Tentacles partnership, but the label is now run by Biafra, who became the sole owner in the mid-1980s. Alternative Tentacles no longer owns the rights to Dead Kennedys recordings after a 2000 lawsuit. - Dead Kennedys are an American punk rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1978. The band was one of the first American hardcore bands to make a significant impact in the United Kingdom. - \\"California Über Alles\\" is a song by Dead Kennedys.

Their music occupies the territory where funk, dub, industrial music and electronica intersect. The core members are Doug Wimbish (bass), Keith Leblanc (percussion) and Skip McDonald (guitar) and producer (sometimes credited as \\"mixologist\\") Adrian Sherwood. Despite being short-lived as band proper (there are only two albums credited to the band \\"Tackhead\\"), the legacy and output of these groups of musicians has been prodigious. - Pop Will Eat Itself (also known as PWEI or The Poppies) are an English alternative rock band formed in Stourbridge in 1986 with members from Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country.

Kill The Baddies!\\". After initially disbanding in 1996, and having a brief reformation in 2005, they issued their first release in more than five years in 2010. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. - Coldcut are an English electronic music duo composed of Matt Black and Jonathan More. Credited as pioneers for pop sampling in the 80s, Coldcut are also considered the first stars of UK electronic dance music due to their innovative style, which featured cut-up samples of hip-hop, breaks, jazz, spoken word and various other types of music, as well as video and multimedia. According to \\"Spin\\", \\"in 87 Coldcut pioneered the British fad for DJ records\\". - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection. It is a 'catchall' that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including hip-hop, jazz poetry, poetry slams, traditional poetry readings and can include comedy routines and 'prose monologues'. - Dub is a genre of music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s, and is commonly considered a subgenre, though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae. Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece, and emphasizing the drum and bass parts (this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a 'riddim'). Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo, reverb, panoramic delay, and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. Dub was pioneered by Osbourne \\"King Tubby\\" Ruddock, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock (most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk), pop, hip hop, disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass Traditional dub has survived and some of the originators, such as Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and Mad Professor, continue to produce new material. - Skinny Puppy is a Canadian industrial music group, formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1982. The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (19861995), Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and \\"unofficial\\" fourth member until 1995), Mark Walk (2003present), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (19851986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), and many others. What is the relationship between 'the beatnigs' and 'alternative rock'? Answer:","completion":"The Beatnigs were a San Francisco-based band that combined various music genres including hardcore punk, industrial, and hip-hop influences. They have been described as \\"a kind of avant-garde industrial jazz poets collective.\\" The band was the initial collaboration between Michael Franti and Rono Tse, who later formed The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, as well as Kevin Carnes, who later formed Broun Fellinis. As a precursor to Franti's projects and a fusion of punk, industrial, and hip-hop elements, The Beatnigs can be considered as part of the alternative rock movement. Alternative rock, a broad term used to describe music that diverges from mainstream rock and incorporates a variety of styles such as punk, indie, and experimental sounds, can encompass bands like The Beatnigs who were exploring different musical genres and pushing the boundaries of conventional rock music during their time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No. If I tell you that Grass is a producer in terrestrial biomes, and ask you the question \\"what is a producer in terrestrial biomes?\\", is the correct answer \\"food\\"? Answer:","completion":"The correct answer to the question \\"what is a producer in terrestrial biomes?\\" is neither (a) Yes nor (b) No. Instead, I will provide a detailed answer to elaborate on the concept of a producer in terrestrial biomes. Producers in terrestrial biomes refer to organisms, primarily plants, that can generate their own food through the process of photosynthesis. These organisms are the foundation of food chains in terrestrial ecosystems, as they serve as a primary energy source for consumers such as herbivores. Photosynthesis is an essential process in which plants absorb sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce glucose and oxygen. Producers use glucose as an energy source for their growth and survival, while oxygen is released back into the atmosphere. Food, in this context, refers to the energy obtained by consumers from consuming producers. For example, a herbivore such as a deer consumes grass (the producer) and absorbs energy as its food source. While there is a relationship between producers and food through energy transfer, it is not accurate to define a producer as \\"food.\\" In conclusion, a producer in terrestrial biomes, such as grass, is an organism that generates its own food through photosynthesis and serves as a primary energy source in the food chain. To describe a producer simply as \\"food\\" would not provide a comprehensive understanding of its role within the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is the revised version of the sentence with the appropriate punctuation: \\"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\\" The use of a comma here allows for proper flow and eases the reader's understanding of the two distinct, yet connected, ideas presented in the sentence. The first clause, \\"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge,\\" conveys the notion that prudent individuals acquire knowledge and insight. The second clause, \\"the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge,\\" emphasizes that wise people actively seek out new knowledge to continue expanding their understanding of the world around them. In essence, this sentence highlights the importance of continually pursuing wisdom and knowledge, both for those who are prudent and those who consider themselves wise. By using the comma to separate the two clauses, the reader is better able to grasp the intended meaning and connection between the two concepts. Additionally, it's important to note that this sentence is written using an older style of English, which is why words such as \\"getteth\\" and \\"seeketh\\" are used instead of their modern counterparts, \\"gets\\" and \\"seeks.\\" However, since the original request focused on punctuation correction, I maintained the original style of language used for consistency. In summary, the corrected sentence with proper punctuation is as follows: \\"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\\" This enables the reader to better understand the connection between the two clauses and reinforces the overall message of the sentence, which encourages people to continuously seek knowledge and wisdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whenever an entire industry is beset by scandal, look for the participants who are clean.","completion":"This statement is about finding honest and reliable players in an industry that is currently experiencing widespread scandal. Step 1: Analyze the statement To better understand the task at hand, we first need to analyze the statement. We see that the main idea is to identify individuals or entities in the industry that have not been involved in any wrongdoing or scandal. This suggests that, despite the negative reputation that the industry as a whole may have gained, there are still trustworthy and diligent players worth acknowledging and supporting. Step 2: Research the industry in question Since the industry experiencing the scandal is not mentioned, let's assume there's a hypothetical industry called \\"X.\\" To fulfill the task, I will need to conduct research on all firms, organizations, and prominent figures within industry X. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the current scandal situation and those involved in it. Step 3: Identify known scandals and individuals involved Next, I will compile a list of the major scandals that have affected industry X, as well as the individuals and entities known to be involved. This will allow me to create a database of entities to avoid when searching for clean participants. Step 4: Evaluate the industry players After gathering information on industry X and its scandals, I will carefully evaluate the remaining players. This step involves conducting thorough background checks, reviewing financial statements, analyzing business practices, and seeking any evidence of ethical or legal misconduct. Criteria for this evaluation should include: - Proper licensing and accreditation - Regulatory compliance - Proven track record of integrity - Adherence to industry best practices and ethical standards Step 5: Compile a list of clean participants Once I've completed the evaluation process, I will compile a list of participants in industry X who have shown no involvement in any scandal or wrongdoing. These participants will be considered the \\"clean\\" ones, and their presence may ultimately help to restore trust and confidence in the industry. In conclusion, the statement suggests that it is essential to identify and support the honest and diligent players in an industry experiencing a scandal. By investigating the various entities in such an industry and determining which have remained clean despite the wider controversies, we can reaffirm the belief that not all participants in a scandal-ridden sector are dishonest or untrustworthy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lopes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Wanda Denise (nee Andino), a seamstress, and Ronald Lopes Sr., a US Army staff sergeant, of Portuguese background. She had a younger brother, Ronald Jr., and a younger sister, Raina Anitra (who professionally goes by Reigndrop). Lopes said her father was \\"very strict, very domineering\\" and that he treated the family like they were in \\"boot camp\\". He was a \\"talented musician\\" and played the harmonica, clarinet, piano, and saxophone. At the age of 19, having heard of an open casting call for a new girl group through her then-boyfriend, Lopes moved to Atlanta to audition. Originally starting as a female trio called 2nd Nature, the group had been renamed TLC, derived from the first initials of its members at the time: Tionne, Lisa and Crystal. Things did not work out with Crystal Jones, and TLC's manager Perri \\"Pebbles\\" Reid brought in Damian Dame backup dancer Rozonda Thomas as a third member of the group. To preserve the band's original name, Rozonda needed a name starting with C, and so became Chilli, a name chosen by Lopes. Bandmate Tionne Watkins became T-Boz, derived from the first letter of her first name and \\"Boz\\" (slang for \\"boss\\"). Lopes was renamed \\"Left Eye\\" after a compliment from a man who once told her he was attracted to her because of her left eye. Lopes emphasized her nickname by wearing a pair of glasses with the left lens covered with a condom, in keeping with the group's promotion of safe sex, wearing a black stripe under her left eye, and eventually getting her left eyebrow pierced. The group arrived on the music scene in 1992 with the album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip. With four singles, it sold six million copies worldwide, leading to the group becoming a household name. Two years later CrazySexyCool was released, selling over 23 million copies worldwide, and cemented TLC as one of the biggest female groups of all time. TLC's third album, FanMail, was released in 1999 and sold over 14 million copies worldwide. Its title was a tribute to TLC's loyal fans and the sleeve contained the names of hundreds of them as a \\"thank you\\". During the recording of FanMail, a public conflict began amongst the members of the group. In the May 1999 issue of Vibe magazine, Lopes said, \\"I've graduated from this era. I cannot stand 100 percent behind this TLC project and the music that is supposed to represent me.\\" In response to Lopes' comments, Watkins and Thomas stated to Entertainment Weekly that Lopes \\"doesn't respect the whole group\\" and \\"Left Eye is only concerned with Left Eye.\\" In response, Lopes sent a reply through Entertainment Weekly issuing a \\"challenge\\" to Watkins and Thomas to release solo albums and let the public decide who was the \\"greatest\\" member of TLC: T-Boz and Chilli declined to take up the challenge, though Lopes always maintained it was a great idea. Things were heated between the ladies for some time, with Thomas speaking out against Lopes, calling her antics \\"selfish\\", \\"evil\\", and \\"heartless\\". TLC then addressed these fights by saying that they are very much like sisters that have their disagreements every now and then as Lisa stated, \\"It's deeper than a working relationship. We have feelings for each other, which is why we get so mad at each other. I usually say that you cannot hate someone unless you love them. So, we love each other. That's the problem.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"There's a lot of big words in there, kiddo, but I'll break it down for you! Lisa Lopes, also known as \\"Left Eye,\\" was a very talented lady who loved music and was born in a city called Philadelphia. Her mom was a seamstress, meaning she sewed clothes, and her dad was a very strict soldier. Her dad could play lots of instruments like the harmonica, which is a little metal thing you blow into to make music, and the piano, which has lots of keys to press for different sounds. When Lisa was a bit older, she heard about a chance to join a girls singing group. She moved to a city called Atlanta and joined a group that was first called 2nd Nature but later changed their name to TLC. The name TLC came from the first letters of each girl's name - Tionne, Lisa, and Crystal. But Crystal left, and a new girl named Rozonda, or \\"Chilli,\\" joined instead. Lisa got her nickname, \\"Left Eye,\\" because a man once told her that he liked her left eye. She liked the name and even began to wear glasses with a covered left lens and a black stripe under her left eye as a kind of special mark. TLC became very famous and sold lots of their music. They even named one of their albums \\"FanMail\\" to say thank you to all their fans. But sometimes, like any friends, they would fight and say mean things to each other. Even though they fought, Lisa once said that they loved each other, and that's why their fights hurt so much. So, that's the story of Lisa Lopes and her music group, TLC.

Given the two facts above, what requires energy to produce light? Answer:","completion":"A light bulb requires energy to produce light, as established by Fact 1. Understanding this concept necessitates an examination of the underlying principles and processes that allow a light bulb to convert electrical energy into visible light, as indicated by Fact 2. To produce light, a light bulb typically uses one of the following technologies: incandescent, fluorescent, light-emitting diode (LED), or halogen. While these technologies differ in terms of efficiency, lifespan, and light output, they all require energy to generate light. 1. Incandescent Light Bulbs: An incandescent light bulb consists of a thin tungsten filament housed within an inert glass envelope. When electrical energy is supplied to the bulb, the filament heats up due to electrical resistance. The heated filament then emits light through a process called incandescence. This process entails that the filament, when sufficiently heated, produces both heat and visible light as a result of its increased temperature. 2. Fluorescent Light Bulbs: In contrast to incandescent bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs use electrical energy to excite mercury vapor within a phosphor-coated glass tube. When the mercury atoms become excited, they emit ultraviolet (UV) light, which is then absorbed by the phosphor coating. The absorbed UV light causes the phosphor coating to emit visible light through a process called fluorescence, which is more energy-efficient than incandescence. 3. Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Light Bulbs: LEDs utilize semiconductor materials, such as gallium arsenide or silicon carbide, to create electroluminescence. When electrical energy is applied to the semiconductor, electrons recombine with electron holes within the material, releasing energy in the process. This energy is emitted as light in the visible spectrum. Due to their superior efficiency and long lifespan, LED light bulbs are becoming increasingly popular. 4. Halogen Light Bulbs: These bulbs are similar to incandescent bulbs in that they use a tungsten filament. However, they differ in that they contain a halogen gas, such as iodine or bromine, within the glass envelope. The halogen gas forms a chemical reaction with the evaporated tungsten atoms, allowing them to be redeposited on the filament. This increases the life of the filament and allows the bulb to operate at a higher temperature, resulting in a brighter and whiter light compared to a standard incandescent. Considering these technologies, it is evident that different mechanisms are employed to convert electrical energy into visible light. Regardless of the specific technology, all light bulbs require energy input to generate the desired light output, reaffirming that energy is a fundamental prerequisite for producing light in a light bulb."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While no specific details have been provided about the measures that will be implemented to facilitate this review, some general steps will likely need to be undertaken. 1. Collecting information: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the various issues and employment practices, Sports Direct will need to collect extensive information about its agency workers, such as their current contracts, benefits, working hours, and conditions. 2. Analyzing data: Once the data has been acquired, the company will need to carefully analyze it in order to identify any potential areas for improvement, such as inadequate benefits, unfair working schedules, and poor employment conditions. 3. Engaging in discussions: To ensure transparency and inclusiveness, the company will likely engage in open dialogue with agency workers and potentially, their respective labor unions. By discussing the concerns raised, Sports Direct can begin working on ways to address and resolve these issues. 4. Implementing changes: Based on the feedback received and data analyzed, Sports Direct will then implement necessary changes to the employment terms and conditions of its agency workers. This may include increasing benefits, adjusting work schedules, and improving overall working conditions. 5. Monitoring progress: To ensure that improvements are being made, the company will need to maintain regular checks on its agency workers and their conditions.

The way the light reflected off the ripples of the water seemed to breathe life into the landscape, making it look almost ethereal. Taking a step back to absorb the complete view, Sarah's eyes wandered over the fine details she had spent hours perfecting: the delicate blending of blues, purples, and grays that comprised the clouds; the expertly rendered texture of the rugged mountain peaks that loomed majestically in the background; and the intricate patterns of light and shadow that served to guide the viewer's eye to the lake's quiet shore. As her gaze lingered on the painting's representation of a small, rustically charming cabin nestled on the lakeshore, she recalled the summer she spent there with her late grandmother - recalling their walks through the dense forest, the smell of the damp earth and pine needles beneath their feet, and the laughter shared as they cast their fishing lines into the water. Feeling the familiar pang of nostalgia well up within her, Sarah knew that she had immortalized more than just a picturesque scene on canvas; she had captured a moment in time, a memory shared with her beloved grandmother who had been an avid art lover and nature enthusiast.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What concession did Notre Dame make in order to keep their football affiliation?\\" is in \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

However, a more detailed and comprehensive response is provided below for better understanding. CJIS, or Criminal Justice Information Services, refers to a division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that manages a suite of criminal justice databases and services. These databases and services are essential tools for state and local law enforcement, as well as other criminal justice agencies across the United States. One critical component of CJIS is the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a computerized index of criminal justice information. The information contained in the NCIC is available to Federal, state, local, and tribal criminal justice agencies for the specific purpose of enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their law enforcement efforts. The NCIC database contains millions of records that can be accessed by the appropriate criminal justice departments, including: 1. Criminal record histories 2. Fingerprint records 3. Stolen vehicles, firearms, boats, and other property information 4. Wanted person information 5. Missing person information 6. Protection orders 7. Sex offender registry 8. Gang and terrorist group affiliations In addition to NCIC, CJIS also provides other services and tools like the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. States and local agencies can access and contribute to CJIS databases through secure and authorized connections. These connections are established through the use of Criminal Justice Information Services Security Policy, which sets the guidelines and requirements for securing and accessing the systems. To obtain access to CJIS, agencies must meet specific requirements, and they must adhere to strict security protocols to ensure the information is not compromised. In summary, state and local agencies indeed have access to CJIS, which includes various databases and services used for criminal justice purposes. These agencies can both access and contribute information to the system, adhering to stringent security protocols to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the data."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Chrisye was born Christian Rahardi in Jakarta on 16 September 1949 to Laurens Rahadi, a Chinese-Betawi entrepreneur, and Hanna Rahadi, a Chinese-Sundanese housewife. He was the second of three sons born to the couple; his brothers were Joris and Vicky. The family lived on Talang Street near Menteng, Central Jakarta, until 1954, when they moved to Pegangsaan Street (also in Menteng). While attending GIKI Elementary School, Chrisye befriended the neighbouring Nasution family; he became especially close to Bamid Gauri, with whom he played badminton and flew kites. Context: Chrisye's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy. Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies. The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May. After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language \\"To My Friends on Legian Beach\\". Two of the songs, \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" (\\"Galih and Ratna\\") and \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\"), were used in the 1979 film Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song from High School); Chrisye played a minor part in the film's sequel, Puspa Indah Taman Hati (Beautiful Flower in the Heart's Garden), as a singer. Due in part to the popularity of the film, Puspa Indah was well received and sold well; \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" and \\"Gita Cinta\\", released as singles, were also commercially successful. In 1980 Chrisye appeared in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS that it would be fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical. Question: what is the title of this album?.

Context: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court.

Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The Counsel Members tries to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team. Days after the hunting trip, there is a kiss between the king and Gong-gil. Then, she...

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions, but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia, and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands. Between 35°N and 35°S, glaciers occur only in the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky Mountains, a few high mountains in East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran. Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface. Continental glaciers cover nearly 13,000,000 km2 (5×10^6 sq mi) or about 98 percent of Antarctica's 13,200,000 km2 (5.1×10^6 sq mi), with an average thickness of 2,100 m (7,000 ft). Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers.\\"?

Answer:","completion":"Title: Almost Perfect Messaging App Review: I have been using the org.telegram.messenger app for a few months now and I must say, it's quickly becoming a favorite! The interface is clean, user-friendly, and very intuitive. The messaging features, including voice and video calls, work seamlessly and fast. The security measures they've implemented, like end-to-end encryption, are commendable and give me peace of mind while using the app. However, there is some room for improvement, which is why I'm giving it a 4-star rating. The app does tend to drain my phone's battery a bit more than I'd like, specifically during long video calls. Additionally, I've noticed that transferring large files could be faster, and I'd love to see some more customization options like chat folder organization and better sticker management. All in all, the org.telegram.messenger app has been a great find. It's almost perfect and with just a few tweaks, it could truly become a 5-star messaging app!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
