PwC chief economist Esmond Birnie said: \\"Add a young and mobile workforce who often prefer high-quality rental apartments to purchasing terraced properties and we are seeing a generation that perceives private renting as a real option to property ownership.\\" Home ownership in London is currently around 46% and in ten years' time, PwC predicts it will have dropped to 40%.","completion":"In a place called Northern Ireland, many people used to own their houses.

In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about.

The war initially began between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, but it quickly escalated as countries with mutual defense pacts entered the conflict.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

Q: Which part of a neuron contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles? A:","completion":"A: The part of a neuron that contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles is known as the soma or cell body. The soma serves as the control center for the neuron, playing a vital role in maintaining the cell's structural integrity, regulating its function, and coordinating its metabolic processes. The nucleus, which is housed within the soma, is responsible for governing the cell's overall activities and for storing the genetic material necessary for the neuron to function. Contained within the nucleus, the cell's DNA is used to synthesize a variety of proteins that are essential for the neuron's structure and function. The nucleolus, a dense structure located within the nucleus, is where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is produced, a critical component in protein synthesis. Other important organelles found within the soma also play crucial roles in a neuron's function. These include: 1. Mitochondria: Often referred to as the cell's \\"powerhouse\\", these organelles produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of energy for various cellular processes. 2. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): The ER is an extensive network of membrane-enclosed sacs and tubules involved in the synthesis and processing of proteins and lipids. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) primarily aids in lipid synthesis and calcium storage, while the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), studded with ribosomes, is responsible for protein synthesis and processing. 3. Golgi Apparatus: This organelle is primarily involved in processing, modifying, and packaging proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER, before transporting them to their target destinations within or outside the cell. 4. Lysosomes and Peroxisomes: These digestive organelles degrade cellular waste materials, ingested pathogens, and old organelles to recycle their building blocks and maintain the cell's optimal functioning. 5. Cytoskeleton: Composed of various protein fibrils such as microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin filaments, the cytoskeleton provides structural support, helps maintain cell shape, and plays a critical role in intracellular transport and cell division. Overall, the soma or cell body is the central hub of the neuron, providing the necessary infrastructure for the cell's survival, compartmentalizing and coordinating metabolic processes, and facilitating communication with other neurons. Ultimately, the health and functionality of the neuron rely heavily on the integrity and efficiency of the complex assortment of organelles within its soma."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who began investigating the costs of the capitol project? William H. Berry was elected in 1906, shortly after the dedication, to the office of State Treasurer on a reform \\"fusion ticket\\". Berry was the only Democrat elected to a statewide office from 1895 to 1934. His successful campaign was deemed by Governor Pennypacker to be \\"one of those freaks of ill fortune\\". Berry began investigating the costs of the capitol project and brought its 13 million pricetag to the attention of the public. Part of the reason for the discrepancy was Pennsylvania's \\"over-elaborate\\" and sometimes \\"unintelligible\\" method of \\"ordering and purchasing supplies, equipment [and] furnishings, commonly called the 'per-foot rule' \\". Because the methods of measuring under the \\"per-foot rule\\" were not rigorously enforced, furnishing could be, intentionally, overpriced by the supplier. For example, a flagpole installed on the capitol roof was priced at 850; Berry estimated the value of the pole to have been only 150. Other expenses included 1,619 for a 125 bootblack stand and 3,257 for a 325 \\"mahogany case in the Senate barber shop\\".Pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with the capitol were reasonable in comparison with similar notable structures. He pointed out that the United States Capitol cost 18 million, but had \\"fifty-five less [rooms] than the Capitol at Harrisburg.\\" Pennypacker also showed how the New York State Capitol had cost 24 million, and was still unfinished. After an investigation, a total of five people, including Huston, were convicted, on December 18, 1908, and sentenced to two years in prison for \\"conspiring with State officials to defraud the State in the erection and furnishing of the Capitol.\\" The Superintendent of Public Ground and Buildings James Shumaker and Auditor General William P. Snyder were also convicted. Among the convicted, John H. Sanderson and William L. Mathues died before going to prison.

He buys an air compressor so he can air clean all of the dust from his computer. The compressor forces high powered streams of air by compressing the air inside it then releasing it through a tube. and a hint : Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. Please answer this question : Will decreasing pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant increase or decrease its volume? The answer is:","completion":"Decreasing the pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant will increase its volume. This relationship between pressure and volume is described by Boyle's Law, which states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. In an inverse relationship, as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Applying this concept to Boyle's Law, if the pressure of a container of gas decreases, the volume of the gas will increase, assuming the temperature remains constant. When Aaron uses the air compressor to clean his computer, the air inside is compressed and then released through a tube as high powered streams of air. In this process, the air compressor temporarily increases the pressure of the air, resulting in a decrease in volume.

This House believes that religious beliefs should override government laws What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"An argument in favor of the statement that religious beliefs should override government laws could be based upon the following points: Step 1: Establish the foundation of religious belief Since religious beliefs are often founded on an individual's spiritual and moral convictions, it can be argued that they represent the ultimate truth and guidance for human beings. This can be backed up by the fact that major world religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism have existed for centuries and continue to garner followers, implying that they carry some inherent value and wisdom. Step 2: Focus on ethical and moral guidance The argument can be made that the ethical and moral principles derived from religious beliefs provide a strong moral compass for many, guiding them towards virtuous behavior. In many instances, religious principles could be considered a higher authority than the government, especially when government laws may, on occasion, conflict with these morals. Step 3: Highlight subjective nature of law Emphasize that laws are created by people and are subject to change over time, whereas religious beliefs derive from divine or spiritual sources, which remain unchanging and constant. Given the impermanence and subjective nature of laws, individuals may find solace and clarity in the consistent nature of religious beliefs. Step 4: Point to historical examples Provide historical examples where following religious beliefs or principles led to positive change and moral progress. For example, the abolitionist movement in the United States, where many of its proponents, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, based their opposition to slavery on religious convictions. This example highlights the potential for religious beliefs to serve as a catalyst for societal change and improvements, even when government laws might not align with these beliefs. Step 5: Address potential concerns about religious extremism Acknowledge that the idea of religious beliefs overriding government laws might raise concerns about religious extremism. However, argue that the majority of religious followers espouse moderation and peaceful coexistence. In this context, separating religion from radicalism is important for understanding the positive impact that adhering to religious beliefs can have on personal and societal ethics. In conclusion, one could argue that religious beliefs should override government laws based on their spiritual and moral foundation, historical examples of positive societal change, and the potential for providing a stable moral compass. However, it is important to address and navigate the potential negative implications of religious extremism in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Diplomacy is failing to protect the United States' trade secrets At the moment, hacking is top of mind for the American public, and companies are spending more on security than ever before. But has the problem gotten any better? Not quite. Last year the number of cyberespionage incidents confirmed by Verizon in its latest data breach investigations report increased to 548 from 511 the year prior. And even though research firm Gartner predicts that information security spending will grow this year to 76.9 billion from 71.1 billion a year ago—an 8.2% increase—the problem persists. State sponsored attackers continue to loot corporate networks for classified information, seeking commercial, military, and political advantage. Type of data stolen through cyberespionage.Courtesy of Verizon How has the U.S. handled this threat to its economic well-being? Back in Feb. 2013, President Barack Obama unveiled a plan to beat back cyberespionage. “Trade secret theft threatens American businesses, undermines national security, and places the security of the U.S. economy in jeopardy,” the administration’s strategy document said. “These acts also diminish U.S. export prospects around the globe and put American jobs at risk.” The plan laid out five ways the U.S. would counter industrial spying. They can be summed up as: The country has, to be sure, made progress in some of these areas. A recent executive order imbued the Treasury with the power to sanction “individuals or entities that engage in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.” Congress has upped maximum penalties and fines for individuals found guilty of any kind of economic espionage by tenfold to 5 million (and 10 million for organizations). And the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been aggressively pursuing economic snoops. “The agency reported a 60 percent increase in trade secret investigations from 2009 through 2013,” as the New York Times points out. But even as the prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act have increased, the Justice Department has had difficulty indicting people for online theft of trade secrets. “During the first nine months of [2014], the Justice Department reported 20 new prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act — a 33 percent increase from 2013 — and several convictions,” writes Nicole Perlroth, “but only two of the indictments involved trade secrets theft via digital intrusions.” The two cases comprise last year’s indictment of five Chinese nationals for hacking and stealing secrets from various businesses such as Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, and the August indictment of another Chinese national, Su Bin, for doing the same to defense contractors such as Boeing. The U.S. has had no authority to extradite the former from China, while the latter awaits extradition in Canada. In its latest “301 report” on protecting intellectual property, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which negotiates on trade agreements with foreign governments, places China atop its “priority watch list” alongside nine other countries. Some of the countries—Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey—have remained on that list every year since the first report came out in 1989. It’s clear that diplomacy—the administration’s priority numero uno for combating digital economic espionage, and the approach with the best chance at success given the U.S.’s lack of enforcement authority abroad—has not been very successful to date. Cyberespionage is still on the rise, and the same countries appear to be to blame. It’s possible that the executive branch’s newly approved power to impose financial and travel sanctions on perpetrators may change the game. But that solution faces challenges, too. As Verizon’s report reveals, not knowing who’s behind a hacking remains a problem: “Two-thirds of the incidents in this pattern had no attacker-attribution information whatsoever,” the report says in the cyberespionage section. That’s a lot of whodunnit. For the time being, diplomacy will likely remain the U.S.’s best option in combatting cyberspies. That said: Without the requisite muscle or confidence in attribution, it’s bound to continue to be ineffectual. States will just continue to evade and parry accusations of hacking. “Conditions are likely to deteriorate,” the 301 report says, less than optimistically, “as long as those committing such thefts, and those benefitting, continue to operate with relative impunity.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Diplomacy has so far failed to protect the United States' trade secrets from cyberespionage, as state-sponsored attackers continue to target corporate networks for classified information. Despite increased information security spending and some progress in sanctioning malicious cyber activities, challenges in attribution and lack of enforcement authority abroad hinder diplomatic efforts to combat digital economic espionage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to sine and cosine, what is the third main function of trigonometry?","completion":"The third main function of trigonometry is tangent. Tangent, often abbreviated as \\"tan\\", is a primary function in trigonometry that, along with sine and cosine, forms the basis of all other trigonometric functions. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In mathematical notation, if we denote the angle as θ, the side opposite the angle as O, and the adjacent side as A, then we represent the tangent of an angle as: tan(θ) = O/A In simpler terms, the tangent of an angle is the slope of the line from the origin to the point on the unit circle at that angle. It's important to understand that the tangent function repeats its values every 180 degrees (or π radians), so the graph of the tangent function has asymptotes, or lines which the graph approaches but never touches, at every multiple of 90 degrees (or π/2 radians). The tangent function is unique in comparison to the sine and cosine functions because it isn't limited to values between -1 and 1. Instead, its range extends indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. A good way to remember the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent is through the acronym SOHCAHTOA, which stands for \\"sine equals opposite over hypotenuse, cosine equals adjacent over hypotenuse, and tangent equals opposite over adjacent.\\" It's important to note that tangent function also has a reciprocal function, called cotangent (often abbreviated as \\"cot\\"), which is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the side opposite the angle, or: cot(θ) = A/O These three functions - sine, cosine, and tangent - provide the foundation for many branches of mathematics, including calculus, vector analysis, and complex number theory, and have numerous applications in physics, engineering, computer science, and other fields that deal with wave patterns, cycles, and circular motion.

Her father, a disc jockey, often took his daughter to work with him to help choose records to play on the air. Womack was the second of two daughters. Womack released her self-titled debut album in May 1997, produced by Mark Wright. The album consisted of self-penned material as well as songs written by other artists, including Mark Chesnutt, Ricky Skaggs, and Sharon White. The first single, \\"Never Again, Again\\" made the country charts and playlists by March 1997, which led to the release of the album's second single, \\"The Fool\\" shortly afterward. More successful than her first single, \\"The Fool\\" reached the Top 5 on the Billboard Country chart that year. That year she won major awards from the country music community; Top New Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music Awards, Top Artist of the Year from Billboard Magazine, and was nominated for the Horizon award by the Country Music Association. Decca Nashville decided to close its doors in 1998, moving Womack to MCA Nashville Records that year. In 1998, Womack released her second studio album, Some Things I Know, which was also produced by Wright. The album's first two singles, \\"A Little Past Little Rock\\" and \\"I'll Think of a Reason Later\\" both went to No. 2 on the Billboard Country Chart. Two additional singles, \\"(Now You See Me) Now You Don't\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" were released in 1999, and the album was certified Gold by the RIAA soon after. That year, she also won Favorite Country New Artist from the American Music Awards. Womack also contributed her vocals to the songs \\"If You're Ever Down in Dallas\\" and \\"The Man Who Made Mama Cry\\" in collaboration with her ex-husband and musician, Jason Sellers. The material was promoted through shows through October to November before the birth of Womack's second child in January 1999.","completion":"This text is about a lady named Womack who is a country music singer.

(CNN) -- With Walter White dead, fans everywhere are mourning, celebrating, tallying up bets and discussing what just happened. Was the series finale of \\"Breaking Bad\\" satisfying? Did it tie up all loose ends? Did the character you wanted to live survive and did the ones you wanted to die get their just deserts? Is it sending you back to the beginning to binge watch it all over again? Just when it seemed Walt was heading out of his New Hampshire hideaway to exact revenge on Elliot and Gretchen Schwartz (for dismissing his involvement with Gray Matter Technologies in the episode previous), he pulled the first of several surprises of the evening. Instead of threatening to kill them outright, he asks them to set up a trust fund so that his children would benefit from the money he'd illegally amassed (presumably the goal of his entire meth enterprise to begin with). Gretchen and Elliott of course are terrified by his sudden appearance in their ritzy new home, but had they been paying attention, they would have seen Walt waltz on in. His entrance is a bit ironic, considering their wealth and legitimacy is in some way a result of his earlier contributions. He's always been there, in the shadows, whether they acknowledged him or not. Bryan Cranston, man of the moment Walt wants them to \\"make it right,\\" but of course, he knows he can't trust them to take care of his kids on a handshake alone, so he brought backup -- two \\"hitmen\\" who shine sniper-style red lights on the Schwartzes to lend credibility to Walt's threat that if for any reason his children don't receive the money, \\"a kind of countdown begins,\\" in which they would be killed. It's a bluff, but they don't know that, so it's a win-win. Walt's children will get the money in a semi-legal fashion, and no one will actually die in the process. 1. Who is Bryan Cranston? 2.

The Piazza delle Erbe, also known as the Market Square, is one of the three significant and interconnected piazzas in San Gimignano, Italy. The other two piazzas mentioned here are the Piazza della Cisterna and the Piazza del Duomo. Each piazza serves a different purpose and is characterized by unique architectural and historical elements. Piazza della Cisterna gets its name from a 13th-century travertine well and is surrounded by elegant palaces. This beautiful triangular square is a central meeting point for both tourists and locals. It represents the social and commercial heart of the city. Piazza del Duomo, the religious and civic center of power, houses both the church and town hall. The Duomo, also known as the Collegiate Church, is a fine example of Romanesque architecture, featuring beautiful frescoes and artworks. The town hall, on the other hand, represents the secular power and authority in the city. The Piazza delle Erbe was historically the place where local farmers and merchants would come together to trade and sell their goods, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and other necessities. The twin Salvucci towers stand tall within this piazza, making it easily recognizable. These two towers were initially constructed as a symbol of power and wealth by the Salvucci family, a prominent noble family in San Gimignano. All three piazzas are interconnected architecturally and historically, forming an essential part of San Gimignano's layout, cultural identity, and social fabric. The statement that \\"The Piazza delle Erbe is home to a marketplace and a pair of towers\\" is accurate, as the piazza is characterized by the presence of the market and the distinctive Salvucci towers that serve as a symbol of power and architecture worthy of this remarkable Tuscan town."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him. She quickly breaks away, and says she cannot see him any more. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who sinks into a deep depression is Lorna.

Q: Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The... According to the above context, answer the following question. After cooking vegetables, they are probably: The answer is:","completion":"After cooking vegetables, they are probably experiencing some degree of nutrient loss due to exposure to heat, oxygen, or light. However, cooking also increases the digestibility of the vegetables, making it easier for our bodies to absorb the available nutrients. While some enzymes and nutrients may be lost during cooking, the availability of certain phytonutrients increases, and harmful microbes that can cause food poisoning are killed. Therefore, it's a trade-off between nutrient loss and increased digestibility and safety."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I asked Elsie for taster cups and she handed me 2 without a smile or any type of greeting. I sampled cheesecake and pistachio first and didn't want either. The cheesecake flavor was too sweet which made it taste artificial and the pistachio flavor was too tame for me. Next, I had caramel corn and chocolate. The caramel corn refreshingly matched the taste of real caramel corn without being overly sweet and the chocolate didn't taste like a true chocolate. I decided on the caramel corn with white chocolates chips; sliced almonds; granola. I noticed the chocolate chips had a white coating and asked Elsie about it. She said it was probably a bad batch but they were still good. They still looked unappetizing and it made me question how fresh their other toppings are. As my friend and I were sitting down she said there are dirty toe nails on the ground. I looked down and saw at least 5 dirty big nails. I was appalled and told Elsie, she said she literally just got here and has been busy ever since. Whatever the reason she should have apologized instead of giving excuses and gone right away to clean them up. Those toe nails looked like they had been there for days and the entire time we were there she never cleaned them up. It's too bad because I enjoyed my yogurt enough to come back.","completion":"The review appears to be predominantly negative. The reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects, such as the caramel corn yogurt flavor, but the overall sentiment leans towards dissatisfaction. The reviewer mentions several points of criticism: 1. The layout of the yogurt shop is described as generic, which may be perceived as uninspired or lacking in originality. 2. The reviewer did not find the cheesecake and pistachio flavors appealing, as they were deemed too sweet and too weak, respectively. 3. The staff member, Elsie, was portrayed as unenthusiastic and unhelpful. 4. The chocolate chips were criticized for their unappetizing appearance. 5. The presence of dirty toenails on the floor raised concerns about the overall cleanliness of the establishment. Additionally, the reviewer implies that Elsie offered excuses instead of an apology for the toenails' presence on the floor, and the problem was not resolved during their visit. This further contributes to the negative sentiment of the review. Despite the reviewer stating that they enjoyed the caramel corn yogurt enough to potentially come back, the negative aspects highlighted are likely to overshadow the positive elements and discourage them from becoming a repeat customer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But you told me to smoke one cigar a day, and that almost killed me at first. It was not easy to begin smoking at my age.\\" One day an Indian _ . . A) went to see a friend B) felt very tired C) wasn't feeling well D) went to help his doctor Answer:","completion":"One day an Indian (C) wasn't feeling well. He decided it was time to go see his doctor to seek advice and possible treatment to alleviate his symptoms. Upon arrival, he was examined by the doctor, who concluded that medication was not the solution to the man's issues. The doctor recommended that the Indian take a change of pace for his overall wellbeing. Specifically, the doctor instructed him to go to a serene country location for one month, establish a healthier bedtime routine, consume milk, engage in regular exercise through walking, and limit himself to only one cigar each day. The Indian, trusting the expertise of his doctor, took the advice to heart and followed through with the recommendations. A month later, he returned to see the doctor, who was pleased to observe the visible improvement in the man's physical appearance. The Indian seemed rejuvenated, which the doctor attributed to the implemented lifestyle changes. The Indian confirmed this by expressing his gratitude and sharing that he had indeed experienced a restful period, established an early bedtime, drank copious amounts of milk, and walked frequently. However, the Indian also mentioned that the doctor's advice to smoke one cigar a day had proven to be a significant challenge initially. As a non-smoker, he found it difficult to adjust and adopt this habit, especially at his age. The doctor was surprised to hear this but was pleased with the overall results of his recommendations in improving the Indian's health and wellbeing. In conclusion, one day an Indian (C) wasn't feeling well and sought help from his doctor. Following the doctor's advice, the man experienced significant improvements in his health, despite the unexpected challenge of beginning to smoke cigars later in life. The experience underscores the importance of taking a holistic approach to health and acknowledging that making changes in multiple aspects of one's lifestyle can contribute to improved overall wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: measure the voltage B: rewire the house C: make the power Answer:","completion":"A: measure the voltage Step 1: Analyze the context - In the context, Sasha has just finished rewiring the house for electricity and tested every outlet. Step 2: Anticipate the possible next tasks - After rewiring and testing all the outlets, Sasha might want to ensure that every outlet is working correctly and safely. Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice: A: measure the voltage - Measuring the voltage can help Sasha confirm that the outlets were wired correctly and can handle the electrical load they are supposed to. This step makes sense after testing the outlets. B: rewire the house - Since Sasha just finished rewiring the house, it's unlikely that she would want to rewire the house again right after completing this task.

Unlike ABC, CBS and NBC, Fox does not currently air national news programs (morning, evening or overnight) or newsmagazines -- choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule, sports and other ancillary network programming. The absence of a national news program on the Fox network is despite the fact that its parent company, 21st Century Fox, owns Fox News Channel, which launched in August 1996 and currently maintains near-universal distribution within the United States via pay television providers. Fox News is not structured as a news division of the Fox network, and operates as a technically separate entity within 21st Century Fox through the company's Fox News Group subsidiary. However, it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network, which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel; in particular, FNC anchor Shepard Smith anchors most prime time news presentations on the Fox network, especially during political news events (which are anchored by Bret Baier on Fox News Channel).

What is the name of the person Holly was asked to check on? Answer the above question based on the context below: In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon. Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days. In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"The population of India in 1980 was approximately 683.3 million people, according to the World Bank. India has experienced rapid population growth over the past few decades, driven by factors such as higher fertility rates, improved health care, and economic development. As of 2021, the recent population of India is estimated to be around 1.366 billion people, making it the second most populous country in the world after China. It is projected that India may overtake China in terms of population within a few years. As for the two questions, they concern the population of India but refer to different time periods. The first question asks for the population in the year 1980, while the second question seeks information about the recent population of India. In this sense, the two questions are not the same, because they pertain to different data points of Indian population over time. It is important to understand the distinction between the two questions as it allows us to recognize the historic progress and demographic changes in India. While the specific population number may vary from year to year, studying the data from 1980 and comparing it to more recent statistics enables us to analyze the growth trend and the factors that have contributed to India's immense population increase in the past few decades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Product review: I don't see why they even bothered releasing this album. It was a complete waste of time seeing as how Jon Bonham died two years before and Robert and Jimi didn't like each other very much. I think this one didn't even go gold. Answer:","completion":"Based on this particular review, the chances of me buying the product would likely decrease. However, it is essential to analyze the given review to understand the reasons behind this deduction. Firstly, the review title \\"Your career is over, get over it!\\" telegraphs a strong negative sentiment which indicates that the reviewer was not happy or satisfied with the album. This negative perception from the reviewer instills a sense of doubt regarding the quality and the overall appeal of the product. Next, the actual content of the product review highlights a few critical points. The reviewer states that they don't understand why the album was even released, claiming it to be a waste of time. This statement suggests that the reviewer believes that the album's content is not worth investing time or money in. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that Jon Bonham, a member of the band, passed away two years before the album's release, and the remaining members, Robert and Jimi, did not get along well. It could be inferred from this information that the group dynamics at the time of the recording might have compromised the quality and the cohesiveness of the music. Lastly, the reviewer mentions that the album didn't even go gold. This piece of information implies that the album did not receive substantial commercial success or positive critical reception. This lack of recognition and achievement again casts doubts on the album's overall quality and appeal to the listeners. However, it is always important to consider multiple perspectives before making a final decision. A single review may not accurately represent the collective opinion of the product's target audience. Therefore, one should read multiple reviews to gather a more balanced understanding of the product's pros and cons. Additionally, personal preferences and tastes play a significant role in determining whether a product will satisfy one's expectations.

What did John pull open? Options: - closet - chest - drawer - dresser - suitcase The answer is \\"drawer\\" because A:","completion":"The phrase \\"looking for a shirt, so he pulled open this\\" refers to an action where an item typically used for clothing storage was used. While it is true that a shirt can be stored in all the item options provided - a closet, a chest, a drawer, a dresser, or a suitcase - the use of the verb 'pulled open' provides the best clue in this situation. Let's examine each option more carefully: 1. Closet: In typical usage, a closet is not usually described as being 'pulled open'. Rather, closets are usually constructed with doors that swing open or slide side to side. As such, we often use the verbs 'open' or 'slide' to refer to accessing a closet. Therefore, the phrase \\"pulled open\\" doesn't match well with the use of a closet. 2. Chest: Chests can indeed be 'pulled open', but they are more often associated with larger items, keepsakes, or items not frequently accessed. While you can store clothes in a chest, it's less common to do so, especially for items like shirts that you would need to access frequently. 3. Drawer: Drawers are commonly 'pulled open', and in most home environments, shirts are commonly stored in dressers or chests of drawers. The pulling action matches the operation of most drawers, which are slid out (or pulled open) from a piece of furniture such as a dresser or a chest of drawers. 4. Dresser: Although a dresser may sound like a viable answer, we typically consider a dresser to be made up of multiple drawers. Therefore, we wouldn't generally say that we're 'pulling open' a dresser — instead, we pull open the drawers of a dresser. 5. Suitcase: While a suitcase can be 'pulled open', it is not a common place to store shirts, especially not in a home setting where other storage options, like drawers, are available. Usually, you keep clothes in a suitcase when you are traveling. In conclusion, considering the verb 'pulled open' and the context of looking for a shirt at presumably home, 'drawer' is the most fitting answer among the options given. Hence, the statement \\"John was looking for a shirt, so he pulled open this. What did John pull open?\\" is best answered with 'drawer'."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The most suitable option in this context would be a \\"stringed instrument.\\" This choice makes the most sense because the terms \\"neck\\" and \\"bridge\\" are commonly used to describe parts of a stringed instrument, such as a guitar, violin, or cello. The neck is the elongated, slender part of the instrument where the strings rest, while the bridge is a component that supports the strings and transfers their vibrations to the instrument's body. The act of \\"playing\\" further supports this option, as one can physically interact with and produce sound from a stringed instrument by plucking or bowing its strings. The other options do not fit the context as easily: - Tunnel: While one could admire the design or construction of a tunnel, there isn't a physical action comparable to \\"playing\\" involved in engaging with a tunnel. - Transportation system: Similar to the tunnel, one can admire the function and design of a transportation system, but \\"playing\\" wouldn't be an appropriate way to interact with it. - Spectacles: Admiring spectacles refers to eyeglasses, and though one might appreciate the craftsmanship of a pair of glasses, \\"playing\\" them doesn't align with their purpose. - Radio: The act of playing a radio could refer to turning it on and listening to music or broadcasts.

It has an orbital period of 139705000.0 and an epoch date of December 31st 2006. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"Several important pieces of data about 109 Felicitas, a celestial object, can be extracted from the given sentence, and they are described as follows: 1. 109 Felicitas is the name of the celestial object being described. The number '109' implies that it is the 109th discovered object of its type, most likely an asteroid. The name 'Felicitas' signifies it has been named after a specific person, concept, or entity. 2. Periapsis: The sentence provides the periapsis of 109 Felicitas, which is 283,326,000,000.0 (283.326 billion). The periapsis refers to the point in the orbit of a celestial body where it is nearest to the body it is orbiting. The unit of measurement for this periapsis data, however, has not been provided in the sentence. In the case of an asteroid, the periapsis typically refers to its closest approach to the Sun in its orbit. 3. Apoapsis: The apoapsis of 109 Felicitas is given as 523,329,000 kilometers. Apoapsis is the point in the orbit of a celestial body where it is farthest from the body it is orbiting. For an asteroid, the apoapsis usually refers to its farthest distance from the Sun in its orbit. So, 109 Felicitas has an apoapsis distance of about 523.329 million kilometers away from the Sun at its farthest point. 4. Orbital period: The orbital period of 109 Felicitas is provided as 139,705,000.0 (139.705 million), but the unit of measurement is not specified. The orbital period refers to the time it takes for a celestial object to complete one full orbit around the body it's orbiting. In this case, it represents the time it takes 109 Felicitas to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Since the unit of measurement is not given, it leaves an uncertainty whether this number is in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. 5. Epoch date: The epoch date of December 31st, 2006 is mentioned, which represents a specific point in time used as a reference for calculating and describing the position and orbital elements of the celestial object. In the case of 109 Felicitas, this date is used as a reference for its orbital state at that particular time, and its current position and orbital elements can be computed based on the orbital data stated in the sentence. In summary, the extracted data from the sentence provides information about the periapsis, apoapsis, orbital period, and epoch date of a celestial object named 109 Felicitas. However, there is ambiguity regarding the units of measurement for the periapsis and orbital period in the given sentence. Still, this information helps to characterize the orbit and behavior of the celestial object."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On the night of 6 November 1995, a fire broke out in the Rova compound, destroying or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On the night of the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.The destruction of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred at a time when the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured motivations for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The body found in the public square on the night of the fire was later identified as belonging to Queen Ranavalona III. A funeral vigil was held the following day for the royal remains. The remains have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga, which is a hill and traditional fortified royal settlement situated near Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. Ambohimanga is considered a significant spiritual and cultural site in the country and is often the location where Malagasy royalty is laid to rest. The destruction of the Rova of Antananarivo was a significant event in Madagascar's history, and many suspicions and rumors still surround the cause of the fire. Despite the official investigation concluding that it was an accident, public speculation and mistrust has pointed towards various parties, including government officials, foreign powers, and other groups, potentially being responsible for the fire as an act of arson. This belief persists due to the potential motivations for arson at the Rova, including the destruction of important financial archives that could implicate corrupt government officials. In conclusion, the person whose body was found in the public square, identified as Queen Ranavalona III, has been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga, a significant cultural and spiritual site near the capital of Antananarivo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This distressing scene has been the reality at Japan's now-abandoned Inubosaki Marine Park Aquarium since January, sparking outrage from animal rights activists and concerned citizens around the globe. The Abandoned Aquarium and Its Remaining Inhabitants The Inubosaki Marine Park Aquarium, located in Choshi, fell on hard times as visitor numbers dwindled. In January, the owner abandoned the facility, leaving behind Honey the dolphin, 46 penguins, and hundreds of fish and reptiles. According to Reuters, a few staff members have been returning to the abandoned park to feed the remaining animals, but their future remains uncertain. Growing Concerns and Public Outcry Animal rights activists and concerned citizens have made the desperate situation at the aquarium known, with over 1,400 letters penned to the town of Choshi, voicing their worries and pleading for help. The head of aquarium issues at the Animal Rights Centre Japan spoke to the Guardian, expressing concern that \\"Honey will die if this situation continues.\\" They added that the dolphin has been \\"repeating the same movements ... and is showing definite signs of stress.\\" Similar concerns have been expressed about the penguins that remain in the abandoned enclosure. The dismal environment they are forced to live in raises questions about their physical and mental well-being. Authorities Assess the Situation Officials from the Chiba Prefecture's hygiene control division visited the aquarium to assess the animals' condition. Despite the appalling conditions, they found the animals to be healthy, with Honey recovering well from a sunburn (CNN). A representative from the Prefecture stated that the private owner, Inubosaki Marine Park, is working to find a new home for the animals. Future of Honey and Other Animals Animal Rights Centre Japan is pushing for Honey to be relocated to a sanctuary, given that releasing her back into her original home could lead to her recapture by hunters. Her home is off Taiji, a Pacific coast town infamous for its annual dolphin slaughter. Some local media outlets have reported that negotiations for the transfer of the abandoned aquarium's inhabitants have ended abruptly, but concerned activists are not relenting. One activist argued, \\"They have a responsibility to explain what they intend to do with Honey and the other animals.\\" In an effort to draw attention to the plight of these animals, people have taken to social media using the hashtag #SaveHoney. Conclusion The continued limbo in which Honey the dolphin and her fellow aquarium inhabitants find themselves has generated mounting outrage and concern among animal rights activists, citizens, and organizations. While the physical health of these animals may currently be stable, the heart-wrenching living conditions and uncertain future they face have created ripples of sympathy and concern around the world.

The movie, directed by Vincente Minnelli, was based on Irving Stone's 1934 biographical novel of the same name, which chronicled the life and career of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. Kirk Douglas starred as van Gogh, and the film explored their tumultuous friendship and their impact on each other's work. Anthony Quinn's portrayal of Paul Gauguin in the film was highly praised. Quinn captured the essence of Gauguin's character, showcasing his bohemian spirit, creativity, and often difficult personality that led to a strained relationship with van Gogh. These aspects of Gauguin's personality were visible in his famous works created during his time spent in Tahiti and the impact he left on the world of modern art. 'Lust for Life' received widespread acclaim for its honest and emotionally complex telling of the artists' lives, particularly that of van Gogh and his struggles with mental illness. Both Douglas and Quinn delivered remarkable performances in the film. Quinn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Paul Gauguin, while Douglas was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Vincent van Gogh.

How do you do this: To thin acrylic paints, you can","completion":"To thin acrylic paints, you can follow several methods and use various materials that are compatible with these versatile, water-based art supplies. Thinning acrylic paints allows for better flow, layering, and can also help to create the desired consistency for a specific technique. Here is a step-by-step guide on some of the most common methods you can use to thin acrylic paints effectively. Method 1: Using water 1. Gather your materials: You will need acrylic paint, a container with clean water, a mixing palette or dish, a brush or palette knife, and a dropper or pipette (optional). 2. Add a small amount of paint to your mixing palette or dish: Start with a small dollop of paint, remembering that you can always add more if needed. 3. Add water to the paint: Begin by adding a small amount of water to your paint. If you are using a dropper or pipette, start with just a few drops. 4. Mix the water and paint: Using your brush or palette knife, mix the water and paint together. Be thorough and consistent in your mixing to ensure a uniform consistency. 5. Assess the consistency: Examine the paint's consistency after mixing, adding more water if needed. Aim for a consistency similar to that of heavy cream. Thicker paint might require more water, while thinner paint will need less. 6. Test your paint: Test the thinned paint on a scrap piece of paper or canvas to ensure that it flows well and covers the surface evenly. Add additional water or paint to adjust the consistency as needed. 7. Paint your canvas: Once you are satisfied with the consistency, you can start applying the thinned paint to your canvas or project. Method 2: Using acrylic mediums 1. Choose an acrylic medium: Acrylic mediums are specially formulated products designed to work with acrylic paints, affecting their consistency, transparency, and drying time. Popular mediums for thinning paints include glazing medium, gloss medium, matte medium, and flow improver. 2. Combine paint and medium: Squeeze a small amount of paint onto your mixing palette or dish, then add an equal amount of your chosen medium. 3. Mix thoroughly: Using your brush or palette knife, mix the medium and paint together until they are well combined and the consistency is smooth. 4. Adjust consistency as needed: Add more medium to your paint mixture if you would like to thin it down further or increase transparency. For a thicker consistency, add more paint. 5. Test your paint: As with the water-thinning method, test the paint on a scrap piece of paper or canvas to ensure it has the desired consistency and appearance. 6. Paint your canvas: Once you are happy with the result, use the thinned paint for your project. Method 3: Using additives 1. Choose the appropriate additive: Certain additives can also be used to thin acrylic paints. Airbrush medium, for example, is designed specifically for spray application but can work for thinning regular acrylic paints as well. 2. Mix the paint and additive: In your mixing palette or dish, combine a small amount of paint with the additive, following the manufacturer's recommendations for proportions. 3. Blend well: Mix the paint and additive together thoroughly, ensuring an even consistency throughout. 4. Assess and adjust: Check the paint consistency on your palette or in your airbrush, adding more paint or additive as necessary to achieve the desired result. 5. Test the paint: Always test the paint on a scrap piece of material to ensure it has the desired consistency and appearance. 6. Apply the paint: Once satisfied, use the thinned paint for your project, either with a brush, palette knife, or airbrush. For the best results when thinning acrylic paints, always start with small amounts of water, medium, or additive, and mix well before adding more. Testing is crucial to achieving the ideal consistency, and be sure to remember that different acrylic paint brands and colors may respond differently to thinning, so tailor your approach accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: \\"Pushing Daisies\\" for sure is one of the best TV shows of its genre in the last 5 years, agree you with that or not. Bryan Fuller, the creator, has an amazing creative mind. He's the mind behind other great TV Shows as \\"Dead Like Me\\" (2003), \\"Wonderfalls\\" (2004), and the other one not as great as these ones, but also interesting, \\"Heroes\\" (2006). It's a mix of the marvelous worlds Brian Fuller created in previous TV shows, mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings, something that a fairytale always is. So, being a kind of fairytale, you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations, or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told. A gift always comes with a curse, and what is sweet can also be bitter. That's so, Ned (Lee Pace), The Piemaker, is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef: he can give life to the dead with just a touch. This could be a power that everybody would die - or live - for if wasn't for another simple and very sad thing: he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again. The curse of this amazing gift doesn't stops there... everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute, another specie of that one would die instantly. He's a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively, always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love. Till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love, Chuck (Anna Friel), if wasn't for another sad fact: she was dead. He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does, but this love is untouchable. The truly kiss of death. And that's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts. When I heard about \\"Pushing Daisies\\" for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar (or maybe some kind of tribute) to everything that Tim Burton has created since \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" (1985) to \\"Big Fish\\" (2003) and \\"Charlie And The Cholate Factory\\" (2005). The results could not be better. The world around The Pie Hole was magnificent. The stories around Ned and Detective Cod (Chi McBride) to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in TV, but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as Chuck and Olive (Kristin Chenoweth) in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors. Not only that, you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters, even those ones with the most deep dark humors. Forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes, the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things. The actors here are top of note. Lee Pace is tender, soft and contained as the character asks for. Anna Friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be. But the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as Chi McBride (Detective Emmerson Cod), Swoozie Kurtz (as Lilly Charles), Ellen Greene (as Vivian Charles) and Kristin Chenoweth (as Olive Snook). Swoozie Kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown, for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing. But if the best dialogs are given by Swoozie and her character, the best funny moments are given by Kristin Chenoweth. Seems that she's improvising all the time, she's so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside. Kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 Emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved. Also there's the chemistry between actors and their characters, that are also amazing. There are no words to express what this TV Show really is and what it was meant to be. For those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it, for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had: childhood. Truth be told... TV has never been so daring in a TV Show as with this amazing one. \\"Pushing Daisies\\" was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful. It's true that TV doesn't respect great TV shows as those ones Bryan Fuller created - except \\"Heroes\\" that's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is very positive. The person who wrote it really loves the TV show \\"Pushing Daisies\\" and thinks it's one of the best shows in its genre.

In 1887, eighteen years after the rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton was president of the new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice. Starting early in January, 1891, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Stone repeatedly at Pope's Hill, for the purpose of learning from Stone about the ways of political organizing. Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman's suffrage convention in October, 1889, and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying \\"Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet in this movement.\\" Stone mentored Catt the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fund-raising. Catt later used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920. Catt, Stone and Blackwell went together to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the \\"triumvirate\\" of women's suffrage, were called away from the convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen \\"I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in what we try to do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes...\\" Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as \\"Solitude of Self\\". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.

The original equation is: -24*r + 94*r = -78*r + 2072 Start with combining like terms on both sides of the equation. 1. Combine the terms on the right side: On the left side, you have -24*r and 94*r. When you add them together, you end up with 70*r (-24*r + 94*r = 70*r). 2. Combine the terms on the right side: On the right side, you only have one term involving r, which is -78*r. So the right side stays as it is ie. -78*r + 2072 So, the equation reduces to: 70*r = -78*r + 2072 Next, we attempt to isolate variable 'r'. 3. Add 78*r to both sides: In order to remove -78*r from the right side, we can add 78*r to both sides. On the left side, 70*r + 78*r gives you 148*r, and on the right side, -78*r + 78*r cancel out each other, leaving only 2072. So, we end up with a simplified equation: 148*r = 2072 To solve for 'r', divide both sides by 148. 4. Solve for 'r': To isolate 'r', divide both sides of the equation by 148 - r = 2072 / 148 The value of 'r' (rounded to two decimal places) is approximately 14.

Even with careful tuning, training may diverge or end up in a bad equilibrium with dropped modes. In this work, we introduce a new form of latent optimisation inspired by the CS-GAN and show that it improves adversarial dynamics by enhancing interactions between the discriminator and the generator. We develop supporting theoretical analysis from the perspectives of differentiable games and stochastic approximation. Our experiments demonstrate that latent optimisation can significantly improve GAN training, obtaining state-of-the-art performance for the ImageNet (128 x 128) dataset.

Movie title: Mommie Dearest Context: Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries to control the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.

It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of \\"Il trovatore\\". There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora. - Digipak is a patented style of optical disc packaging, and is a registered trademark of AGI-Shorewood, an Atlas Holdings LLC company.

The block is as massive as it is practical, because the higher the inertia of the anvil, the more efficiently it causes the energy of the striking tool to be transferred to the work piece. On a quality anvil the smith's hammer should rebound with almost as much energy as the smith puts into the downward stroke, ultimately making the smith's job easier and less physically strenuous. In most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool.

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Background Scenario: It is holiday season, and a group of friends or family members are gathering to spend time together and share a special meal. In this context, the main character, named Alex, has a close relationship with a person named Sarah. Sarah has recently shown interest in contributing to the holiday meal by preparing the turkey dinner, which she hasn't done before. The conversation that led to this statement was centered around the notion of Sarah's participation and support during the holiday gathering. Previous Conversation (Hypothetical): Alex: Hey, I was talking to Sarah earlier, and she mentioned that she'd like to help out for the holiday dinner. She said she was really looking forward to it and wants to make sure everything goes smoothly. Friend/Family Member 1: That's so nice of her! What do you think she could help with? I know we've got pretty much everything covered. Friend/Family Member 2: Maybe she could make the dessert or salad? That could help ease some of the workload that we already have. Alex: Actually, Sarah mentioned that she'd be willing to tackle preparing the turkey dinner. What do you think about that idea? I'm not sure if she has ever done it before, but she sounded excited to give it a try. Friend/Family Member 1: Well, I think that's a big responsibility. Cooking the turkey can be quite a challenge, especially for a first-timer. Are you sure she's up for it? Friend/Family Member 2: Yeah, but it could also be a good learning experience for her.

Friend/Family Member 3: I'm on board with it. Sometimes it's good to let others take charge and learn new skills. We just need to be there to encourage her and help if she needs it. Then comes the statement in question: Alex (responding to Friend/Family Member 3): Of course. I think she'd appreciate it. Imagine how you both feel if she fixed the turkey dinner or something. In summary, the conversation leading up to the statement was focused on the idea of allowing Sarah to participate in the holiday gathering by preparing the turkey dinner.

This episode of \\"Columbo\\" is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other \\"Columbo\\" episode, even though the series always used top directors. Spielberg manages to keep the great Falk and Cassidy from hamming it up too much, but both actors are still a lot of fun. Spielberg also gets fine supporting work from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All the performances have a freshness and vitality about them. The only \\"Columbo\\" episode that was close to being as well directed is the \\"By Dawn's Early Light\\" episode with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). I think the two episodes of \\"The Psychiatrist\\" and this episode of \\"Columbo\\" suggest Spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director. He was great from the beginning. In a \\"Combat!\\" DVD commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring Albert Salmi, Robert Altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director. Maybe the same is true of Spielberg. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Choices: (a). negative. (b). positive.","completion":"(b). positive. The review is indeed positive. The reviewer strongly praises Steven Spielberg's work on both \\"The Psychiatrist\\" and \\"Columbo\\". They note the stylistic visual elements, emotional complexity, and standout performances that Spielberg was able to draw out and capture in his episodes, crediting him with a high level of technical skill in his directorial role. The review also highlights the fact that these achievements were made despite less-than-ideal budget circumstances. Furthermore, it recognizes the continuity of Spielberg's quality work, suggesting that his great directorial talent was evident from early in his career. Thus, the reviewer clearly expresses positive sentiments regarding Spielberg's directorial abilities and his work on the mentioned episodes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: In April 2012, a Kansas SWAT team raided the home of Robert and Addie Harte, their 7-year-old daughter and their 13-year-old son. The couple, both former CIA analysts, awoke to pounding at the door. When Robert Harte answered, SWAT agents flooded the home. He was told to lie on the floor. When Addie Harte came out to see what was going on, she saw her husband on his stomach as SWAT cop stood over him with a gun. The family was then held at gunpoint for more than two hours while the police searched their home. Though they claimed to be looking for evidence of a major marijuana growing operation, they later stated that they knew within about 20 minutes that they wouldn’t find any such operation. So they switched to search for evidence of “personal use.” They found no evidence of any criminal activity. The investigation leading to the raid began at least seven months earlier, when Robert Harte and his son went to a gardening store to purchase supplies to grow hydroponic tomatoes for a school project. A state trooper had been positioned in the store parking lot to collect the license plate numbers of customers, compile them into a spreadsheet, then send the spreadsheets to local sheriff’s departments for further investigation. Yes, merely shopping at a gardening store could make you the target of a criminal drug investigation. More than half a year later, the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department began investigating the Hartes as part of “Operation Constant Gardener,” basically a PR stunt in which the agency conducts multiple pot raids on April 20, or “4/20.” On several occasions, the Sheriff’s Department sent deputies out to sort through the family’s garbage. (The police don’t need a warrant to sift through your trash.) The deputies repeatedly found “saturated plant material” that they thought could possibly be marijuana. On two occasions, a drug testing field kit inexplicably indicated the presence of THC, the active drug in marijuana. It was on the basis of those tests and Harte’s patronage of a gardening store that the police obtained the warrant for the SWAT raid. [Meet Jay Via: One bad cop, in one county, who did a whole lot of damage] But, of course, they found nothing. Lab tests would later reveal that the “saturated plant material” was actually loose-leaf tea, which Addie Harte drinks on a regular basis. Why did the field tests come up positive for pot? As I wrote back in February, it’s almost as if these tests come up positive whenever the police need them to. A partial list of substances that the tests have mistaken for illegal drugs would include sage, chocolate chip cookies, motor oil, spearmint, soap, tortilla dough, deodorant, billiard’s chalk, patchouli, flour, eucalyptus, breath mints, Jolly Ranchers and vitamins. Back in 2009, the Marijuana Policy Project demonstrated how easily the tests could be manipulated to generate positive results : As a lab-coated and rubber glove wearing researcher from the South Carolina Center for Biotechnology dumped a sample of oregano into a field test kit, Mintwood Media’s Adam Eidinger produced a positive test result for cocaine with another kit simply by exposing it to the atmosphere. “This is just air,” Eidinger said, opening up a test and waving it as the reagent turned orange, indicating a positive result. This 2009 video, sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, demonstrates how tests for illegal drugs could potentially be manipulated to generate false results. (Marijuana Policy Project and Mintwood Media Collective) The testing done at the press conference replicated that done earlier by the researchers, who found that a surprisingly large number of common substances generated false positive results for the presence of drugs. “While testing the specificity of the KN Reagent test kits with 42 non-marijuana substances, I observed that 70% of these tests rendered a false positive,” said Dr. Omar Bagasra, director of the Center for Biotechnology, who conducted the experiments. That research came as part of new report, False Positives Equal False Justice, by forensics expert John Kelly in collaboration with former FBI chief scientist and narcotics officer Dr. Frederick Whitehurst. In the report, the pair uncovered “a drug testing regime of fraudulent forensics used by police, prosecutors, and judges which abrogates every American’s constitutional rights,” as Kelly wrote in the executive summary. “Law enforcement officials, forensic drug analysts, and prosecutors knowingly employ the flawed Duquenois-Levine and KN Reagent tests as well as mere conclusory police reports to wrongfully prosecute and convict millions of individuals for anti-marijuana law violations,” Kelly wrote. This is the same brand of test kit used in the Harte case. Despite the fact that the sheriff’s department didn’t begin investigating the Hartes until at least seven months after their allegedly suspicious activity (again — shopping at a gardening store) first attracted the notice of police, the sheriff’s department couldn’t wait for the more accurate laboratory tests to confirm that the “saturated plant material” was marijuana before sending a SWAT team into the Harte home. Doing so would have jeopardized the news hook of tying the raids to 4/20. It took all of 10 days to complete those lab tests. The lab not only concluded that substance wasn’t pot, the analysts added, “It does not look anything like marijuana leaves or stems.” At the conclusion of the raids, the Sheriff’s Department held a press conference to tout their success. News reports emphasized that the raids had turned up drug activity “in good neighborhoods” in places like Leawood (where the Hartes live), and at the homes of “average Johnson County families.” [In the end, 2015 saw no “war on cops\\" and no “national crime wave\\"] Once they had been cleared of any wrongdoing, the Hartes wanted to know what happened. Why had they been raided? What possible probable cause could the police have had for sending a SWAT team into their home first thing in the morning? But even that information would prove difficult to obtain. Under Kansas law, the sheriff’s department wasn’t obligated to turn over any information related to the raid — not to the Hartes, not to the media, not to anyone. The couple eventually had to hire an attorney to get a judge to order the sheriff to release the information. They spent more than 25,000 in legal fees just to learn why the sheriff had sent a SWAT team into their home. Once they finally had that information, the Hartes filed a lawsuit. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge John W. Lungstrum dismissed every one of the Hartes’s claims. Lungstrum found that sending a SWAT team into a home first thing in the morning based on no more than a positive field test and spotting a suspect at a gardening store was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. He found that the police had probable cause for the search, and that the way the search was conducted did not constitute excessive force. He found that the Hartes had not been defamed by the raid or by the publicity surrounding it. He also ruled that the police were under no obligation to know that drug testing field kits are inaccurate, nor were they obligated to wait for the more accurate lab tests before conducting the SWAT raid. The only way they’d have a claim would be if they could show that the police lied about the results, deliberately manipulated the tests or showed a reckless disregard for the truth — and he ruled that the Hartes had failed to do so. Keep in mind that this was a ruling for summary judgment. This was not a trial. To dismiss the suit at this stage, Lungstrum needed to view the facts in a light most favorable to the Hartes. And yet he still found that at no point did the police violate the family’s constitutional rights. The Hartes’s fight wasn’t completely in vain. The couple also made a political push to change Kansas law when it comes to police records and transparency. In May, the legislature passed a modest reform bill. Here’s what I wrote about the bill at the time: But while the bill is a step in the right direction, it’s far from a resounding victory for transparency, and it leaves Kansas well behind the rest of the country on this issue. Whereas the current law seals all search warrant affidavits by default, the bill would codify the presumption that the records will be made available to the owner of the premises that was searched. But there are a couple catches. Prosecutors can file a motion within five days of the search to keep the records sealed. There’s a justifiable reason for that — some searches may be part of an ongoing investigation, the details of which could be revealed in the affidavit for the warrant. The problem, of course, is that a prosecutor could just as easily file for a seal to protect himself, his office or the police officers involved from embarrassment. The onus would then be on the wrongly searched to hire an attorney to fight the seal. The far more problematic part of the law is that, while it removes the presumption that all documents related to a fruitless search should be sealed, it unseals them only for the owners of the premises that was searched. These records will still be kept sealed from the public. (It seems clear from the law that the owners could then make the documents public themselves.) That provision makes it extremely difficult for, say, a media outlet to do a broad survey of how searches are conducted by a particular police agency. (Like this, for example.) To do such a survey or investigation, a journalist would need to get permission from all of the people whose homes or businesses were searched, turning up no evidence of criminality. Without access to the documents, though, there is no way to know who those people are — or if they even exist. It makes it impossible to know if there is a problem, and impossible to identify the extent of the problem if one exists. It would be up to the people wrongly searched to come forward on their own. I was in Kansas a few months ago and spoke to a number of people who were subjected to extraordinarily violent home raids and searches. They were terrified of going public. They talked to me only because I have written on these issues in the past and felt comfortable that I wouldn’t reveal their names. An earlier, more robust reform bill initially passed the Kansas house 113-10 but was then gutted by the state’s Senate after heavy lobbying from prosecutors. During the debate over an earlier version of the bill, opponents made it clear that media scrutiny is precisely what they feared. The bill drew a sharp reaction from law enforcement circles. Prosecutors contended the bill would provide gritty details about criminal cases that the media would sensationalize. Riley County Attorney Barry Wilkerson said the bill does more more to help the media than to help individuals. “It’s not going to be the public that’s going to rush to the courthouse to get an affidavit. It’s going to be the media” . . . And, of course, we can’t have the media looking into critical public safety initiatives like “Operation Constant Gardener.” If such scrutiny revealed that cops consider merely shopping at a garden supply store to be suspicious behavior, that drug testing field kits are more about circumventing the Fourth Amendment than accurate results or that a sheriff’s boast of having shut down a drug operation run by an “average family” in a “good neighborhood” was actually a terrifying raid in which SWAT cops held two kids at gunpoint because their mother enjoyed drinking tea … well, some people might begin to question the wisdom of the drug war. [The age of “pre-crime\\" has arrived] The Hartes are also a white, financially sound couple who both happened to have worked for the CIA. Most people on the receiving end of these raids aren’t white, aren’t middle-class, didn’t once work for a federal intelligence agency and don’t have 25,000 to fund a fight in court. If even those advantages can’t help the Hartes win some accountability, you can imagine the long odds faced by the typical victim of a botched raid. The Hartes’s attorney recently told KMBC that they will likely appeal Lungstrum’s decision.

How to buy a strawberry plant Purchase june-bearing varieties for the largest strawberries. June-bearing strawberry plants are the most common varieties because they bear large, healthy fruit over a period of two to three weeks. Typically, june-bearing strawberries produce one crop per season.","completion":"Step 1: Research suitable june-bearing strawberry varieties Before purchasing a strawberry plant, it's important to research the different june-bearing varieties available. Consider factors such as taste, size, and disease resistance. Gather information from gardening websites, books, and local nurseries. Step 2: Determine the ideal planting location Choose a location in your garden or yard where the strawberry plant will receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Ensure that the soil is well-draining and has a pH of 5.8 to 6.5 for optimal growth. Step 3: Visit a local nursery or garden center Visit a nearby nursery or garden center that sells june-bearing strawberry plants. Expert staff can help you select the best variety for your region and provide advice on how to grow and care for the plant. Step 4: Purchase the strawberry plant Once you have determined the ideal june-bearing strawberry variety and planting location, purchase the plant along with any necessary supplies such as soil, fertilizer, and mulch. Step 5: Prepare the planting area Prepare the location you've chosen for your strawberry plant by loosening the soil and adding compost or organic matter to improve drainage and fertility. Step 6: Plant the strawberry plant Dig a hole deep enough to accommodate the roots of the strawberry plant without bending or crowding them. Set the plant into the hole and gently spread out the roots before covering them with soil and lightly firming it around the plant base. Step 7: Water and care for the plant Thoroughly water the newly planted strawberry plant, making sure the soil is moist but not soggy. Throughout the growing season, maintain consistent moisture levels and provide fertilizer according to the recommendations for the specific strawberry variety. Step 8: Monitor growth and production Monitor the strawberry plant's progress throughout the growing season. June-bearing varieties typically produce fruit 4-6 weeks after planting, so watch for blooms and fruit development. Step 9: Harvest the strawberries When the strawberries have ripened (usually when they turn a deep red color), harvest them by gently twisting or pinching them off the plant. Step 10: Enjoy your strawberries After harvesting, enjoy your homegrown strawberries in your favorite recipes or eat them fresh for a delicious and healthy treat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What lies ahead for General Relativity now that LIGO has detected gravitational waves? Options are: I. no. II. yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To figure out if the answers to these two questions would be the same, I will first analyze each question separately: Question 1: This question asks whether General Relativity could still be replaced or improved upon in the future, despite the detection of gravitational waves. It is asking about the possibility of new theories or improvements, not the validity of the current. Question 2: This question is inquiring about the future prospects or path of General Relativity now that gravitational waves have been detected by LIGO. In essence, it is wanting to know what new developments or directions might come about from this discovery. So, breaking them down: Question 1 is about the possibility to find a new or improved theory that might replace or supersede General Relativity. This would answer \\"YES\\" or \\"NO\\" based on the current state of scientific knowledge and research. Question 2 is about the future prospects of General Relativity considering the fact that gravitational waves have already been detected. These prospects could range from further strengthening of the theory, to the potential for new discoveries that could lead to modifications or expansions of the theory. So, while they both concern General Relativity and gravity waves, the nature of the questions are inherently different. The first is about the potential for new theories or improvements, and the second is about the future development and impact of the current theory. Therefore, the answer to either question could in theory be YES or NO, but the reason for each answer wouldn't necessarily be the same.

After he returned home, he proudly gave it to his mother, saying \\"My teacher let me give this letter to you.\\" Not knowing what it was, Edison's mother opened it, and then her eyes opened wide. With tears in her eyes, she looked at her son and read out the letter aloud, \\"Your child is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn't have enough good teachers to train him. Please teach him yourself.\\" The fact was that Edison liked asking strange questions in class. His teachers thought he was mentally ill. They could no longer stand him and decided to stop him from going to school. However, Edison's mother didn't give up on her son. She taught him at home. Many years after Edison's mother died and he was already one of the greatest inventors, one day he was looking through the old family things.

He had, of course, brought his papers with him; so that he had no difficulty, whatever, in getting on by the train. But the train itself made but slow work of it. Bourbaki had passed west only the week before, with all his army, upon his march to the relief of Belfort; and the railway was completely choked. However, Ralph was not inclined to grumble at the cause of his delay; for it was only upon Bourbaki's approach that the Germans had evacuated Dijon--which was now held by Garibaldi's irregulars, and a considerable force of Mobiles.

The study examined hotel housekeepers over a period of four weeks. Some of the housekeepers were told that their work duties gave them enough activity to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines . Another group of housekeepers were told nothing. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work activity counted as exercise lost weight and body fat, and their blood pressure went down. The results of this study suggest that it's important to understand and believe in the positive benefits of your activity. So here are a few things to think about the next time you exercise: Just thirty minutes of quick walking each day can greatly reduce your risk of a heart attack. Even your housework -- like yard work and house cleaning -- can help you burn calories and increase your fitness levels. Weight bearing activity just a few times a week can build bone density and reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis . Three 10-minute workouts throughout the day are just as good to your health as one long workout. Moderate amounts of exercise have been linked to lower rates of heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Strength training can help make daily activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier. Regular exercise will reduce stress, keep you in a good mood and improve the quality of your sleep.

The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease.

What's the best answer to this question: do i need a tourist visa for taiwan? pick from the following. 1). no 2). yes...A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Do I need a tourist visa for Taiwan?\\" depends on your nationality, the duration of your stay, and the purpose of your visit. Here's a detailed explanation: 1) Nationals of visa-exempt countries: If you are a citizen of one of the visa-exempt countries, which include the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, among others, you generally do not need a tourist visa for short stays (up to 90 days for most countries). However, you must have a valid passport for at least 6 months (3 months for Japanese citizens and the duration of stay for U.S. citizens). Please note that for certain countries, the visa exemption duration may differ. For instance, citizens of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are granted visa-free access for up to 180 days. 2) Nationals eligible for visa on arrival: Citizens of certain countries, such as Turkey and India, can apply for a visa on arrival at select airports and seaports in Taiwan. The eligibility for a visa on arrival depends on whether the visitor holds a valid residence, work, or student visa for the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Schengen Agreement countries, or Japan. In this case, the visitor must have a confirmed onward ticket and pay a fee in cash (NTD 2,400 for adults and NTD 1,200 for minors). The visa on arrival is generally valid for 30 days and cannot be renewed or extended. 3) Nationals requiring a tourist visa in advance: If you are not from a visa-exempt country or not eligible for visa on arrival, you must apply for a tourist visa at a Taiwanese consulate or embassy before traveling to Taiwan. In this case, the necessary documents, processing times, and fees may vary depending on your country. To determine the most appropriate answer for your specific situation, you should refer to the Taiwan visa policy and check the visa requirements based on your nationality. In conclusion, the best answer for you might be: 1) No, if you are from a visa-exempt country and staying for a short duration. 2) Yes, if you are required to obtain a tourist visa for Taiwan in advance or if you are eligible for a visa on arrival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself .

Millions of dollars have been used to help stop the spill and to clean up the animals, beaches, and land spoiled by the oil. Unfortunately, when many of these chemicals are used, more damage is caused to the environment, especially to lives in the sea. But governments seem to accept the _ of transporting mil-lions of tons of oil by ship every day so that we can fill up our cars and drive around and cause even more environmental damage. Interestingly, the biggest companies in the world produce cars, and the next biggest supply the gasoline to make them run. Of all of today's environmental disasters, an oil spill may actually be one of the least serious. Although oil is poisonous, it is a natural material. In the end, it breaks down naturally. In 1967 the tanker Torrey Canyon sank off the Scilly Isles near the coast of England and spilled 120,000 tons of oil into the ocean. If you go there today, you will find it hard to see any sign that it ever happened. However, we should be thinking more about reducing our dependency on oil. Governments should be encouraging research into new technologies, such as cars run by solar power, electricity, hydro-gen, and so on. Much of this research, in the past, was stopped by the oil, gas, and coal. If the world's millions of cars were 10% more efficient ,we would need many fewer tankers crossing the oceans each year. If this happened, the risks of oil spills would be reduced, and the air we breathe would be cleaner and fresher, too. Question: What is the passage mainly talking about?

A 'lost' painting sold last year for £3,500 as the work of a John Constable copycat has been snapped up for a whopping £3.5million after it was revealed to be painted by the celebrated artist himself. Renowned auctioneers Christie's of London thought a fan had painted the study of Salisbury Cathedral in homage to Constable's famous 1831 work, and so valued it at just £500. A collector snapped it up for £3,500 in June 2013 but after taking a closer look they suspected the original artwork had been painted over. London auctioneers Christie's thought a fan had painted the study of Salisbury Cathedral (pictured) in homage to British artist John Constable's famous 1831 work. Christie's sold it for £3,500, but the painting was found to be an original work after the buyer realised it had been painted over. Restorers were called in to remove the added brushstrokes, and to the new owner's delight the oil painting was confirmed by scholars to be an original work by the Haywain artist himself. Experts say the previously unknown painting is one of several preparatory sketches Constable did before creating the masterpiece 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows', which was bought by the Tate gallery last year for £23.1million. After being catalogued by one of the world's leading authorities on Constable, the painting was relisted with auctioneers Sotheby's with an estimate of £2million, 4,000 times the original estimate. But after an intense bidding war the painting was sold to an unnamed bidder who forked out a staggering 5million - around £3.5million - including the auction house's fees. A spokesman for Sotheby's said: 'It is a wonderful result.' Prior to its sale in 2013 the 18in by 24in painting had been in a collection amassed in the 19th Century by William Henry Smith, founder of the high street stationary chain. It hung on the walls of Hambleden Manor in the Chilterns, home to his descendants the Viscounts Hambleden, until the Elizabethan property was sold in 2007. Lady Hambleden, 83, sold off the contents of the house - including the Constable painting - in the Christie's auction which raised £1.17m. The 'lost' artwork of Salisbury Cathedral was found to be an original sketching by British artist John Constable (depicted in this painting right). The painting was owned by Lady Hambleden (left) until she decided to sell it via Christie's of London because she 'longer had room for it' Experts said the painting is one of several preparatory sketches Constable did before creating the masterpiece 'Salisbury Cathedral From The Meadows' (above), which was bought for £23.1million last year. But specialists apparently failed to spot that the painting of Salisbury Cathedral was an original, instead listing it as being painted by 'a follower of Constable'. It was valued at £500 to £800 and sold for £3,500 to the lucky, anonymous buyer who then realised the painting had been heavily retouched in what experts say was a 'misguided attempt' to 'finish' it. Industry specialists say Lady Hambledon will have a case to sue Christie's if it can be proven the auctioneers did not carry out due diligence when checking the work. Prior to the auction Anne Lyles, a leading authority on the artist and former curator at the Tate, said Constable paintings could be tricky to attribute to the artist but she stood by her view that it was an original. She said: 'The buyer in 2013 will have taken an well-informed punt on this painting, which had a very low estimate, and then got it cleaned. 'Not everyone who takes a punt is going to get it right but on this occasion they did.' The depiction of Salisbury Cathedral (pictured) was sold by Christie's on behalf of Lady Hambleden. The famous newsagents firm was founded in 1792 when the first news vendors was opened in Little Grosvenor Street, London. It was handed down through the family until 1948 when the third Viscount Hambleden died. As Viscount Hambleden owned all the ordinary shares and the death duties were so heavy, a public holding company was formed to buy up all the share capital of WHSmith & Son Limited. The shares of the holding company were subscribed by the family, staff and public and on September 1, 1949, WHSmith & Son (Holdings) Limited was formed. Its governing director, and later its first chairman, was the Hon. David Smith - brother of the third Viscount Hambleden. However, the Smith family's control later slipped away, and the last family member left the board in 1996. Although no family member now sits on the board of the high street stationers, the Smiths collectively own £23million of company stock. Lady Hambleden, born Countess Maria Carmela Attolico di Adelfia, moved into Hambleden Manor when she married William Herbert Smith - the fourth Viscount Hambleden - in 1955. Lord Hambleden, who liked to be known as Harry, was the great-grandson of William Henry Smith, the founder of W H Smith. Lord and Lady Hambleden divorced in 1988 but she remained in the manor - in the heart of the Chilterns - while her ex-husband moved to America, where he died last August, aged 82. In 2013, she decided to sell off a number of artworks at the Elizabethan property because she now lives in a cottage in the village and 'no longer has room for them'. Ivan Macquisten, the editor of the Antiques Trade Gazette, added: 'I would be surprised if the previous vendor was not considering taking the matter further.' Before the auction a spokesman for Christie's said: 'We are aware that Sotheby's are offering this work as by Constable. 'We took the view at the time of our sale in 2013 that it was by a \\"follower of\\". We understand that there is no clear consensus of expertise on the new attribution.'

Goal: Pose for camera with great smile. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To best accomplish the goal of posing for a camera with a great smile, it is important to consider various techniques and methods that can help enhance your appearance and convey positive emotions. Since you did not provide specific options to choose from, I will provide a comprehensive guide on how to achieve an appealing and genuine smile for the camera. 1. Mentally prepare: Before posing for the camera, make sure your thoughts are focused on positivity, happiness, or anything that makes you feel good. This will help bring out a natural, authentic smile. 2. Practice your smile: Stand in front of a mirror and practice your smile. Make a mental note of how it feels when you create a smile that feels natural and flattering. You can try various smile types, such as a full grin, a subtle smile, or a toothy smile, to see which one works best for you. This practice will allow you to easily replicate your best smile when it's time to pose for the camera. 3. Relax your face muscles: Before smiling, take a deep breath and relax your facial muscles. This will help release any tension and result in a more genuine smile. 4. Use your eyes: A great smile involves not just the mouth, but also your eyes. When you smile, your eyes should naturally wrinkle slightly at the corners. Squinting your eyes ever so lightly can help create this effect. You can also think of a happy memory to help evoke natural eye engagement. 5. Maintain good posture: A good posture can make a significant difference in the overall quality of your pose. Stand or sit up straight with your shoulders back, chin slightly raised, and head held high. This will give a sense of confidence and openness to your appearance. 6. Angle your body: Instead of facing the camera directly, try angling your body slightly. This creates a more dynamic and photogenic pose. You can also turn your head slightly, which will add some depth and dimension to the photo. 7. Experiment with different tilts and angles: Try slightly tilting your head or angling it to one side to see what looks best on you. Different head angles can convey various emotions and add character to the shot. 8. Play with hair and accessories: If you have long hair, you can toss it or run your fingers through it to create a candid and dynamic shot. Use accessories like hats, sunglasses, or props to add interest and depth to your image. 9. Show your personality: Let your true self shine through your facial expression and body language. Reflect your unique energy, confidence, and style in your pose, and your smile is more likely to appear genuine. 10. Have fun: Embrace the moment and enjoy your time in front of the camera. When you're having fun and feeling relaxed, a great smile is more likely to emerge naturally. In summary, the most reasonable approach to achieving a great smile when posing for a camera includes mental preparation, practice, engaging your eyes, maintaining good posture, angling your body, experimenting with different head tilts, playing with hair and accessories, showing your personality, and enjoying the moment. This combination of techniques will not only result in a captivating smile but also create a memorable and aesthetic photograph."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.

Finding Galina doesn't take long, and Jacques must wrap up the mission by returning Galina and the contraband to his superiors by train. Jacques's physician wife Madeline (Susan Gibney) isn't happy about this turn of events, no doubt having invested a small fortune in a Berlitz correspondence course and a year of acting lessons for Jacques's birthday. But she sees him off at the train station with the couple's teenaged daughter Bailey Kristoff (Jessica Bowman) and son Ethan Kristoff (Kristopher Van Varenberg). It seems Galina's ill-gotten gain is three vials of SP-43, an ultra-virulent strain of smallpox, cultured in fluorescent green serum. It also seems that a group of terrorists, led by Mason Cole (Tomas Arana), intend to hijack the train and steal the virus for their own ends. But standing in their way is Jacques. The virus ends up getting loose in the train's ventilation system. Unfortunately, Jacques's family picked this special moment to surprise him for his birthday by tagging along for the ride.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Limp Bizkit is an American rap rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed in 1994. Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band's elaborate live shows. Borland is known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a \\"burnt match\\". Describing the character, he stated, \\"I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black--from the neck up--and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.\\" Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5. In addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan \\"Primus sucks\\": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, \\"they finger us back--and you know what that means to us--that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'\\" During the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a 30-foot toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by \\"flushing\\" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls. During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the Los Angeles Times described as \\"a mix of The War Of The Worlds and Mars Attacks\\". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances. During the band's Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career. Do they use costumes often?","completion":"Yes, Limp Bizkit, especially Wes Borland, is known for using costumes and body paint during their concerts.

A 'super' strain of untreatable gonorrhea is sweeping developed countries across the world including Britain and Northern Ireland. The sexually transmitted disease, which infects millions of people every year, is becoming resistant to all antibiotics, according to the World Health Organisation. The U.N. health agency is urging governments and doctors to step up surveillance of the STD, the second most common after chlamydia. Dangerous mutations: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes Gonorrhea, is developing new strands resistant to every treatment. Gonorrhea can cause inflammation, infertility, pregnancy complications and, in extreme cases, lead to maternal death. Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea have a 50 per cent chance of developing eye infections that can result in blindness. 'This organism has basically been. developing resistance against every medication we've thrown at it,' said. Dr Manjula Lusti-Narasimhan, a scientist in WHO's department of STDs. This includes a group of antibiotics called cephalosporins currently considered the last line of treatment. Resistance to cephalosporins was first. reported in Japan, but more recently has also been detected in Britain,. Australia, France, Sweden and Norway. As these are all countries with. well-developed health systems, it is likely that cephalosporin-resistant. strains are also circulating undetected elsewhere. More than 17,000 new cases of gonorrhea were reported in the UK in 2009. Young men and women are affected most – the highest rates of gonorrhea are seen in women aged 16-19 and men aged 20-24. 'I. think this is probably only the tip of the iceberg,' said Professor. Catherine Ison, who oversees the national surveillance program for. treatment of resistant gonorrhea in England and Wales. Clap: Disease used to be rife among sailors, soldiers and prostitutes as this American sexual hygiene poster warns. Doctors have blamed overuse or misuse of antibiotics for the disease moving towards becoming a superbug, coupled with the bacteria's astonishing ability to adapt. Professor Ison said doctors in Britain are now switching to. using a combination of antibiotics over a longer period of time to. combat resistant gonorrhea. Dr Lusti-Narasimhan said that better sex education was needed,. as proper condom use is an effective means of stopping transmission. 'We're not going to be able to get rid of it completely,' she said in an interview ahead of WHO's public announcement on its 'global action plan' to combat the disease. 'But we can limit the spread. Concern: The STD is the second most common in the UK and affects more than 17,000 people a year (posed by model) 'In a couple of years it will have become resistant to every treatment option we have available now.' Dr Lusti-Narasimhan said the new guidance is aimed at ending complacency about gonorrhea and encouraging researchers to speed up their hunt for a new cure. Once considered a scourge of sailors and soldiers, gonorrhea - known colloquially as the clap - became easily treatable with the discovery of penicillin. Now, the global health body estimates that gonorrhea is responsible for 106million infections annually. It also increases the chances of infection with other diseases, such as HIV. 'It's not a European problem or an African problem, it's really a worldwide problem,' said Dr Lusti-Narasimhan. These bacteria survive antibiotic treatment due to a mutation that makes them resistant, then quickly spread their genes in an accelerated process of natural selection. This is a general problem affecting all antibiotics, but gonorrhea is particularly quick to adapt because it is good at picking up snippets of DNA from other bacteria, said Dr Lusti-Narasimhan. 'If it didn't do so much damage it would actually be a fun organism to study,' she said. The over-the-counter availability of low potency antibiotics in some Asian countries is another reason resistance is increasing, she said. The Geneva-based WHO wants countries not just to tighten their rules for antibiotic use but also to improve their surveillance systems so that the full extent of the problem can be determined.","completion":"A \\"super\\" strain of untreatable gonorrhea is spreading throughout developed countries, including the UK and Northern Ireland.

Article: The first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880. By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500 km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long-distance services from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, and the Berlin-Munich route will continue via the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. Only the segment west of Erfurt of the Frankfurt-Dresden line will continue to be used by ICE trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200 km/h (currently 160 km/h). Erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines. The most important regional railway lines in Thuringia are the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to Würzburg and Meiningen, the Weimar–Gera railway from Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway from Erfurt to Magdeburg, the Gotha–Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to Göttingen, the Halle–Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the Leipzig–Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof. Most regional and local lines have hourly service, but some run only every other hour. Question: When will the new high speed train be open?","completion":"The new high speed train line in Thuringia was planned to be opened in 2017, as per the information in the given passage. This new line was anticipated to divert long-distance services away from the mid-19th century lines, providing a more efficient route for the InterCity Express (ICE) services. With this infrastructure, the ICE services from Dresden to Frankfurt and from Berlin to Munich were expected to follow the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway route. Moreover, the Berlin-Munich route was also planned to continue via the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. The novel high-speed line was part of a larger scheme to update and improve the railway network in Thuringia, which also included refurbishing the main railway lines since 1990 to enhance travel speeds, along with the complete reconstruction of Erfurt's central station in the 2000s to serve as the new connection node for both ICE lines. These developments aimed to enhance connectivity, speed, and efficiency for both regional and long-distance train services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: When not playing your mandolin, where would you store it? - closet - musical instrument store - instrument case - music shop - music store The best answer is Answer:","completion":"When not playing your mandolin, the ideal place to store it is in an instrument case specifically designed for mandolins. This ensures you are providing the best protection and security for your instrument. Here's a detailed explanation of the best answer: An instrument case designed for mandolins is the optimal storage solution for several reasons: 1. Protection: A mandolin case is made from durable and high-quality materials designed to protect the instrument from damage. This includes hard, shock-resistant exteriors and soft, padded interiors that prevent scratches, dents, or any form of damage that may result from accidents, dropping, or environmental factors. 2. Controlled environment: A good-quality case provides a stable environment that safeguards the instrument from humidity and temperature changes. Excessive humidity or exposure to extreme temperatures can damage the wood, glue, or finishes of the instrument, affecting its lifespan and playability. 3. Portability: An instrument case is designed to be portable and easy to carry, with handles, straps, or even wheels for larger cases. This makes it convenient for traveling to and from lessons, rehearsals, performances, or even across long distances. 4. Organization and storage: Mandolin cases often include compartments for organizing accessories such as strings, picks, straps, and sheet music. This ensures that all your essentials are in one place and easily accessible when needed. While the other options mentioned can serve as temporary storage solutions, they do not provide the same level of protection and care that a dedicated instrument case for your mandolin offers. - Closet: Storing your mandolin in a closet might be a suitable short-term solution, but it may not provide the necessary protection against damage, especially if the closet is prone to dramatic temperature or humidity changes. Additionally, accidental falls or bumps could easily occur, leading to damage. - Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store: These options imply leaving your mandolin at a commercial establishment when not in use. This is not a practical or cost-effective solution, considering the ongoing fees and lack of accessibility to your instrument. Also, retaining responsibility for your instrument's care is essential, and relying on a third-party storage facility does not guarantee proper handling and maintenance. In summary, a mandolin-specific instrument case is the best answer to safeguard your valuable mandolin when not in use. This option provides the necessary protection, controlled environment, portability, and organization that are essential for maintaining the instrument's longevity and playability."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: what year was mario popular I found the following answer on Google: This is a list of video games where the character Mario plays a part, either as the protagonist , antagonist , supporting character , as part of an ensemble cast , as a cameo , or in a game within a game.

Given the question \\"Why did Jordan do this?\\", is \\"be polite\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"be polite\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Jordan do this?\\" However, it's important to provide a more detailed and in-depth response to fully address the various aspects of the situation and the possible underlying reasons for Jordan's actions. Jordan's decision to hold the door open and let his friends come into his house can be attributed to multiple factors. While politeness is one of the primary reasons, there may be other factors at play as well. Here's a more comprehensive and holistic explanation: 1. Politeness and Etiquette: As mentioned in the given answer, Jordan's action of holding the door can be interpreted as an act of politeness and good manners. In many cultures, holding the door open for others is a sign of respect and consideration. By doing this, Jordan is showing that he values his friends and wants to make them feel welcome and appreciated. 2. Social Norms: Jordan might have held open the door as a way of following social norms and expectations. Society often dictates that one should be hospitable and courteous to guests, which includes actions like holding open the door. By following these norms, Jordan is showcasing his adherence to the unspoken rules that govern social behavior. 3. Proactive Hosting: Holding the door open could also be interpreted as an act of proactive hosting. As a host, Jordan wants to ensure that his friends have a pleasant experience at his house. By holding the door and letting them enter with ease, Jordan is demonstrating his attentiveness to their needs and making an effort to facilitate a smooth transition into his home. 4. Safety and Security: Another reason for holding the door open could be related to safety and security. By personally opening the door for his friends, Jordan is not only able to greet them warmly, but he can also ensure that only invited guests are entering his house. This adds an extra layer of security and assurance for both Jordan and his friends. 5. Nonverbal Communication: Lastly, Jordan's act of holding the door open might serve as a form of nonverbal communication. By doing this, Jordan is conveying a message of warmth, hospitality, and openness to his friends, even without using words. This gesture helps set the atmosphere for the gathering and fosters a sense of camaraderie among the group. In conclusion, while \\"be polite\\" is indeed a valid answer to explain Jordan's actions, it's important to consider the various factors that could have influenced his decision. By taking into account politeness, social norms, proactive hosting, safety, and nonverbal communication, we can provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the situation."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Every day revolved around alcohol on some form or fashion. It literally was like the movie Animal House Now these 2 friends (let's call them Bill and Ted) were a little dorky compared to the rest of the other guys. We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys. Long story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen. Ted married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be. Other than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\", answer the following question.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. I am facing a new situation today: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? A:","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be inferred that the Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. The lower salinity in the Madrigal Ocean indicates that there is a higher amount of fresh water inflow, which is typically caused by the presence of rivers and streams that run into the ocean. In the case of the Arctic Ocean, its lower salinity compared to other major oceans is attributed to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. By applying this understanding to the Madrigal Ocean, one can reasonably assume that its lower salinity is due to a higher number of rivers emptying into it compared to the Listy Ocean."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig. To be as brief as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is quite the lackluster affair. While the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay.

They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B. But I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

There is no specific information about Population B's reflex times, but since they are a younger population, we can assume that their reflex times have not been negatively affected by aging as much as Population A.

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory.

Civilians, caught in the crossfire, faced the devastating consequences of this conflict, with casualties mounting on both sides. As the situation grew increasingly dire, international pressure mounted for a ceasefire and diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting resolution intensified. Despite the warnings from both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the violence escalated, taking a heavy toll on the infrastructures and lives of the people in the region. Buildings, already damaged by previous fighting, crumbled further, and essential services, such as hospitals and schools, found themselves struggling to cope. Relentless airstrikes and rocket attacks choked the skies over the region, stirring unease and fear among the local population. Amidst the mounting chaos, diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire came to the fore. World leaders and influential diplomats made urgent calls for dialogue and appealed for a return to negotiation, fearing the crisis could spiral out of control and plunge the region into even deeper turmoil. The international community grew steadily more concerned, closely monitoring the situation and offering their assistance in achieving peace. Unfortunately, mistrust and deeply entrenched animosity on both sides of the conflict made it difficult to find common ground. A series of failed ceasefires and broken promises only exacerbated the violence and dashed hopes for a speedy resolution. United Nations representatives urged for an immediate halt to hostilities and implored both sides to prioritize the protection of civilians, who bore the brunt of the devastation. As the conflict dragged on, the impacts on the Palestinian and Israeli populations only worsened. The numbers of dead and injured grew with each passing day, alongside those displaced from their homes. A humanitarian crisis loomed, with food and medical supplies dwindling, and access to clean water becoming dangerously scarce. International aid agencies worked tirelessly in an attempt to deliver essential resources and provide support to those affected. Against this bleak and seemingly unending backdrop, the involved parties chose to reevaluate their positions. Neither side appeared to be able to achieve a decisive victory, making it clear that military action alone would not bring an end to the violence. Further losses and suffering on both sides compelled them to return to the negotiating table, encouraging a shift towards more peaceful means of conflict resolution. Intermediaries helped to bring the Israeli and Palestinian leadership together, paving the way for renewed dialogue and communication. Through difficult negotiations, characterized by moments of tension, stubbornness, and ultimately a mutual willingness to achieve peace, they crafted a new ceasefire agreement that aimed to address the root causes of the conflict. The agreement, while not perfect, marked a significant step towards stability and peace in the region. Both sides made considerable concessions, and, with the help of international guarantors, took on the challenging task of rebuilding their fractured communities. The hardships endured throughout the conflict served as a chilling reminder of the toll that war takes on human lives, making it all the more imperative for both countries to foster trust and goodwill and to actively work towards achieving lasting peace in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He knew that in order to protect the recently polished exterior and intricately assembled engine-system from the wind-driven rains and possibly hail that the storm could potentially unleash upon the garage, he needed to act fast and come up with an efficient solution that would also not cost him a fortune. Having spent years in the automotive field, the mechanic swiftly reviewed his inventory of tools and spare materials while pondering over different ways he could cover the car completely. He also took into account the time constraint he found himself under and needed to make sure that his chosen method would not take up too much of his time as the storm clouds had already begun to darken the sky above. After much thought, he remembered an old idea that he had once come across in a magazine, where cars were covered by using multiple layers of cling film, protecting them from dust, dirt, and even water. Deciding that this makeshift solution might be his best option under the circumstances, the mechanic hurriedly located a large roll of industrial-grade cling film from the storage room and started working meticulously on wrapping the car from the roof all the way down to the undercarriage. He ensured that each layer was tightly wrapped around the contours of the car and properly sealed to avoid any moisture from seeping in. Once he was satisfied with the coverage, he doubled up on the cling film around the edges, further reinforcing them to make sure that the strong gusts of wind would not tear apart the plastic, leaving the car vulnerable. Finally, as a finishing touch, the mechanic wrapped one last layer of strong, waterproof fabric around the car, and tied it securely with ropes and carabiners to create a tight seal against the impending storm. And not a moment too soon, as the rain began to fall in earnest while the wind began picking up pace, howling and slamming into the garage with tremendous force. The mechanic took a moment to observe his handiwork, feeling a great relief in knowing that the car would be protected from the damages of the storm due to his quick thinking and resourcefulness. As the storm raged outside, the mechanic couldn't help but appreciate the power of adaptation and creativity in finding solutions to unexpected problems. He knew that no matter what challenges life would throw his way, as long as he remained open to learning and thinking outside the box, he would be able to rise above them and succeed. Indeed, it was this very attitude that had driven him to become the skilled and sought-after mechanic he was today, and as he watched the storm rage outside while the car remained safely blanketed in its protective cocoon, he couldn't help but feel a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that he had once again emerged as a master of his craft, conquering whatever obstacles were thrown his way."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. 1928 is in many ways a \\"lost year\\" in motion pictures. Just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology. \\"Show People\\" is one of the great silent era comedies. The film shows that William Haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. This movie is also exhibit A for illustrating that Marion Davies was no Susan Alexander Kane. She had excellent comic instincts and timing. This film starts out as the Beverly Hillbillies-like adventure of Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) and her father, General Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper, fresh from the old South. General Pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. While at the studio commissary, the Peppers run into Billy Boone (William Haines), a slapstick comedian. He gets Peggy an acting job. She's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and Billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. Soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn't really love, unless fate somehow intervenes. One of the things MGM frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at MGM circa 1930. This film is one of those, as we get Charlie Chaplin trying to get Peggy's autograph, an abundance of cameos of MGM players during that era including director King Vidor himself, and even a cameo of Marion Davies as Peggy seeing Marion Davies as Marion Davies arriving at work on the lot. Peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her. Truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while.

Movie plot title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities. Harmonica rebuffs an offer by Frank to buy the farm from him for...

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language you have used in your text is Romanian. Romanian is a Romance language spoken primarily in Romania and Moldova. It developed from the Vulgar Latin spoken in the region of the Danube by the Romans in late antiquity. It shares significant similarities with other Romance languages like Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan. However, due to its geographical location, it also contains elements from non-Romance languages such as Hungarian, German, and Slavic languages, particularly Bulgarian and Serbian. The text’s structure also indicates its linguistic roots. For instance, word endings often change according to gender, number, and case - a feature typical of Romance languages. The word “președintele”, for instance, is a masculine noun that changes form when the gender or number changes. Furthermore, Romanian language uses diacritical marks, like in words \\"preşedintele\\" and \\"daţi-mi\\", which modify the sound of the letter they mark. In terms of its vocabulary, the text also displays the influence of Latin to the Romanian language. For example, “condoleanţele” is a noun form of the verb “to condole,” and can be directly traced back to the Latin verb condolere, meaning “to deeply feel or express sympathy.” Similarly, “victimelor” is a plural form of the noun \\"victima\\" which means \\"victim\\". Words like these mirror those found in other Romance languages. The text itself seems to be a formal political discourse or statement, as indicated by its refined language and the presence of words such as “președinte” (president), “tema” (topic), “dezbatere” (debate) and other formal phrasings such as “dați-mi voie” (allow me). This language is part of the Indo-European language family, the largest language family in terms of native speakers and number of languages. Despite the country’s isolation from the rest of Latin-speaking Western Europe, the Romanian language has managed to preserve its Latin roots while also incorporating other linguistic features from surrounding languages due to historical and geographical influences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Swiss voters reject 'money for nothing' universal income proposal LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have guaranteed everyone in the Alpine nation an unconditional basic income, according to projections published Sunday by public broadcaster SRF1. The plan could have seen people in this wealthy nation of 8 million people receive about 2,500 Swiss francs (2,560) per month — enough to cover their basic needs. Proponents argued that a basic income would free people from meaningless toil and allow them to pursue more productive or creative goals in life. Critics said the plan would explode the state budget and encourage idleness, arguments that appear to have convinced voters. Based on a partial count of results from 19 Swiss cantons (states), the gfs.bern polling group calculated that 78 percent of voters opposed the measure against 22 percent in favor. The Swiss government itself advised voters to reject the proposal put forward by left-wing campaigners who collected the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a vote on the issue. But the idea has won over some economists, who say it could replace traditional welfare payments and give everybody the same chances in life. Salaried workers who earned more than basic income would have received no extra money, while children would have received one-quarter of the total for adults. The Dutch city of Utrecht is planning a two-year experiment with a similar plan, handing money to residents who already receive welfare benefits. The unconditional basic income proposal was one of five measures up for decision nationwide Sunday. Proposals to reform publicly owned companies and financing of transport routes was rejected, while voters backed plans to simplify the application procedures for asylum-seekers and another that will allow screening of embryos before they are implanted in the womb.

Some people thought this was a good idea because it would help people with their basic needs, and let them do more creative or helpful things in life. However, most people in Switzerland did not agree with this idea. They thought it would cost the government too much money and make people lazy. So, when they voted, 78% of people said \\"No\\" to the proposal. Even the Swiss government advised people to vote against it. But there are still some places in the world that want to try this idea, like a city in the Netherlands called Utrecht. They will experiment with giving money to some residents for two years.

No. Now, to answer your first question: How realistic is the best text-to-speech software? The realism of the best text-to-speech (TTS) software has improved significantly over the years. Early TTS systems sounded robotic and lacked natural intonation, making them difficult to listen to for extended periods. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning have greatly enhanced the realism and quality of TTS software. Today's best TTS software utilizes sophisticated algorithms to generate speech that is nearly indistinguishable from human voices. These algorithms analyze natural language patterns and utilize deep learning techniques to produce more realistic speech output, capturing the intricacies of human speech such as pitch, rate, and intonation. As a result, the best TTS software can output speech that sounds smooth, fluid, and expressive, closely resembling the unique qualities of a human voice. Furthermore, modern TTS systems can understand and correctly pronounce complex words, abbreviations, and even foreign languages with a high degree of accuracy. In spite of these advancements, some discrepancies may still be present, such as slight deviations in pronunciation or expression compared to a natural human voice. Nevertheless, the gap between human and synthetic speech continues to narrow as technology and AI progress. Now, to answer your second question: What is the best text-to-speech software? Identifying the best text-to-speech software is a subjective matter, as it depends on the user's specific needs and preferences. However, some of the top TTS software in the market, known for their quality and realism, are as follows: 1. Google Text-to-Speech: Powered by Google's robust machine learning technology, it produces natural-sounding speech. This TTS solution is widely used in various applications, including Google Assistant, Google Translate, and several third-party apps. 2. Amazon Polly: Amazon Polly is another highly realistic TTS system that utilizes deep learning techniques to produce lifelike speech. It offers a wide range of voices and languages, making it a popular choice for content creators and developers. 3. Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Speech Service: This cloud-based TTS service, part of Microsoft's Azure platform, provides an extensive selection of voices and languages, with powerful customization features to control aspects like pitch, rate, and pronunciation. 4. IBM Watson Text to Speech: Leveraging IBM's Watson technology, this TTS service offers quality speech synthesis with support for various languages and fine-tuning options. 5. Nuance Vocalizer: Nuance has long been a leader in speech recognition and synthesis. Their Vocalizer product offers high-quality TTS with extensive language support and customization options to create more natural-sounding voice outputs. Each of these TTS software options has unique features and strengths, so the decision on which is the best depends on the specific requirements and intended use. It is essential to consider factors such as voice quality, language options, customization capabilities, and cost when selecting the ideal TTS software for one's needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Practical effects of designating al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" resulted in small achievement after what date?\\" is \\"March 10\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Practical effects of designating al Qaeda a 'foreign terrorist organization' resulted in small achievement after what date?\\" is not \\"March 10\\". Rather, it is \\"October 1999\\", as mentioned in the paragraph, \\"After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a 'foreign terrorist organization,' it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures. I am facing a new situation today: Ned learned about reactions at a higher temperature for his physics class, while Paul had to learn about reactions at lower temperatures. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied about a slower reaction rate?","completion":"To answer the question correctly, let's think step-by-step and justify our steps based on the knowledge acquired from the background article: Step 1: Identify the main concepts from the background article.

In the new situation, Ned learned about reactions at higher temperatures, and Paul learned about reactions at lower temperatures. Step 3: Apply the knowledge from the background article to the new situation. According to the background article, reactions at lower temperatures have a slower reaction rate. Step 4: Answer the question correctly based on the analysis and knowledge applied.

In the first quarter, the Bears scored first when Jordan Howard ran for a 3-yard touchdown to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Steelers managed to tie it up at 7-7 when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 7-yard pass. The Bears moved ahead by double digits later on when Mike Glennon found Adam Shaheen on a 2-yard pass to make it 14-7. This would be followed up by Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal to make it 17-7 at halftime. After the break, the Steelers got back to work and came within 3 as Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 17-14. They would tie the game up in the fourth quarter when Chris Boswell nailed a 32-yard field goal.

See options at the end On a sunny day in the park, Betty asked Emily if - Betty hoped not to encounter a dog.. - Emily hoped not to encounter a dog..","completion":"On a sunny day in the park, Betty asked Emily if Emily hoped not to encounter a dog. The reason behind this question was their conversation in which Emily had previously mentioned that she had a not-so-positive experience with a dog in the past, which had caused her to develop an uneasy feeling towards dogs. While she didn't necessarily dislike dogs, she felt apprehensive whenever she encountered one, especially if it was off-leash. Betty was inquisitive and genuinely concerned about her friend's past experience and how it had developed into a deep-seated fear. She wanted to provide support to Emily and ensure that their day at the park would be a joyful experience – free of any stress or anxiety. When Emily responded to Betty's question, she explained that while she did have a bit of anxiety around dogs, she didn't want it to ruin their time at the park. She acknowledged that her fear was something she needed to work on and that keeping her distance from any dog they may come across would be the best approach for the time being. Emily also appreciated Betty's understanding and willingness to create a comfortable environment for her. Upon hearing Emily's response, Betty suggested that they should choose a spot to sit that was relatively free from any dogs that might unexpectedly come up to them. This showed Betty's empathy and consideration for Emily's feelings and her desire to be accommodating. They found a perfect spot beneath a large tree in a quieter corner of the park. The rest of the day was filled with laughter and deep conversations, enabling Emily to momentarily forget about her fear. Betty took the opportunity to encourage Emily to seek therapy or support groups for individuals who shared her fear of dogs, hoping that it might help her overcome her apprehension in the long run. The day ended on a positive note, as the two friends were able to enjoy their time together at the park. Betty's understanding and support towards Emily's situation showcased the true meaning of friendship and how empathy plays an essential role in creating a comfortable and nurturing environment. It was clear that Emily appreciated Betty's efforts, and this cemented their bond as friends – always being there for each other through thick and thin. In conclusion, the sentence should end like this: \\"On a sunny day in the park, Betty asked Emily if Emily hoped not to encounter a dog.\\" This ending exemplifies a genuine concern from Betty and becomes the central focus of a meaningful day at the park, where friendship and empathy take center stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the questionable comedy vein of Mel Brooks, \\"Wholly Moses!\\" tries to take the Bible story of Moses and make fun of it, resulting in the unfunniest Biblical spoof ever filmed. There is no real plot here, just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles. Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman are on a bus tour of the Holy Land, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. There they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda, also played by Moore and Newman. Herschel's life parallels Moses'. He was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh's family at the same time Moses was. Herschel's birth father, the late James Coco, becomes Herschel's slave after Herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. Eventually Herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer, is banished, and ends up tending Moses' flock of sheep. Herschel and Moses are brothers in law, marrying sisters, and Herschel thinks God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt. Of course, Moses was receiving the Divine Word, but Herschel misunderstood. I'll pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving Moore and actors who are making \\"special appearances.\\" These scenes do not propel the plot forward, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt. Jack Gilford plays a tailor. Dom DeLuise has maybe three lines when he meets Herschel in the desert. John Houseman is an archangel, just giving the same line readings he gave in \\"The Paper Chase.\\" David L. Lander is a fake blind man \\"healed\\" by Herschel. Andrea Martin is one of Zerelda's sisters. I was not sure who Madeline Kahn was supposed to be, she gives a ride to Herschel, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil. Richard Pryor has one scene as the pharaoh, but it was obviously shot at a different time than Moore's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! In the end, Zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on New Sodom's destruction, ha ha. Herschel writes the Ten Commandments, and gives them to Moses, who is basking in all the glory. In the final scenes, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having Herschel bait God into an argument. God comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading Herschel around for his own amusement, speaking through him only to give him the Ten Commandments. We even have Zerelda quip \\"God works in mysterious ways,\\" thereby excusing everyone's very unChristian behavior during the film. This film is not funny. There is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. At least Monty Python made fun of many established religious mainstays in \\"Life of Brian\\" in addition to their questionable take on Jesus' life, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads. This makes Mel Brooks look like Merchant/Ivory. Churchgoers will be offended, not by the film's attitude toward religion, but by the smugness the movie exhibits, impressed with their own hoitytoityness (I know, not a word) on a subject they obviously know nothing about. \\"Wholly Moses!\\" is wholly bad, and an embarassment to all involved.

In this Romanian translation, the sentence retains the original meaning and tone, expressing the idea that those who have wasted the wealth generated by a hardworking and creative population must be held responsible for their actions. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: - Acești oameni (These people) - This is used as a subject, referring to the people who squandered the wealth. In Romanian, the definite article is attached to the end of the noun, and 'acești' is the plural masculine form of 'these.' - au risipit (squandered) - The Romanian verb 'a risipi' translates to 'squander' and is conjugated here in the perfect compound tense, which is used for expressing a completed action in the past. - bogăția (the wealth) - The noun 'bogăție' means wealth, and the '-a' ending shows the singular form of the noun with a definite article. - creată (created) - The past participle of the verb 'a crea' (to create) is 'creat' for the masculine form and 'creată' for the feminine form. As 'bogăția' is a feminine noun, we use 'creată' in this context. - de o populație energică și inovatoare (by an energetic and innovative population) - This phrase describes the source of the 'wealth.' 'O populație' means 'a population,' while 'energică' means 'energetic' and 'inovatoare' means 'innovative.' Both adjectives are feminine singular forms, as they refer to the feminine noun 'populație.' - și trebuie (and they must) - The conjunction 'și' means 'and,' and 'trebuie' is the impersonal verb 'to must' or 'have to.' - să fie trași la răspundere (be held accountable) - The verb 'a trage la răspundere' means 'to hold accountable,' and it is conjugated here using the subjunctive mood, which is often used for expressing obligation or necessity. 'Să fie trași' is the auxiliary construction that serves as the subjunctive verb for the masculine plural form, which refers back to 'these people.'"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Margaret Holliday had to be rescued by paramedics after her silver Hyundai Getz was left teetering on the edge of the wall and another resident's lawn in Moseley, Birmingham. The 81-year-old was trying to edge back out of her garage when her brakes failed and sent her flying backwards, at about midday on Saturday afternoon. The woman, in her eighties, had a lucky escape after she managed to get her car stuck on top of a brick wall. Her car became stuck and had to be hoisted off the three brick high wall by the fire service. She said: 'I was just parking up in my garage when I realised I was still a bit close to the entrance and the door wouldn't shut so I needed to edge back just about six inches. 'But instead of being six inches it ended up being more like six metres. 'As I took my foot off the brake it launched backwards out of the garage, across the little bit of lawn - by gosh it was scary. 'Then the car was just teetering on the wall - it's only small so I thought I'd be able to get out. 'I didn't realise how high up I was and when I tried to step out, I tumbled out, banged my head and ended up on my bum. Fire crews believe she got her foot jammed on the accelerator as she attempted to reverse out of her garage.

Here's a question: What might a fish avoid for safety? Here are possible answers to this question: - stream - end of line - market - pond - boat I believe the correct choice is \\"boat\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"A fish might avoid a boat for safety, and there are several reasons behind this choice. While each of the options listed – stream, end of line, market, pond, and boat – pose their own potential risks to fish, the most immediate and direct threat to the fish's safety comes from boats. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Boats: Boats pose the most significant and immediate danger to fish, specifically due to fishing activities carried out by humans. Boats often are equipped with fishing gear such as nets or lines, and being in close proximity to a boat increases the likelihood of a fish being caught, injured, or killed. Additionally, boats can cause disturbances to the water, which may disrupt the fish's natural habitat and lead to stress or injury. Noise pollution from boat engines can also disorient and distress fish, affecting their ability to navigate and communicate with each other. 2. Stream: While a fish might avoid a stream if it's polluted, streams are generally considered natural habitats for many species of fish. Unless the stream is polluted or obstructed, a fish is unlikely to avoid one for safety reasons. In fact, streams can provide necessary resources for fish, like food, shelter, and a means of transportation to other areas for breeding or migration. 3. End of line: It is unclear what \\"end of line\\" refers to in this context. If it is related to the end of a fishing line, then it might be a potential danger for a fish to avoid. However, since it's not directly specified here, it seems less of a threat compared to a boat, which implies the presence of fishing equipment. 4. Market: Fish markets are major threats to the safety of fish, as they represent a location where fish end up once they have been captured and killed. However, fish markets do not pose a direct danger to fish still in the water, as they are not located underwater. 5. Pond: Like streams, ponds are natural habitats for many fish species. Although there may be cases where ponds could be unsafe for fish (e.g., if they are polluted or overcrowded), these bodies of water generally provide necessary resources for their inhabitants and are essential for the sustainability of fish populations. In conclusion, a fish would most likely avoid a boat for safety due to the direct and immediate danger posed by fishing activities, disturbances to water and noise pollution. Other options, such as a stream or pond, may have potential dangers in certain cases, but these bodies of water are generally considered natural habitats, providing shelter and resources for fish. While markets are dangerous for fish that have been captured, they do not pose a direct threat to fish in their natural environment. The \\"end of line\\" is an unclear term, but it is less directly threatening compared to a boat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both sentences describe a young boy mistreated by his parents, who offers part of his meal to someone else. However, the major difference lies in the descriptions of the individuals that the mistreated boy offers his meal to. In the first sentence, \\"A strange dark boy, mistreated by his parents, offers a young rider a play of his meal,\\" the mistreated boy is described as a strange, dark boy. He offers his meal to a young rider. Additionally, the word \\"play\\" in this context seems to be a typo or error, most likely meant to be \\"part\\" or \\"piece\\" of his meal, which would make more sense in the given context. In the second sentence, \\"A young boy, mistreated by his parents, offers a strange dark rider a piece of his meal,\\" the mistreated boy is simply described as a young boy, without any further specifications about his appearance. This time, he offers his meal to a strange, dark rider. The description \\"strange, dark rider\\" distinguishes this character from the young rider in the previous sentence. In conclusion, due to the differences in the descriptions of the characters involved, the two sentences do not have the same meaning, even though they share some similarities.

Yes; b). No; Answer:","completion":"b). No; The correct response to the question \\"heating salt water leaves the salt where?\\" is not \\"on the surface\\". When you heat salt water, the water evaporates and turns into steam. This process is called evaporation. Salt is a non-volatile solute and does not convert into a gas when heated. Therefore, it remains behind in the container where the water was heated. The salt is left at the bottom of the container, not on the surface. This is a result of a process called distillation, which separates mixtures based on differences in their volatilities in a boiling liquid mixture. So, despite the given assumption that heating salt water leaves the salt on the surface, this is scientifically incorrect.

There will be 4 columns: number 1, day 1, hour 2, hour 3, day 7, day 13, day 21..","completion":"The other columns should be labeled each day of the week to easily identify the activities you have planned for each specific day. Starting from the second column, label it as Monday, followed by Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in the subsequent columns. After you have labeled each column with the days of the week, you can proceed to fill in the time slots in the first, left-most column; for example, if you wake up at 7 am and go to bed at 11 pm, the initial row in the left column should read 7 am. Then, fill in the remaining time slots in the left column in increments of your choice, such as 30 minutes or hourly intervals, depending on your personal preference and the granularity of your daily activities. Once you have your columns and times established, begin to populate your spreadsheet with your daily activities, tasks, and appointments. For each day of the week, fill in the corresponding time slots with the tasks you have planned, making sure to include any recurring responsibilities, such as work, school, or exercise, as well as unique events like meetings, social engagements, or appointments. Additionally, allocate time for self-care rituals, such as meal preparation, relaxation, and personal hygiene. To maximize productivity and prevent burnout, be sure to incorporate breaks within your schedule. Dedicating time for rest will allow you to recharge and maintain focus throughout the day. Also, remember to include buffers between activities to accommodate for any unexpected adjustments in your timetable. This flexibility will ensure that your daily routine remains organized and manageable. Furthermore, prioritizing routines that occur during the most productive times of your day can help enhance overall efficiency. For example, if you tend to be more energetic in the mornings, consider scheduling vital and demanding tasks during this time. Conversely, if you generally feel sluggish in the afternoons, reserve this timeframe for less strenuous undertakings or leisure activities, adjusting as needed based on your energy patterns. Finally, commit to regularly updating and refining your schedule to accommodate your evolving needs and preferences. Take time to evaluate the effectiveness of your routine, as well as to identify areas requiring improvement. Through consistent evaluation and adjustment, you can optimize your organization, productivity, and satisfaction with your routine, ultimately ensuring that it successfully serves your goals and lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: That Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, was a satirical television comedy programme on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. A Canadian show, This Hour Has Seven Days, aired from 1964 to 1966 on CBC. Although partially inspired by That Was The Week That Was, the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two series amid allegations of political interference. This Hour Has 22 Minutes, created by Newfoundland comic Mary Walsh, has been running since 1992 although the two are not related. An Australian show, The Mavis Bramston Show, aired from 1964 to 1968 on the Seven Network. It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue--most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s--but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially TW3 and Not Only... But Also. The New Zealand show A Week Of It ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians David McPhail, Peter Rowley and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians Jon Gadsby and Annie Whittle. The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, McPhail and Gadsby in similar vein. A Dutch version, Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer, aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the Lord's Prayer (\\"Give us this day our daily television\\"). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: Mies Bouwman. After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award--though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged. An Indian version titled The Week That Wasn't was launched and hosted by Cyrus Broacha.

(CNN)A substance described as \\"white stuff\\" and \\"milky rain\\" is covering parts of Washington and Oregon states, but its origin is a mystery. \\"We have received reports of 'white stuff' on vehicles. The ash is more than likely from the Volcano Shiveluch,\\" Washington state's Walla Walla County Emergency officials said in statement. The volcano, located on the Kamchatka peninsula in extreme northeast Russia, \\"spewed an ash plume to about the 20,000-foot level in late January,\\" the agency says. \\"It has been deposited in a widespread area, including Washington and Oregon.\\" But in an updated post, emergency officials say it could be as a result of various reasons. \\"While the substance is likely ash is from Volcano Shiveluch, they are a number of volcanoes that are currently active,\\" they say. \\"The source of the material has not been scientifically confirmed.\\" And the ash may be from another part of the world. \\"The strong southerly flow from the jet stream could have brought it from an active volcano in southwest Colima, Mexico. But if we go farther west towards eastern Russia, there's another active volcano there,\\" says CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. The Mexican volcano is near Guadalajara and erupted Wednesday. The distances between the volcanoes and the Washington/Oregon areas are staggering -- the Russian volcano is 4,000 miles away and the volcano in Mexico is more than 2,000 miles away. But there are some other theories floating around. \\"We have heard a few theories thus far including; volcanic ash from Mexico or Russia, dust picked up from last night's strong winds, or perhaps ash from last year's wildfires over SE Oregon/SW Idaho.

Harold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 - 13 January 2004) was a British general practitioner and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen murders for killing patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released. The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman's crimes. In March 1998, Linda Reynolds of the Donneybrook Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Son's funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; the Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman's eventual arrest, he killed three more people. His last victim was Kathleen Grundy, who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. Shipman was the last person to see her alive and later signed her death certificate, recording \\"old age\\" as the cause of death. In August 1998, taxi driver John Shaw, from Hyde, contacted the police, informing them that he suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left PS386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, and she went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict and showed them comments in his computerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will. The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of 15 specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health. Prescription For Murder, a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, advanced two theories on Shipman's motive for forging the will: that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control, or that he planned to retire at age 55 and leave the UK. In 2003, David Spiegelhalter et al. suggested that \\"statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did he kill them?","completion":"Harold Frederick Shipman killed his victims by administering lethal doses of diamorphine, a drug often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. After administering the fatal doses, he would sign the patients' death certificates and then falsify medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it, and the dominos lead to increasing peril, adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease. Is the plot over the top? Yes.

It is not possible to tell Although the statement \\"The men fight during the game\\" suggests that there is some level of conflict or interaction between the men in question, it doesn't provide enough information to determine their exact location or involvement. As a result, we cannot confidently assert that \\"The men are at the game.\\" Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. Insufficient information about the context: The given statement does not clarify the context in which the phrase \\"the game\\" is being used. Without knowing what type of game is being referred to (e.g., a sports match, a board game, or a video game), it is impossible to ascertain if the men's physical presence is necessary for participation. In a situation where the game is an online multiplayer video game, for example, the men might not be at an actual physical game location. 2. Ambiguity in the term \\"fight\\": The word \\"fight\\" can have multiple interpretations depending on the situation. It could mean a physical altercation, a verbal disagreement, or even a metaphorical clash, such as a competition or rivalry. In any case, its presence doesn't necessarily imply that the men are physically present at the game location. 3. Possibility of simultaneous events: Even if we do assume that \\"the game\\" refers to a physical location, such as a sports match, the statement does not provide enough evidence that the men's fight occurs while they are at the game. It is possible that the men are fighting nearby or elsewhere and happen to do so during a sports match taking place elsewhere. In conclusion, given the ambiguity and lack of context in the statement, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The men are at the game.\\" Therefore, the correct response is \\"b. it is not possible to tell.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Summarize this article: Hardliners have been on a political warpath this week after the first visit to Tehran by the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. \\"Do you think our country has no order that you can go anywhere you want and see anyone you want to see?\\" the head of the judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, demanded on Tuesday night. Leading clerics from the holy city of Qom have now added their voice, accusing the West of \\"reviving the plot of the soft revolution\\", a reference to the widespread street protests - blamed on foreign powers - that were sparked by the disputed 2009 presidential election. When Baroness Ashton first landed in Tehran last weekend, moderate newspapers hailed her arrival as an \\"achievement\\" of the reformist President Hassan Rouhani. His Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has established a good working relationship with Europe's top diplomat during their months of negotiations which led to November's landmark interim deal on Iran's nuclear programme. Now Mr Zarif, as well as Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, has been summoned to appear before parliament to answer questions. Hardliners have zeroed in on what is being denounced as Baroness Ashton's \\"controversial meeting\\". Their target is a small gathering with seven female human rights activists at the very start of her mission, which coincided with International Women's Day. The presence of Narges Mohammadi, the acting head of Iran's Centre for the Defenders of Human Rights, attracted some of the greatest attention. She has been to prison five times since her days as a student activist, and is now on bail. \\"The better Iran's relations with the world become, the more open the political climate in Iran becomes, and the more active our civil society,\\" Ms Mohammadi told me. Baroness Ashton spoke of \\"the great privilege to meet women to talk about issues for women in Iran and across the world,\\" as she stood next to Mr Zarif at a news conference on Sunday. On Wednesday, a small crowd of protesters, mainly from an Islamic Association of University Students, gathered outside the residence of the Austrian ambassador in Tehran where the meeting with the female activists - meant to be a low-key discussion - was held the previous Saturday evening. \\"If Mrs Ashton is concerned about women and human rights, she should go take care of the women in Europe,\\" one student association declared earlier this week. \\"This backlash was to be expected,\\" a prominent editor of one of Iran's conservative media told me. \\"It will subside.\\" But it is also clear the deeply-rooted suspicion will not go away. Hardline politicians, still smarting from President Rouhani's emphatic victory in last year's elections, also see this as an opportunity to step up the pressure to try to weaken the reformist government, including negotiations on the future of Iran's nuclear programme. \\"They will try to keep the flame alive,\\" said one Iranian commentator. There has been less comment so far from more moderate media. But a cautious appreciation of her visit was quoted earlier this week. \\"It can have a positive effect on the process of Iran's nuclear talks and the promotion of our country's relations with the European Union,\\" remarked Ahmad Shohani, a member of the parliament's security and foreign policy committee. As we walked through Tehran's crowded bazaars this week, Iranians often asked us what kind of impact her visit would have. \\"When senior officials visit it gives us hope,\\" said Mehdi whose family has been in the carpet business for more than three decades. \\"When more junior officials come, we worry.\\" \\"We definitely welcome her visit,\\" emphasised a woman carrying bags of Iranian nuts and sweets in preparation for the upcoming Persian New Year on 21 March. \\"It's not good to live in isolation.\\" \\"Ashton and her friends should deal with the government,\\" insisted another man who lamented the high prices caused by years of international sanctions. \\"We cannot make a long wall around ourselves but the EU and the Iranian government have to show good intentions.\\" Baroness Ashton was clear from the start that human rights were an important part of her greater engagement with Iran. She often makes a point of talking to women wherever she visits. \\"She would have been criticised if she did not reach out to Iranian women, especially since it was International Women's Day,\\" commented one of her advisers. Her approach in Iran was carefully framed as a \\"potential human rights dialogue in future\\". European diplomats say the idea to put human rights on the agenda was first suggested by Iran's delegation during a meeting at the United Nations in September. Both Baroness Ashton and the Iranian leaders she met in Tehran have spoken positively about their talks earlier this week. \\"I've met people who've played a role in Iran, not just now but historically, and we were able to talk about the potential to do other things, including human rights,\\" Baroness Ashton told me and the few other journalists who came to cover her visit. After meeting her, President Hassan Rouhani spoke of the need to \\"interact constructively\\" with the entire world, including Europe, based on \\"common interests and mutual respect\\". His unofficial Twitter account @HassanRouhani used the hashtag #Constructive_Engagement. Mr Minister Zarif also spoke about the potential to co-operate in other areas, including action against drug trafficking from neighbouring Afghanistan, the battle against \\"terrorism\\", and the \\"dangerous\\" situation in Syria. But Baroness Ashton also made it clear that progress on any front would depend on the success or failure of difficult talks on a long-term comprehensive nuclear accord, which will resume on 17 March in Vienna. \\"I am leaving here knowing there is support for those who are going to come to negotiate,\\" she told me. \\"But there's so much to do and we have to be cautiously optimistic.\\" Even deeper scepticism was reiterated again this week by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \\"Our officials have started negotiations. We hope they will come to a conclusion but we are not optimistic,\\" he commented during one of his audiences. Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly warned that the nuclear talks are a \\"pretext in the hands of the West\\" to interfere in Iran's affairs. \\"Ashton has given some hope to the moderates, some food to the hardliners,\\" was how one Iranian observer summarised this rare visit by a senior Western official. \\"This is Iran.\\"","completion":"EU Foreign Policy Chief, Catherine Ashton's, recent visit to Tehran sparked backlash from Iranian hardliners. Ashton's meeting with seven female human rights activists during her trip coincided with International Women's Day and drew criticism. The meeting attracted attention particularly due to the presence of Narges Mohammadi, the acting head of Iran's Centre for the Defenders of Human Rights. However, some believe this backlash is temporary and will subside.

He subdues and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking, but surprisingly philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, and Nazi soldiers. Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart gathers the townspeople and the black and Chinese railroad workersâwho have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the communityâto build a fake town as a diversion. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town; but with no people in it, Bart realizes it won't fool Lamarr's villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \\"William J. Le PÃ©tomane Memorial Thruway\\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \\"a shitload of dimes\\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town... A:","completion":"In the movie Blazing Saddles, the dummies in the fake town are not explicitly mentioned to be booby-trapped with any specific devices or explosives. However, the intent behind creating the fake town and the dummies is to serve as a diversion and delay tactic to confuse and stall Hedley Lamarr's army of thugs. By building the \\"William J. Le Pétomane Memorial Thruway\\" with a tollbooth, Bart, Jim, and Mongo are able to further delay the raiding party as they have to turn back for \\"a shitload of dimes\\" to pay the toll. When Lamarr's villains finally attack the fake town, they are not met with any direct booby traps, but they do engage in a chaotic and lengthy battle with the real townspeople and railroad workers, who are hiding behind the dummies. This clever plan allows Bart and his allies to face off against the villains on their own terms, strategically and with the element of surprise. In summary, the dummies in the fake town are not explicitly booby-trapped with any specific devices, but they serve as a key part of the plan to distract, confuse, and stall Hedley Lamarr's villains while the real townspeople and railroad workers mount a defense against them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: The Biden-Palin Debate - Forbes.com If the Republican National Committee has not already wired substantial sums into the Swiss bank accounts of Charles Gibson and Katie Couric, they were robbed. Their interviews with Sarah Palin, in which the Alaskan governor came out looking like a first-class ditz, are an example of what Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan used to call political jujitsu. Now, despite the imaginings of Democrats, the Republicans are nowhere near audacious enough to cook up a plot in which Palin, in the weeks before Thursday night's vice presidential debate, would be made to look like a fool so she could startle the debate audience with the news that she is not a fool at all. Palin looked unprepared in the interviews in large part because she was unprepared. Nonetheless, because of them, it was impossible for the Obama campaign to counter the expectation that she would implode right on stage. She did not implode. In this limited sense, she definitely won. Whether she won in a larger sense brings us to the matter of the cultural divide that runs as strongly as ever under the river of American politics. If you were disposed not to like Palin, you would say that Sen. Joe Biden spoke with considerably more sophistication about policy. You would argue that her answers, though improved from past performances, still sounded like talking points. You would say she was manipulative with her down-home stories, her shout-out, her ever-present hockey mom references and her cute little black suit with the big American flag--with rhinestones, yet. If you were disposed to like Palin, you would note that Biden, while informed, sounded like--well, a politician. You would argue that his answers, though spoken in a language familiar to the East and West coasts, were just as formulaic as hers. You would say that her ability to connect with her audience came not merely from manipulation but from the fact that her words and rhythms of speech really did mirror those of her audience. From the point of view of a cosmopolitan (including most visitors to Forbes.com), Palins performance did not compute. True, she held her own with Biden, meaningless voting statistic for meaningless voting statistic. Yet she spoke the mantras--personal responsibility, low taxes, good jobs, shining city on a hill--that seemed fundamentally inconsistent with the depth of experience needed to govern. Most of all, there was her voice. Bidens voice was sometimes passionate but let us understand that he had been there, done that. Palins voice was high, perky, earnest, naive, twangy, aw-shucks and altogether unreflective of the weariness, ironies ambiguities that we expect from a leader who has seen and understood the world. That was what Palins voice sounded like to cosmopolitans. Clearly, it did not sound that way to much of the country. Lots of Americans actually talk the way Palin talks (even some of us from Buffalo, which is pretty far east, have been asked to tone down the Midwestern accent). More, for many listeners, her phrases--its not our fault that the economy is hurting, but we have to learn the lessons so well never be taken advantage of this way again; there are blunders, but you cant keep pointing backward if you want to move forward--are not platitudes; they are meaningful indicators of how a leader will govern and are about as concrete as you can get in a presidential debate. If a participant in one of these debates ever actually outscored his or her opponent on substantive points, the winner would not be a good bet to lead the country. These debates penalize palpable ignorance but do not and should not reward expertise. They test whether a candidate can cite an array of plausible facts within a framework that speaks to the beliefs of listeners. As Disraeli put it more elegantly, Few ideas are correct ones, and what are correct no one can ascertain; but with words we govern men. No one knows how much Palins performance will help John McCains campaign. But if she is no longer an anchor on the campaign, it is because the debate showed--come to think of it, just as the bailout debate showed--that the country is a lot bigger than we sometimes fool ourselves into thinking it is. Suzanne Garment, a tax lawyer in New York, is the author of Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article discusses the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin during the 2008 US presidential campaign. The author highlights the key aspects of their debate and how their performance conveys different messages to different audiences - cosmopolitans and the rest of the country. 1. Sarah Palin's unexpected performance: The author suggests that despite being unprepared in previous interviews, Palin held her own during the debate, defying expectations that she would implode on stage. 2. The cultural divide in American politics: The article emphasizes the different reactions to Palin and Biden's performances based on the pre-existing disposition of the audience. If one disliked Palin, they would see her as less sophisticated and manipulative, while Biden appeared more informed and experienced. However, if one liked Palin, they would view her as genuine and relatable compared to Biden, who might come across as a typical politician. 3. Communication style differences: The article points out the contrast in Biden and Palin's styles of speaking, with Biden reflecting a sense of familiarity and experience while Palin's voice conveyed a sense of earnestness and naiveté. 4. Importance of language in politics: The author refers to Disraeli's quote, \\"Few ideas are correct ones, and what are correct no one can ascertain; but with words we govern men.\\" This highlights the significance of language and rhetoric in shaping people's beliefs and views on leadership, emphasizing that the substance of the debate is less important than the delivery and perceived trustworthiness of the candidates. 5. Impact on the Presidential campaign: The outcome of the Palin-Biden debate had the potential to either lift or drag down John McCain's campaign. By not imploding during the debate, Palin may have removed herself as an anchor on McCain's campaign, demonstrating the complexities and vastness of American political culture. In summary, the most important aspects of this news article revolve around the contrasting performances of Sarah Palin and Joe Biden during their vice-presidential debate, the cultural divide in American politics, and the critical role language and communication play in shaping public opinion and influencing the presidential campaign."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

While they appreciate the appearance and the functionality of the CD and cassette recorder, they express disappointment with the radio's sound quality, saying that it is so poor that they couldn't use it. Given this information, it is difficult to definitively say whether the user would recommend the product or not without knowing what aspects of the product are most important to them or other potential buyers. However, we can analyze the review further to speculate about the likelihood of them recommending the product overall. On the one hand, the user enjoyed the looks of the recorder, and both the CD and cassette recorder functioned well. These are positive aspects which may indicate that the user might recommend the product to someone who is primarily interested in a CD and cassette recorder with an appealing design. In this case, the poor sound quality of the radio may not be a deal-breaker for the user. On the other hand, the radio's poor sound quality is a significant issue highlighted by the user. This aspect could be a crucial factor for many potential buyers, as a radio with poor sound quality may not be fit for purpose. In addition, the fact that the user stated that they couldn't use the radio due to its sound quality is a strong negative point. This may lead to the user not recommending the product overall, especially to someone who is looking for a multi-functional device that includes a reliable radio. In conclusion, it is not explicitly clear whether the user would recommend the product based on the mixed feedback provided in their review. If the positive aspects, such as the design and functionality of the CD and cassette recorder, are more important to them or to other potential buyers than the negative aspects like the radio's poor sound quality, then they may recommend the product.

From Texas to Tennessee, there's not much relief in sight for people smacked by a frigid winter storm that killed at least four, shut down schools, backed up interstates and left hundreds of thousands without power. The National Weather Service predicted more sleet and subfreezing temperatures in Dallas and Memphis until Sunday and in Little Rock, Arkansas, until Monday. Other parts of the country braced for bad weather. The storm moved east Friday night, with snow expected to accumulate across the central Appalachians through central New England into early Saturday morning. Snow or sleet was expected to hit Washington, D.C., on Sunday. Dallas/Fort Worth took the hardest hit. It was colder in the Big D (26 degrees) than in Anchorage, Alaska (34 degrees), prompting the cancellation of the Dallas Marathon and spurring Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to cancel almost 700 flights, about 80% of those scheduled. About 200,000 customers lost electricity, and a local official urged people to offer shelter to those without power. Southbound Interstate 35 was shut down and traffic backed up for six miles, CNN affiliate WFAA in Dallas reported. The temperature swings were startling. Hot Springs, Arkansas, experienced a record high of 75 on Wednesday. By Friday morning, the city was in the middle of an ice storm. The storm caught a lot of Texans by surprise. Debra Knight, a CNN iReporter, said she ran her defroster 20 minutes but couldn't get rid of the thick layer of ice on top of her car in Dallas. \\"This is Texas. We don't have snow tools!\\" said her husband, Bobby. Storm deaths. In some cases, the weather has been deadly. In Texas, a passenger was killed Thursday in Hockley County when a vehicle lost control and crashed into another car, Sgt. Bryan Witt of the Texas Department of Public Safety said. An Arkansas man was killed late Thursday when a tree fell on his camper in Pope County, Tommy Jackson, an Arkansas Department of Emergency Management spokesman, said Friday. Jackson said the death was related to the weather but couldn't provide details about the weather at the time. Rain and freezing rain were reported in the area Thursday night. Highway Patrol officials in Oklahoma blamed at least one death, in Muskogee, on the weather. The agency initially said weather had caused another death, that of a 24-year-old man in Owasso, but later said this fatality \\"is still under investigation and may not be winter storm related.\\" No snow had fallen in New Mexico, but drivers dealt with snow and ice. One person died in a semi crash near Clines Corners. About 116 storm-related injuries have been reported in Oklahoma, including 48 falls, the state health department said. When not causing harm, the storm struck fear in residents. In Dallas, iReporter Earl Wallace IV said he when he heard a loud crack and a rush of wind and ran out to find a large tree had fallen on two nearby homes. \\"One of the homeowners emerged crying and talking on the phone,\\" said the 32-year-old creative director. \\"The tree had crashed down into her dining room. I felt nervous, shocked and scared for the families inside.\\" Two homes were damaged -- one with a giant hole in the roof -- but no one was injured.

Mike Beebe said. \\"During severe weather season, we know when conditions are ripe for tornadoes but never exactly where and when they could strike. In winter, that uncertainty takes a different form but can still create widespread anxiety,\\" he said. \\"Often, only a few degrees above or below the freezing mark can make the difference between a cold rain, a blanket of snow, an ice storm or a mixture of all of the above.\\" In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, roads were passable overnight, but it was a fine line as temperatures slipped below freezing. The slushy mess slowly turned into crunchy, bumpy ice. Police urged caution for anyone on the road and reported 21 major car accidents and 32 minor ones Friday. According to energy provider Oncor, more than 200,000 customers were without power in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area as of Friday morning. This is the largest concentration of outages, with scattered outages elsewhere in the state. Nearly 30,000 were without power in Arkansas, energy companies reported. The weather brought traffic at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport almost to a standstill. Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed, prompting Southwest Airlines and American Airlines to urge travelers to consider rebooking their flights. A dark cloud over Dallas events. The National Weather Service predicts a wintry mix of precipitation through Sunday. That forecast prompted the cancellation of a downtown Dallas holiday parade scheduled for Saturday for the first time in 26 years. The city also called off its annual marathon slated for Sunday and the accompanying Health & Fitness Expo scheduled for Friday and Saturday. \\"We regret that the race will not go on as planned, but are confident this decision is in the best interest of our runners, volunteers, spectators and the general public,\\" A Dallas Marathon statement said. While the focus Friday was on the ice storm stretching from Dallas to Memphis, Mother Nature looked ready to throw another punch. A wintry mix was forecast for Washington beginning about noon Sunday. The National Weather Service said it has the potential to be an ice storm from late Sunday afternoon through the evening hours, but temperatures are expected to rise above freezing by rush hour Monday. A new storm entered the West, bringing snow to the Pacific Coast on Friday. The storm brought significant snowfall to Portland, Oregon, and there is a chance for rare snow in Las Vegas on Saturday.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Jay Austin (Mark Harmon), a San Francisco police inspector, is sent to investigate. He clashes with Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery), the base Provost Marshal. Years ago, Austin and Lynch were partners while serving as MPs and Caldwell was their commanding officer. When Austin arrested Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence (Dana Gladstone), Caldwell didn't support him. In the aftermath, Austin was demoted and decided to leave the army.

The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence, who is the registered owner of a Tokarev. However, Lawrence claims that he lost it in a poker game. The film's plot revolves around the strained relationship between San Francisco police inspector Jay Austin and Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell, the Presidio Army base's Provost Marshal. The two share a mutual dislike and background, as they were once partners while serving as MPs, and Caldwell was Austin's commanding officer. Caldwell's refusal to support Austin in a previous incident involving the arrest of Lawrence resulted in Austin's demotion and departure from the army. As the murder investigation progresses, suspicion intensifies around Lawrence due to his connection with the murder weapon. Additionally, Austin discovers that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer is registered to a wealthy civilian named Arthur Peale. Peale owns a holding company involved in various businesses. Austin's attempt to question Lawrence about the Tokarev is blocked by Caldwell, which increases his suspicion that Caldwell will protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities at any cost. Caldwell and Austin eventually recognize that their jurisdictions overlap - part of the case falls under Caldwell's authority at the Presidio and part under Austin's authority in San Francisco. This forces them to form an uneasy partnership to investigate the case. During their investigation, Caldwell proposes that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch matches a bullet previously fired from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, he will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest. To further their investigation, Caldwell and Austin visit Peale, who claims his car was merely stolen, but his involvement remains ambiguous.

La structure de la taxe d'accise sur le tabac. Which language is this?","completion":"This sentence is in French. It says, \\"La structure de la taxe d'accise sur le tabac,\\" which translates to \\"The structure of the tobacco excise tax\\" in English. Tobacco excise taxes are imposed on tobacco products to generate revenue and decrease tobacco consumption by making them more expensive. They are typically applied at the manufacturer, wholesale, or retail level and can vary based on the type, quantity, and price of the products being taxed. There are different types of excise tax structures for tobacco products. Here is a detailed explanation of some of the common structures: 1. Specific Excise Tax: This tax structure is based on the quantity or volume of tobacco products, such as the number of cigarettes, weight of rolling tobacco, or volume of e-liquids for vaping devices. Specific taxes are imposed per unit, for example, 1 per 20-pack of cigarettes or 0.50 per gram of rolling tobacco. The advantage of specific taxes is that they can be adjusted more easily to keep up-to-date with inflation or to achieve specific public health policy goals. 2. Ad Valorem Excise Tax: This tax structure is based on the value of the tobacco product, usually a certain percentage of the wholesale or retail price. An ad valorem tax takes into consideration the differences in quality and price of tobacco products and automatically adjusts as prices increase or decrease. For example, a 15% ad valorem tax on a 10 pack of cigarettes would be 1.50. One disadvantage of ad valorem taxes is that they allow lower-priced products to remain relatively cheap, which may not be as effective in discouraging tobacco consumption compared to specific excise taxes. 3. Hybrid Excise Tax: This tax structure combines the features of both specific and ad valorem taxes. A tobacco product would be subject to both a fixed tax per unit and a percentage tax based on its value. This approach aims to take advantage of the strengths of both types of taxes and improve the fairness and stability of revenue collection. For example, a hybrid tax might impose a 1 specific tax per 20-pack of cigarettes and also apply a 10% ad valorem tax on the price. 4. Minimum Excise Tax (MET): The MET structure aims to ensure that the total taxes on tobacco products do not fall below a certain amount, regardless of the specific or ad valorem taxes applied. This is done to discourage producers and retailers from lowering their prices to offset tax increases and maintain retail prices at a level that discourages consumption. 5. Tiered Excise Tax: This tax structure applies different rates to various categories of tobacco products based on specific criteria, such as price, quality, or type of product. For example, premium cigarettes could be subject to a higher tax rate than economy cigarettes, or cigars could have a different rate than cigarettes. This approach can increase the complexity of tax administration and have varying impacts on public health goals, depending on the differences between the rates. Each country or jurisdiction determines its preferred excise tax structure depending on various factors, including public health goals, revenue needs, and administrative capacity. Many countries use a combination of the tax structures mentioned above to optimize their strategies for reducing tobacco consumption and generating revenue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: /* slight spoilers */ Way back, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, Gunbuster was made. With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon shorts or course, Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up. It didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera. Luckily, Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series. This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. Besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operas. For one, the shows starts out pretty light, with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. This makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out. The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. Besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. Smart as writer Okada was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. The science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series. The animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. The designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has it's charm. Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betray some of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest. The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. The last episode was entirely done in black and white. While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part. The music is very typical space opera fair. Too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is Dragon Half. If you think 80s anime music, you will know what to expect. As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. Neither aspect is ever left completely out though. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. While they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. Again, it fits the series. Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. The show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. Highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws. ***/***** What is the sentiment of this review?

Article: Store shelves are filling up with so-called \\"green\\" products promising to benefit the environment. A recent argument shows that it can be as difficult for buyers to confirm such statement as for producers to defend them. The argument concerns the GreenPlug Electricity Saver. The GreenPlug is supposed to prevent energy waste by electrical equipment whose constant -speed motors operate at less full load---as is especially true of older refrigerators. Research showed that such motors can be made to do the same work with less heat, noise, and power consumption just by lowering the voltage of the power supply. John and Wyck Hay, started Green Technologies to apply that finding to home appliances. In the USA, there are more than 140 million refrigerators in use, accounting for an average of 16% of the household electric bill. Two years of research resulted in the GreenPlug. Connecting between wall socket and refrigerator, the equipment contains a minicomputer that gives a motor full power (120 volts on average) for start-up, then reduces the power to 106 volts. Older refrigerators are the most overpowered and, thus, save the most energy with a GreenPlug. Refrigerators less than two years old are already energy-saving that a GreenPlug actually makes them waste electricity. The higher the voltage, the larger the difference a GreenPlug makes. Higher power costs shorten the payback time. The population-weighted national average is 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. But some residents in Washington State pay 1.5 cents. Some in Alaska pay 41.6 cents. Then come highly individual household differences like the number of children or refrigerator -opening age. All in all, the GreenPlug should save the average consumer 20 a year. Although the GreenPlug lowered the voltage as it was designed to do,Consumer Reports, an influential magazine, questioned how quickly---if ever---electricity savings due to the plug would repay its cost. People would be better off buying a new, high-efficiency refrigerator, the magazine... Question: We can infer from the passage that the author _ .

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"While the suggested answer does provide information on the popularity and prevalence of egg rolls in American Chinese food, it does not directly address the main question of who invented egg rolls. Therefore, I would not recommend validating this answer as it is off-topic and not explicitly providing the information requested. To provide a more accurate and detailed response to the question \\"Who invented egg rolls\\": The exact origins of egg rolls are uncertain, though they are commonly believed to have evolved from the Chinese dish called \\"spring rolls.\\" Spring rolls have been a popular dish in China for centuries, particularly in the Guangdong province. They are typically filled with vegetables and occasionally meat, then wrapped in a thin dough and fried or baked. The transformation of spring rolls into egg rolls occurred when Chinese immigrants came to the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries. To adapt to local ingredients and preferences, these Chinese cooks modified the original spring roll recipe by using a wheat flour-based wrapper instead of the traditional rice paper and incorporating a variety of fillings, such as cabbage, bean sprouts, and various meats. This resulted in a new creation called the \\"egg roll.\\" Despite these modifications, the exact person who invented the egg roll remains unknown. The dish was popularized in American Chinese restaurants starting in the early 20th century and has continued to gain widespread acclaim for its crispy texture and delectable combination of ingredients. In conclusion, although we cannot credit the invention of egg rolls to a specific individual, they were developed by early Chinese immigrants in the United States who adapted the traditional spring roll recipe to cater to Western palates. The dish has since become a staple in American Chinese cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Review: If this was the film that was playing, I think I would give that walk a go. This has to be the worst film that Jodie Foster has ever done, and not because her acting was poor. On the contrary, she was fine for the role; however, the writing and plot were terribly formulaic. From the second of the aforementioned quote it was evident to see where the film was headed, and it did not derail from the predestined outcome. While the premise was frightening, the thriller aspect of this film just did not convey. In fact, it came across flat out hokey in several spots. I adore both Foster and Sarsgaard, but how many times has she played a victimized overprotective mother, exactly? Often enough that she should have it down by now--and she does. Sarsgaard, though, seemed bored with his lines, all but delivering them between yawns. The only real star in this film was the six year old daughter, played by Marlene Lawston.

Question: How does Optimus disable the Space Bridge? Title: Transformers: Dark of the Moon Movie plot: During the final days of the war that devastated the planet Cybertron, a spacecraft known as The Ark attempted to escape. Piloted by the great Autobot leader named Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), the ship was said to contain special items that could help the Autobots win the war over the Decepticons. However, the ship was hit by enemy missiles, and the ship and its crew were lost into the far reaches of space.In 1961, the crash of the Ark on the moon is detected by NASA. Fearing that the Russians may beat them to finding out what this unidentified object is, President John F Kennedy pushes for NASA to land men on the moon to investigate. 8 years later, in 1969, Apollo 11 lands on the moon, and astronauts Neil Armstrong (Don Jeanes) and Buzz Aldrin (Cory Tucker) secretly explore the craft. They return with samples and pictures, and future moon missions bring back more information, before the manned moon missions are cancelled.In the present day, The Autobots are still working with the NEST Team to track down Decepticons loose on the planet, as well as anything unusual.

Lennox leads a team along with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) into the radioactive site. Inside the plant, Prime discovers a fuel cell from the Ark, and something even more shocking: the Decepticon Shockwave (Frank Welker) and a giant drilling robot at his command. After a short fight, Shockwave and the driller retreat. During the battle, a Decepticon assassin, Laserbeak (Keith Szarabajka), ambushes Vokshod kills him.Eventually, Prime and the other Autobots return to NEST's headquarters.

First, let's recall that any number multiplied by 0 is equal to 0. In this case, the term 0*x can be simplified to 0 as: 0*x = 0 Now, we are left with a new equation: 7*x + 0 = 0 We can further simplify it by eliminating the \\"+ 0\\" term from the equation, because adding 0 to a number doesn't change its value. Therefore, our simplified equation is: 7*x = 0 Now, to solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: 7*x / 7 = 0 / 7 x = 0 So the solution for the equation 7*x + 0*x = 0 is x = 0.

Summarize: The biggest risk of a Zika infection is not the infection, it is the potential complications that can develop as a result of the infection. Although complications only develop in a small minority of people, they can be severe. The two main complications that are suspected to be linked to the Zika virus are: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which is a neurological condition that can lead to potential paralysis. Microcephaly, which is a birth defect that develops when women who are pregnant become infected with Zika. Infants born with microcephaly have an abnormally small head and may have developmental delays as well. Some infants may even die as a result of this birth defect. GBS has been linked as a potential complication of the Zika virus, but there is not yet a proven link between the two. Still, it is important to know the signs and symptoms of GBS if you have Zika. GBS is an autoimmune disorder that may occur following a viral infection such as Zika. It affects your nervous system by damaging the nerve coverings. Symptoms include: Numbness in the lower extremities such as the feet, lower legs, and hands Difficulty moving Numbness and/or paralysis that gradually moves upwards Difficult breathing if the paralysis moves to the chest area Microcephaly in newborns has also been linked to the Zika infection in pregnant women (who then pass it on to their fetus in the womb). Microcephaly refers to an abnormally small head. This condition can lead to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and, in severe cases, it may even lead to death. When your baby is born, the doctors will take routine measurements of head circumference (both at birth, as well as at progressive intervals throughout your baby's growth). It is through abnormally small head circumference measurements that a doctor may diagnose your baby with microcephaly. Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference of less than 42cm at full growth. Doctors can use age-based growth charts to determine whether your baby's head circumference fits into the normal range at each developmental stage. If your baby is diagnosed microcephaly, it may be a sign that you have recently been infected with the Zika virus. However, GBS is treatable, so see a doctor as soon as possible if you think you have GBS. Microcephaly cannot be treated, but there are support strategies that may help your child reach as many developmental milestones as possible.","completion":"The primary risk of a Zika infection lies in the possible complications that may arise, although they only affect a small percentage of people.

Haunting portrait of Andy Warhol goes on display By contrast, Neel's painting shows him posing with a corset around his stomach, which he wore to appear slimmer. Neel, whose career lasted from the 1920s until her death in 1984, was renowned for delving into the inner psychology of her sitters and for being an astute, and sometimes brutal, observer of people. Usually surrounded by celebrity friends and hangers-on from his Factory studio, Warhol, who was in his early 40s when the portrait was painted, is depicted sitting alone on a bare couch in Neel's New York studio. The painting is one of more than 60 of Neel's works that will go on show from July 8 at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, which is staging Alice Neel: Painted Truths, the first major retrospective of her work. Jeremy Lewison, the curator of the exhibition, said: \\"Warhol always put on an impenetrable persona but Neel was a persuasive woman. It is significant that he has his eyes shut, as he is trying to put up a barrier to the feelings of shame that he might have about his personal appearance, but Neel gets right to the heart of the subject. \\"Warhol always tried to present an outwardly perfect, passive exterior, but here she penetrates through that, painting him as grotesque and imperfect and more like he really was.\\" Andrew Neel, the artist's grandson, said that Neel was \\"an expert\\" at capturing the true spirit of her sitters. He said: \\"The Warhol is an astounding portrait, depicting him like a sacrificial lamb to the machine of celebrity pop culture. \\"It also shows that behind his veneer of fame, genius and money was a very isolated, sensitive and sad man, who was less enigmatic and more human than he ever let on.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A haunting portrait of Andy Warhol by Alice Neel, renowned for uncovering the inner psychology of her subjects, reveals a vulnerable side of the artist as he sits alone on a couch, wearing a corset.

Review: In my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from \\"Only the Brave\\" to \\"All About Lane\\". I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. Although, I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However, the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie. Sorry Lane, you are just not a film actor. Stick to what you're good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... Why weren't they cast for that role? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they were fighting German soldiers... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some actually fighting?

Question: suppose more adults become elderly happens, how will it affect LESS babies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. If more adults become elderly, it implies that the population is aging, and there will likely be a decline in birth rates as older individuals are generally past their child-bearing years. As a result, there will be fewer babies born to replace the older generation. This decrease in birth rates will cause less overall babies, but it has less direct effect on the transition between babies becoming infants or the learning experiences of children. The proportion of babies turning into infants and children learning skills will remain largely unaffected by the increase of elderly individuals in the population. The population dynamics might change, but the stages of human development will still follow the same pattern.

Another English language form established in literature is the Dales. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Was he an irascible individualist? What would this English-born author of The Rights of Man--and arguably the draughtsman of U.S. independence--have been like to meet? Convivial guru or pain in the backside? A new play in London sets out to tell Paine's story, but it never quite drills down into the humanity of the fellow, real or imaginary. The play, which is showing at the open-air Globe theater, is more a work of biographical history than imaginative drama. The character of brave, reckless, fight-picking Paine himself is distinctly undercooked. Onetime Norfolk staymaker Paine did not emigrate to the American colonies until he was 37. What drove him? If we sat down today with him over a beer, what would we make of the bloke? Was he a disrespectful hell-raiser who hated all authority? Given the way he warmed to George Washington, this seems unlikely. Was he funny, prone to moods, a womanizer, a talker, a natural hack journalist? Was he maybe even, well, unreasonable? Paine is back in fashion. Barack Obama quoted him at his presidential inauguration ceremony and now we have this play, \\"A New World.\\" It does not bother with the first 37 years of his life. Time constraints would make that impossible. As it is, the show lasts for three hours; any longer than that and the audience at the Globe would have started to protest. The theater is a re-creation of a Shakespeare-era playhouse and has remarkably uncomfortable seats. Furthermore, half the audience has to stand. It would have been good to show Paine as a young man. Were there incidents that molded his ideas? Was he always a free-thinker? Or was he pushed toward disenchantment by one particular injustice? No doubt such scenes were included in playwright Trevor Griffiths' original version of the story (the work has been 20 years in the making). That was five hours long. The edited play concentrates more on Paine's political campaigns than on his rebellion against organized religion (one anti-church line in the show won a cheer of support from an elderly woman in the audience). In addition to his printed polemics against British rule, Paine became involved in the French revolution. The second half of the production has him largely in Paris. He did not have a happy time with the Frenchies. He got on the wrong side of the revolutionary feuding and was imprisoned for more than 10 months in 1794. It is a lot to expect any dramatist to imagine the disenchantment and rage that the disowned prophet must have felt as he stewed in his Parisian gaol. Griffiths, a venerable old Leftie, seems more determined to pack in historical facts than dwell on Paine's personal dilemma. Historically, this was no doubt the more honorable option, but a little imaginative juice in these scenes would have made the play more watchable. Griffiths ends his play with a prediction that Paine's revolution will eventually reach Britain. Given his Marxist past, he presumably wants the British monarchy to be overthrown. Watching the story of Tom Paine, however, it struck me that if he came back to modern Britain he would be more likely to agitate against the modern, quasi-colonial power of the European Commission. As in mid-18th century America, there are here today irritating questions of taxation and representation and the imposition of rules by an absent landlord elite. In today's Blighty, some of us feel as resentful of Brussels as Benjamin Franklin and his associates did about London. It so happens that Norfolk, Paine's old county, is a strong area for right-wing \\"Eurosceptics\\" who want Britain to tell our European masters where to go. If Paine was alive today, might he not stay at home and join enthusiastically in this fight for independence?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? aimlessness","completion":"The sentiment of the single word \\"aimlessness\\" can be considered negative. However, it is essential to understand the context and emotions associated with this word, as sentiment analysis is majorly dependent on the context in which a word or phrase is used. Aimlessness refers to the lack of purpose, direction, or goals. It denotes a state where a person or entity does not have any clear objectives or aims, often leading to feelings of uncertainty, confusion, and in some cases, despair. These emotions and associated states are generally viewed as negative. The negativity of aimlessness arises from several factors, such as: 1. Inability to make progress: Without a clear purpose or direction, it's difficult for individuals or groups to make advancements, be it professionally, academically, or personally. 2. Reduced motivation: Aimlessness can lead to a lack of motivation since there are no clear objectives to work towards. This can impact productivity and create depressive feelings. 3. Wasted resources: In the case of organizations, a lack of direction can lead to inefficiencies and wasted resources, which are often viewed as unfavorable. 4. Hindered personal growth and self-awareness: For individuals, experiencing aimlessness can impede personal growth and self-awareness development, which are essential for overall well-being and a sense of fulfillment. 5. Emotional distress: Prolonged periods of aimlessness can result in emotional distress, including feelings of unhappiness, dissatisfaction, or even anxiety and depression. In general, while the word \\"aimlessness\\" is not explicitly a positive or negative term on its own, the emotional and situational context it represents is often associated with negative feelings, states, and outcomes. Therefore, we can consider the sentiment of the word \\"aimlessness\\" to be negative without additional context. However, it is crucial to have a full understanding of the context in which it's being used to determine how it contributes to the overall sentiment of a sentence or text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important to give a bit more context regarding Domagk and his accomplishment for a more detailed answer: Gerhard Domagk was a German pathologist and bacteriologist who made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of medicine. In 1932, Domagk discovered that a chemical compound called Prontosil, which was a red dye, had powerful antibacterial effects and could be effective in treating streptococcus infections. This marked the emergence of the first commercially available, synthetic antibacterial drug, which ultimately led to the development of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. Domagk's discovery was of immense importance, as it revolutionized the way bacterial infections were treated and opened the door to the modern era of antibiotics. As a result, for his contribution to the field of medicine, Domagk was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939. The Nobel Prize is a highly esteemed international award that recognizes individuals for their outstanding achievements and contributions in various fields, including medicine.

Hilbert's seventh problem is one of the 23 famous mathematical problems posed by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900 at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. These problems served to guide mathematicians for much of the 20th century, and many of them are still actively being researched today. The seventh problem specifically deals with transcendental numbers, which are numbers that are not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. In other words, a transcendental number is a number that is not an algebraic number. Some examples of transcendental numbers include π (pi) and e. The problem can be formulated as follows: Given two algebraic numbers a and q (where a ≠ 0,1 and q is an irrational number), is the number a^q (a raised to the power of q) always transcendental? The British mathematician Alan Baker made significant progress towards solving the Hilbert's seventh problem in the 1960s. Baker's work focused on what is now known as the linear forms in logarithms, a method that had been previously utilized by the French mathematician Charles Hermite and the German mathematician Carl Siegel. In 1966, Baker published a groundbreaking paper that proved a theorem that would later become the foundation for answering the seventh problem. Baker's theorem states that any linear form in logarithms of algebraic numbers has a transcendental value, provided that it is not 0. This theorem essentially gives an upper bound on how well a non-zero algebraic linear form can approximate a transcendental value. By using this theorem and applying it to a broad class of numbers, Baker was ultimately able to prove that a^q is indeed transcendental when both a and q are algebraic, and a ≠ 0,1. This groundbreaking result resolved the open question of transcendence on the class of numbers described by the seventh problem. For this significant contribution to the field of mathematics, Alan Baker was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970, which is considered one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics. His work continues to be foundational in number theory, particularly in the study and understanding of transcendental numbers and Diophantine equations."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -23 = -3t - 26 for the variable t, we need to isolate t. We follow the principles of algebra in order to do this. Here are the steps: 1. Firstly, let's try to take all constants terms to one side of the equation. Now, by adding 26 to both sides, we get an equation without any constant term on the right side. It will look like -23 + 26 = -3t - 26 +26. Simplified, that's 3 = -3t. 2. Once we have it simplified, our objective is to get t by itself. To isolate t, we should divide each side of the equation by -3. It will look like 3/-3 = -3t/-3. Simplified to -1 = t. So the solution to this equation -23 = -3t - 26 is t = -1. This means if we substitute t = -1 into the original equation, we should get the true statement. If we check it, -23 = -3*(-1) - 26 = 3 - 26 = -23, so -23 = -23, confirming that t = -1 is indeed the correct solution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to ask a demon to possess an item (e.g., a painting or a doll)? If so, how? Is it possible for an animal to be possessed by a demon? Are there any reports of this happening? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? A). no; B). yes;","completion":"A) Is it possible to ask a demon to possess an item (e.g., a painting or a doll)? If so, how? The idea of demons possessing items comes from folklore, mythology, and religious beliefs rather than scientifically verifiable evidence. Belief in demons varies across cultures and religions, with various theories on how they interact with the physical world. While there is a longstanding history of stories describing instances of inanimate objects and places becoming haunted or possessed, it is crucial to note that these accounts are anecdotal and largely based on personal beliefs. For those who entertain the possibility of a demon possessing an item, there are several methods believed to encourage or compel a demon to possess an object. These methods typically involve ritualistic practices and might include: 1. Invocation or summoning: This is the process of calling upon a specific demon to request possession of an item. It often involves rituals, incantations, and the use of symbolism associated with the demon. 2. Creating a suitable vessel: Some believe that in order to attract a demon, an object must be made receptive or appealing to the entity. This may involve creating a vessel containing symbolism, engravings, or materials that match the demon's attributes. 3. Offerings and sacrifice: In some belief systems, offering sacrifices to a demon can be seen as a form of appeasement or invitation, essentially welcoming the entity to possess an object. 4. Using cursed or haunted objects: Introducing an object believed to be already cursed or containing demonic energy to the desired item can be seen as a way of transferring the demonic presence. It is important to remember that these practices are based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, with no scientific evidence to validate them. B) Is it possible for an animal to be possessed by a demon? Are there any reports of this happening? In the context of folklore, mythology, and religious beliefs, it is possible for animals to be thought of as 'possessed' by a demon, though this concept is also not scientifically verifiable. Reports of animals supposedly possessed by demons can be found in various religious texts and historical accounts. For instance, the Bible references a case where Jesus exorcized demons from a person and allowed them to enter a herd of pigs, which then drowned in the sea (Mark 5:1-20). In various cultural myths and stories, animals have been linked to demonic or supernatural forces. Animals such as black cats, wolves, and ravens have often been considered as symbols or manifestations of demonic entities. However, these beliefs are rooted in folklore and superstition, rather than empirical evidence. Throughout history, there have been anecdotal reports of animals deemed to be \\"possessed\\" or under the influence of evil spirits. These cases often involve unusual or aggressive behavior from animals that have chosen to interpret these events as demonic possession rather than looking for rational explanations. Modern understanding of animal behavior and psychology has minimized the likelihood of attributing strange animal actions to demonic possession. However, some individuals and groups still adhere to these traditional beliefs. To answer the multi-choice problem: A) No, these questions are not the same. They address different aspects of the concept of demonic possession. The first question pertains to the possibility of a demon possessing an item, while the second concerns the possibility of an animal experiencing possession. Although both subjects involve the idea of demonic possession, they explore different targets of possession and are not the same question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Paragraph: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.

The plan for was hatched by Jaan Anvelt and Karl Rimm. The latter was a veteran of the Russian Civil War. The plan envisaged the main attack aimed at Tallinn, with subsequent coups in Tartu, Narva, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Kunda, and Kohila. The revolt was supposed to start at 5:15 a.m. The 279 communists, mostly infiltrated from the Soviet Union, were armed with 5 Thompson light machine guns, 55 rifles, 65 hand grenades, 8 explosive devices and 150 pistols. It was mistakenly expected that the workers and soldiers would join the insurgency and would seize power in the capital together. The plan called for the establishment of an Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and of a \\"working people's government\\". Most of the schemes were spoiled by the Trial of the 149 in November 1924, which eliminated many potential communist organisers.

Locally, this period, called the \\"manor din\\" by the Assamese and \\"Chahi-Taret Khuntakpa\\" (seven years of devastation) in Meitei, is remembered with horror. It was the climactic period of the 600-year history of the Assamese kingdom. The sharp drop in population due both to depredations as well emigrations left the erstwhile kingdom in shambles. The British, who were earlier reluctant to colonise Assam, came into direct contact with a belligerent Burmese occupying force. Following the First Anglo-Burmese War they annexed not just Assam but also Burma. - Borgohain (Ahom language: \\"Chao Thao Lung\\") was the second of the two original counsellors in the Ahom kingdom. He was selected by the Ahom king from members of the Ahom nobility (\\"Satgharia Ahom\\"), who was not eligible for the position of Ahom kingship. The other original counsellor is the Burhagohain. Both the positions existed from the time of the first Ahom king, Sukaphaa. The Borgohain administered the region south of the Dikhow river to Koliabor. - Buragohain ( Ahom language : Chao Phrang Mong ) was the first of the two original counsellors in the Ahom kingdom . He was selected by the Ahom king from members of the Ahom nobility ( Satgharia Ahom ) , who was not eligible for the position of Ahom kingship . The other original counsellor is the Borgohain . Both the positions existed from the time of the first Ahom king , Sukaphaa . The Burhagohain administered the region north of the Dikhow river up to Sadia . - The East India Company (EIC), also known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) or the British East India Company and informally as John Company, was an English and later British joint-stock company, which was formed to pursue trade with the East Indies but ended up trading mainly with the Indian subcontinent and Qing China. - Assam (; \\"Ôxôm\\" ; \\"Asam\\"; \\"Âshám\\" ) is a state in northeastern India. Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra Valley and the Barak Valley along with the Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts with an area of . Assam, along with Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, and Meghalaya, is one of the \\"Seven Sister States\\". Geographically, Assam and these states are connected to the rest of India via a strip of land in West Bengal called the Siliguri Corridor or \\"Chicken's Neck\\". Assam shares an international border with Bhutan and Bangladesh; and its culture, people and climate are similar to those of South-East Asia comprising the elements in Indias Look East policy. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - The Treaty of Yandabo was the peace treaty that ended the First Anglo-Burmese War. The treaty was signed on 24February 1826, nearly two years after the war formally broke out on 5March 1824, by General Sir Archibald Campbell on the British side, and the Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side. With the British army at Yandabo village, only from the capital Ava, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms without discussion. - The First Anglo-Burmese War, also known as the First Burma War, (5 March 1824 24 February 1826) was the first of three wars fought between the British and Burmese empires in the 19th century. The war, which began primarily over the control of Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese were also forced to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and sign a commercial treaty. - The Ahom language is a nearly extinct Tai language spoken by the Ahom people who ruled the Brahmaputra river valley in the present day Indian state of Assam between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The language is classified in a Northwestern subgrouping of Southwestern Tai owing to close affinities with Shan, Khamti and, more distantly, Thai. As the Ahom rulers of the area assimilated to the more numerous Assamese, the Indo-Aryan Assamese language gradually replaced Ahom as a spoken language, a process which became complete during the 19th century. As of 2000, Ahom was only known by approximately 200 priests of the traditional Ahom religion and only used for ceremonial or ritualistic purposes. - Northeast India is the eastern-most region of India. It comprises of the contiguous Seven Sister States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), and the Himalayan state of Sikkim. The Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal, with a width of , connects the North Eastern region with East India. The region shares more than of international border (about 90 per cent of its entire border area) with China (southern Tibet) in the north, Myanmar in the east, Bangladesh in the southwest, and Bhutan to the northwest. - The Moamoria rebellion (17691806) was the 18th century conflict between the Morans, adherents of the Moamara Sattra, and the Ahom kings. This led to widespread popular discontent against the Ahom king and the nobles and to two periods in which the Ahom king lost control of the capital. Retaking the capital was accompanied by a massacre of subjects, leading to a steep depopulation of large tracts. The Ahom king failed to retake the entire kingdom, a portion in the north-east, Bengmara, became virtually independent. - \\"Genealogically, Assamese belongs to the group of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages\\" Assamese, Asamiya or Ôxômiya (Assamese: , \\"\\") is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in the state of Assam, where it is an official language. The easternmost of the Indo-Aryan languages, it is spoken by over 13 million native speakers, and serves as a \\"lingua franca\\" in the region. It is also spoken in parts of Arunachal Pradesh and other northeast Indian states. Nagamese, an Assamese-based Creole language is widely used in Nagaland and parts of Assam. Nefamese is an Assamese-based pidgin used in Arunachal Pradesh. Small pockets of Assamese speakers can be found in Bangladesh. In the past, it was the court language of the Ahom kingdom from the 17th century. - The Ahom kingdom (12281826, also called \\"Kingdom of Assam\\") was a kingdom in the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam, India that maintained its sovereignty for nearly 600 years and successfully resisted Mughal expansion in Northeast India. Established by Sukaphaa, a Tai prince from Mong Mao, it began as a mong in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra based on wet rice agriculture. It expanded suddenly under Suhungmung in the 16th century and became multi-ethnic in character, casting a profound effect on the political and social life in the entire Brahmaputra valley. The kingdom became weaker with the rise of the Moamoria rebellion, and subsequently fell to repeated Burmese invasions of Assam. With the defeat of the Burmese after the First Anglo-Burmese War and the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826, control of the kingdom passed into East India Company hands. - Mong Mao, Möngmao or \\"Mao kingdom\\" (\\"Mong\\" is the etymological equivalent of Thai \\"Mueang\\", meaning nation) was an ethnically Dai state that controlled several smaller Tai states or chieftainships along the frontier of what is now Myanmar and China in the Dehong region of Yunnan with a capital near the modern-day border town of Ruili. The name of the main river in this region is the Nam Mao, also known as the Shweli River. - Suhungmung (reign 14971539) (Swarganarayan, Dihingia Raja) (Assamese: ) was one of the most important Ahom kings, who ruled at the cusp of Assam's medieval history. His reign broke from the early Ahom rule and established a multi-ethnic polity in his kingdom. Under him the Ahom Kingdom expanded greatly for the first time since Sukaphaa, at the cost of the Sutiya and the Kachari kingdoms. He also successfully defended his kingdom against the first Muslim invasions under Turbak Khan. During his time, the Khen dynasty collapsed and the Koch dynasty ascended in the Kamata kingdom. His general, Tonkham, pursued the Muslims up to the Karatoya river, the western boundary of the erstwhile Kamarupa Kingdom, the farthest west an Ahom king had ventured in its entire six hundred years of rule. - The Ahom (Pron: , , people of Assam) are the descendants of the ethnic Tai people that accompanied the Tai prince into the Brahmaputra valley in 1228 and ruled the area for six centuries. Sukaphaa and his followers established the Ahom kingdom (12281826) and the Ahom dynasty ruled and expanded the kingdom until the British gained control of the region through the Treaty of Yandabo upon winning the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1826.

The establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1480, and of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the Governor-Captain General as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown, after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination. As a result, from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10% of the total earnings of the Crown of Castille, including the Americas, well over its economic relevance. Like the rest of Spain, the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580, when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands, France and England hampered Galicia's Atlantic commerce, which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines, wood, and some cattle and wine. In spite of these wars, which exports did Galicia's Atlantic trade consist of?","completion":"Galicia's Atlantic trade consisted of exporting sardines, wood, some cattle, and wine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A black dress mannequin, with a wooden leg stand, positioned next to a suitcase, and a female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, in a crowded city square.\\" if \\"The people are outside.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"A black dress mannequin, with a wooden leg stand, positioned next to a suitcase, and a female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, in a crowded city square\\" when given the premise, \\"The people are outside.\\" If the people are outside, it is logical that they might be gathered at a common, open-air location such as a city square. City squares are hubs for various human activities and gatherings due to their central location and accessibility. A scenario taking place in a crowded city square could entail numerous events, performances, and people, as well as objects on display, such as the black dress mannequin in this particular situation. A black dress mannequin could be present in the city square for multiple reasons. It could be part of an outdoor marketing campaign by a nearby clothing store, an art installation, or simply a mobile retail stand with a vendor selling dresses on-the-go. Since it is positioned next to a suitcase, the mannequin may be part of a temporary or mobile setup. The suitcase could hold additional merchandise or materials required for setting up, packing up, or moving the mannequin between locations. The wooden leg stand mentioned in the scene serves a functional purpose. It provides support for the mannequin, ensuring it remains stable and does not topple over due to wind, human interference, or any other factors. A wooden leg stand is a durable, yet lightweight option for outdoor use, making it a suitable choice for an outdoor setting such as a city square. The female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, may be an average passer-by or a visitor taking a break from her daily tasks. She could be a tourist, a local resident, or an employee on her lunch break. By including a person in the scene, the description paints a more complete and dynamic picture of a typical city square bustling with people and activity. In conclusion, the description of \\"A black dress mannequin, with a wooden leg stand, positioned next to a suitcase, and a female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, in a crowded city square\\" can be inferred from \\"The people are outside\\" by taking into account the common characteristics of city squares, which include diverse people, activities, and items on display.

Sentence 2: One of the most important towns of Roman Provence lies at the base of the western mountains of the region. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences discuss the notion of an important town of Roman Provence, the information alluded to in both does not share the same alignment. The first sentence provides a precise geographical direction and distance from a certain point (Orange) to reach the town along a specific route (D975). It clearly indicates that the town is located 30 km northeast of Orange. Contrastingly, the second sentence mentions only that the town is situated at the base of the western mountains of the region, without specifying any direct relation to 'Orange' or the route 'D975'. The description conveyed in each sentence does not inherently support or confirm the other. Each sentence contains distinct geographical details about the location of the town, and neither of these details can be inferred solely based on the information from the other sentence. Thus, the assertion presented in the second sentence can't be definitively drawn from the information in the first one. To establish if the second sentence is definitively entailed by the first, it would, for example, need to say something like: \\"This town, lying 30 km northeast of Orange along the D975, is one of the most important towns of Roman Provence.\\" This way it's clear that the positional details given are uniformly applicable for the mentioned town in Roman Provence, thereby connecting and confirming the information in both sentences.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency.

Summarize this article: Search engines are good way to find content, discover websites, check up on news and do your shopping online. But one day soon they may be so much more than this, and may even end up saving your life. According to Microsoft researchers, search engines have the potential of observing and warning you of disease and physical illness, based on your search history. Perhaps the most impressive such example, is when Microsoft’s Bing was able to infer that some of its users had pancreatic cancer, even before they were diagnosed. Dr. Eric Horvitz, one of Microsoft’s researchers leading the project, explained: We asked ourselves ‘If we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that something’s going on?’[...] I think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data. We’re hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation. This achievement has now been published in a research paper in The Journal of Oncology Practice, detailing how Bing could parse anonymized data and find clear search patterns for those suffering of pancreatic cancer. Based on the order, frequency and symptoms they were searching for Bing could determine which users were experiencing cancer-related symptoms, which queries were only prompted by curiosity or anxiety rather than an actual ailment, and which users were actually suffering from pancreatic cancer. As Dr Horvitz hinted at, this isn’t the first time that big data and search engine queries have been used for medical research. A few years ago Google tried to track the spread of the flu virus across the US based on search queries. There’s also the famous case where a big retailer discovered a young woman was pregnant before her family did, based on her changing shopping habits. But while Google’s attempt to use its search engine to track the flu turned out to be very inexact, Microsoft’s approach in this case seems to be a very robust one, with researchers being able to identify 5% to 15% of pancreatic cancer cases, with only one false positive per 100,000 cases. Of course, this was a limited trial of the technology and algorithms involved; more of a proof of concept than anything else. But its results were encouraging and if they can be reproduced, perhaps to even greater accuracy, we might soon see our search engines offering health services. One of Microsoft’s researchers even gave a tantalizing clue on the direction they want to head towards when he said “What might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day?”. He was referring to Microsoft’s own digital assistant powered by Bing, and the company’s already public efforts in utilizing personal data and machine learning to give health suggestions in its MS Health platform. Source: Journal of Oncology Practice Via: NYT ||||| Abstract Introduction: People’s online activities can yield clues about their emerging health conditions. We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The methods used statistical analyses of large-scale anonymized search logs considering the symptom queries from millions of people, with the potential application of warning individual searchers about the value of seeking attention from health care professionals. Methods: We identified searchers in logs of online search activity who issued special queries that are suggestive of a recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs. Results: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed specifically that we can identify 5% to 15% of cases, while preserving extremely low false-positive rates (0.00001 to 0.0001). ||||| Summary:","completion":"A research paper in The Journal of Oncology Practice has detailed how Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, was able to determine from anonymised data which users were experiencing cancer-related symptoms - and even those suffering from pancreatic cancer - based on the order and frequency of search terms.

Answer the following question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had. Question: A technician came to the house: Options: - after a bulb stopped lighting - when i worked on a project - around dinner time - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"- after a bulb stopped lighting"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Who directed the 2012 film 'Django Unchained'?","completion":"The 2012 film 'Django Unchained' was directed by Quentin Tarantino, an American filmmaker, screenwriter, and actor. Quentin Tarantino is widely regarded as one of the most influential directors of his generation, known for his distinctive style, sharp dialogue, and unique blend of genres in his movies. Born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino developed a love for movies at a young age. He later worked at a video store called Video Archives, where he was able to further fuel his passion for cinema, watching countless films and getting inspiration for his own career. Tarantino's directorial debut came in 1992 with the release of 'Reservoir Dogs,' which established his unique style and set the foundation for his successful career. He followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction' in 1994, which went on to become a massive hit and received numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Over the years, Tarantino has directed several other acclaimed movies, such as 'Jackie Brown' (1997), the 'Kill Bill' series (2003 and 2004), 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009), and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' (2019). 'Django Unchained,' released in 2012, was Quentin Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western film genre. The film stars Jamie Foxx as Django, a freed slave who embarks on a mission to rescue his enslaved wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (played by Kerry Washington), from a brutal plantation owner, Calvin Candie (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio). Django is aided by a German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz), who offers to help him in his quest in exchange for Django's assistance in capturing wanted criminals. The film is rich with Tarantino's trademark style, including intense and often violent scenes, sharp and witty dialogue, and a unique blend of dark humor and drama. 'Django Unchained' gained critical acclaim and performed exceptionally well at the box office. It received several nominations and awards, including five Academy Award nominations, with Christoph Waltz winning the Best Supporting Actor accolade. Overall, 'Django Unchained' serves as a stellar example of Quentin Tarantino's masterful storytelling and directing abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Angola , officially the Republic of Angola ( ; Kikongo, Kimbundu and Umbundu: \\"Repubilika ya Ngola\\"), is a country in Southern Africa. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa and is bordered by Namibia to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to west. The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda. Although its territory has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, what is now the modern country of Angola was influenced by Portuguese colonisation, which began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established beginning in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a Portuguese colony, Angola did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the Kwanyama and the Mbunda. Independence was achieved in 1975 under a Marxist-Leninist one party state, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba after a protracted anti-colonial struggle. However, the country soon descended into an even lengthier civil war that lasted until 2002. It has since become a relatively stable unitary presidential republic. 1.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music? from the following article ? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

News article: Dogs killed over unpaid fines By Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken California resident Gerilynn Aflleje was horrified when her 4-year-old Siberian Husky mix was killed by a local animal shelter over 180 in fees that she couldn't afford. Her dog, Chunk, had been dropped off at the Stockton shelter after getting lost in 2013, she later explained at a city council meeting. When Aflleje discovered her dog there less than a week later, she said the shelter demanded 180 within 24 hours for storing Chunk. Unemployed, Aflleje couldn't get the money in time. \\"We didn't only lose our pet. We lost a family member,\\" she said. In a number of cities across the country, animal control agencies are aggressively going after pet owners with big fines for small violations. Some hold people's pets until they settle their bills, even if it means they end up killed. Others leave the dogs alone but issue arrest warrants for owners who can't pay up. We didn't only lose our pet. We lost a family member.\\" The infractions can include failing to license a pet, owning a dog that barks a lot, or accidentally letting an animal get loose in the neighborhood. But the penalties are serious, often amounting to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. So are the consequences. When owners of seized or lost dogs can't afford to get their pets back, they relinquish their rights to the animal, which can result in a pet being euthanized. Meanwhile, a CNNMoney analysis of active warrants from a sampling of 15 cities and counties across the country found thousands of outstanding warrants for small pet-related offenses. Outraged pet owners and animal rights attorneys say these harsh tactics are all about generating money and unfairly impact low-income Americans. Chunk had been part of the Aflleje family since he was six weeks old. He was euthanized in 2013. But animal control agencies, which are run by local governments or contractors, say the fees and fines they collect help them to do their jobs and pay for things like storing animals. They also say their rules are meant to encourage responsible pet ownership and keep neighborhoods and animals safe. The ASPCA, an animal welfare non-profit, said enforcement efforts are \\"typically rooted in good intentions\\" but they can have \\"unintended consequences\\" that can lead to owners losing their pets. After coming under fire for alleged mistreatment of animals, Stockton has overhauled its shelter policies by lowering fees, facilitating more animal adoptions, and trying harder to reunite lost and seized pets with their owners -- all of which the shelter claims has resulted in a steep drop in euthanizations, from more than 75% of animals at the shelter in 2012 to 25% last year. It still faces a lawsuit filed by an animal rights group that alleges animal abuse, though the shelter says many of the allegations were already being addressed. But aggressive tactics are still common elsewhere. They are threatening people. They are intimidating people.\\" Indio, California resident Elizabeth Vasquez says that animal control officers seized her two dogs, Silver and Canelo, for being loose in the neighborhood and fined her 500. She claims they were secure in her backyard at the time. She used her grocery money to pay 200 -- enough to get Canelo back. But animal control killed Silver before she could scrape together enough cash to get the dog out, says Vasquez, who speaks only Spanish. Allan Drusys, chief veterinarian for Riverside County -- which took over Indio's animal services in 2013 -- said Vasquez's dogs were loose and picked up as part of a routine sweep for stray dogs and that a payment plan should have been made available to her. One pet owner was hit with this hefty fine for failing to sterilize, vaccinate, microchip and license three dogs. In some cases, dogs don't even have to leave the yard for animal control to come calling. Last year, Riverside County inspectors incited controversy for going door-to-door and giving out citations of up to 400 per dog in Indio's low-income and mainly Hispanic neighborhoods. In some cases, they cited people for failing to have their pets licensed, sterilized, vaccinated and microchipped without even seeing the animals. Riverside County told CNNMoney that this was part of its ongoing enforcement efforts across the county and residents could avoid paying the fines by fixing the violation within 30 days. While there are some low-cost options available for sterilization and other procedures, local advocates said waiting lists are often months long. They also railed against the agency for leaving wealthy, gated communities untouched. \\"They are threatening people. They are intimidating people,\\" said Kim Maguire-Hardee, a local activist who runs a low-cost spay and neuter clinic.\\"[But] if people have lawyers and speak English, they don't go there.\\" Drusys, who oversees the pet licensing program, says he takes \\"great exception to the accusation that we are picking on poor people.\\" Licensing revenues are projected to almost double in Riverside County in two years. \\"It's not our fault that we don't go to the gated communities -- we go there all the time, they refuse entry,\\" he said. Across Riverside County, many people are rushing to get their pets licensed. Licenses cost 16 a year for most dogs but jump to 100 for dogs that aren't spayed or neutered -- a procedure that can cost hundreds of dollars. Amid these aggressive enforcement efforts, Riverside projects that county licensing revenue will almost double from two years ago to nearly 1 million. But Drusys said the licensing program, which includes low-cost services like sterilization, is \\"not focused on revenue.\\" \\"It is focused on getting dogs and cats spayed and neutered,\\" he said. \\"Because if they're not born, they can't be impounded into the system.\\" Elsewhere, owners are being charged to keep their animals alive until they are given a chance to argue their pet's innocence. Colorado resident Caitlin McAdam's dogs, Jake and Lucy, were seized from her home two months ago after they were accused of killing a neighbor's cat. Even though no evidence was provided that linked her dogs to the incident, McAdam was told that they could be killed if she didn't pay 1,200 in upfront impound fees within 10 days. The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region, a contractor that handles animal control for the area, said fees are set by state law and the court determines how quickly a case gets heard. With the help of an attorney, McAdam moved her dogs to a private facility while they await trial. This costs her 250 a week. An initial hearing overseen by a judge was held in mid-February. And while her attorney recently learned that an autopsy of the cat found it unlikely that it was attacked by two dogs, McAdam is still awaiting a jury trial in April. At that point, she and her attorney plan to present proof of the dogs' innocence -- including multiple witnesses who were with the dogs when the alleged incident occurred. Until then, her family can only see their dogs during approved visits and will be spending thousands of dollars on storage fees and legal costs. To help cover these expenses, they've sold an old car, used a tax refund, borrowed money from friends and raised money through crowdfunding. Derrick was heartbroken when his dogs were seized by animal control. But if the dogs are found guilty they could be killed anyway. If found innocent, McAdam will still be out thousands of dollars. \\"We've had to come up with extra (money) that frankly we just don't have,\\" said McAdam, whose 9-year-old son Derrick has been traumatized by the incident. \\"It's hard -- it's definitely hard.\\" Mary Root was arrested after her Chihuahuas got loose and she couldn’t afford to pay the fines. Mary Root, an 82-year-old widow from Havre de Grace, Maryland, spent two days in jail last March after her neighbor complained to animal control that her Chihuahuas had gotten loose three times. Root was charged 525 for the incidents. Living on roughly 2,000 a month and already struggling to pay her property taxes, she couldn't afford the fines. But she was thankful nothing happened to her dogs. When she missed a court hearing about the violations -- which Root said she couldn't attend for medical reasons -- an arrest warrant was issued and she was put in jail. Locals rallied for support of Mary Root, who went to jail over unpaid pet fines. Root learned that she could either face more than a year in jail or owe 7,000 -- an amount that included the initial fines and new ones for missing the hearing. A Harford County spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment. Root was only able to get out of jail after a good Samaritan heard her story on the local news and bailed her out. A pro bono attorney helped her negotiate the 7,000 bill to around 500, which she paid with the help of her church and lawyer. \\"It's been a nightmare,\\" said Root, who lives alone. \\"I'm 82 and I'm just hanging in there -- that's why I value my little dogs.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Gerilynn Aflleje's Siberian Husky mix, Chunk, was killed by a local animal shelter over 180 in fees that she couldn't afford. 2.

The character soon became the second most popular Lantz/Universal character, behind Woody Woodpecker. - Popeye the Sailor Man is a cartoon fictional character created by Elzie Crisler Segar. The character first appeared in the daily King Features comic strip, Thimble Theatre, on January 17, 1929, and Popeye became the strip's title in later years; Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons. - Frederick Bean \\"Tex\\" Avery (February 26, 1908 August 26, 1980) was an American animator, cartoonist, voice actor and director, known for producing animated cartoons during the golden age of American animation. His most significant work was for the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, crucial in the evolution of Bugs Bunny, creating Daffy Duck, Droopy, and Screwy Squirrel, and developing Porky Pig and Chilly Willy (this last one for the Walter Lantz Studio) into the personas for which they are remembered. - Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character and one of the most famous \\"Looney Tunes\\" characters, and the \\"de facto\\" archenemy of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself). His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a \\"wabbit\\". Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \\"Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\\", as well as his trademark laughter. - Daffy Duck in Hollywood is a 1938 Merrie Melodies animated short starring Daffy Duck ( in his similar design from Daffy Duck & Egghead ) .

He was created in 1943 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio. Essentially the polar opposite of Avery's other famous MGM character, the loud and wacky Screwy Squirrel, Droopy moves slowly and lethargically, speaks in a jowly monotone voice, andthough hardly an imposing characteris shrewd enough to outwit his enemies. When finally roused to anger, often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him, Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing (\\"You know what? That makes me mad!\\"). - Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character; created in 1940 by Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros.

Summarize this article: FBI Director James Comey said he was worried about a spike in the murder rate in American cities. | Getty Comey increasingly worried about murder spike in cities FBI Director James Comey is again sounding the alarm about a surge in murders in several American cities and is publicly complaining that the problem isn't getting much national media attention because the victims are minorities who live in particular neighborhoods. \\"I was very worried about it last fall and I am in many ways more worried,\\" Comey told reporters during a question-and-answer session at FBI headquarters Wednesday. \\"The numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up faster than they were going up last year. And I worry very much it's a problem that most of America can drive around....I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.\\" Story Continued Below Comey said he was briefed Wednesday on quarterly murder statistics for about 40 major cities and most of them have seen increases. \\"From the Las Vegas strip, you can't tell that 60 people have been murdered in Las Vegas this year. From the Miracle Mile in Chicago, you can't hear the sounds of gunshots that have killed over 200 people this year,\\" the FBI chief said. \\"It's again happening in certain parts of the cities and the people dying are almost entirely black and Latino men and we can't drive around that problem.\\" Comey gently prodded the national media to devote more coverage to the issue. \\"It's being reported on at local levels, but in my view it's not getting the attention at the national level it deserves,\\" he said. Comey evoked the ire of some White House officials last fall when he publicly suggested that the surge in murders could be due to police stepping back from engagement with minority communities in the wake of numerous cell-phone videos depicting police abuse. Some Obama administration officials indicated at the time that there was no evidence of a widespread crime surge or that police had changed their tactics. The FBI chief has acknowledged that the surge in murders is perplexing in several respects, including the fact that some cities have not seen any uptick while others are experiencing a shocking level of violence. \\"Why does Dallas see a dramatic spike and Houston doesn't?...The map and the calendar makes no sense,\\" Comey said. \\"It's a complicated, hard issue, but the stakes couldn't be higher. A whole lot of people are dying. I don't want to drive around it.\\" Comey said the FBI is working with police in several cities to try to improve relationships between minority communities and police. The FBI director acknowledged he still has no hard proof that attention to police-involved shootings and other instances of alleged abuse has changed the policing dynamic. But he said he continues to hear that from officers informally. \\"What I'm talking about is sort of the viral video effect....Changes in the way police may be acting and in the way communities may be acting in terms of how much information they share with police could well be at the heart of this or could well be an important factor in this,\\" Comey said. \\"I think it is the potential effect of marginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers that is changing some cities. I continue to hear that privately.....I've heard it in lots of conversations privately with police leaders.\\" \\"I don't know for sure ... something has happened,\\" Comey added. Authors: ||||| FBI Director James Comey speaks in Detroit in April. (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP) WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey once again raised the prospect that sustained spikes in violent crime in many U.S. cities could be linked to a pull back by police who fear the scrutiny of a plethora of cellphone video trained on law enforcement actions across the country. Citing rising murder numbers in some of America's largest cities, including Chicago and Las Vegas, Comey said the phenomenon of \\"viral videos'' may be prompting changes in the way officers are policing their cities. \\"I was worried about it last fall,'' Comey told reporters at a Wednesday briefing, referring to continuing surges in violence. \\"And I am, in many ways, more worried now. ...The people dying are almost entirely black and Latino. I don't know what the answer is. But, holy cow, do we have a problem.'' And the director said that \\"changes in the way police may be acting ... could well be at the heart of this'' troubling trend. The director’s remarks echoed a similar assessment he provided during separate appearances last fall in Chicago, which put him at odds with some in law enforcement and the White House. At that time, White House spokesman Josh Earnest and Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that the available data did not support such a conclusion. The White House and Justice Department did not address Comey's remarks Wednesday. But Comey said he continues to hear from local law enforcement authorities who fear that officers have become less aggressive in carrying out their duties, if only marginally, out of concern that their actions will be captured on video and dissected publicly. While Comey could not absolutely attribute the crime spikes to less aggressive policing, he urged academics and others to examine the possible relationship. \\"It's a problem (violent crime) that most of America can drive around,'' the director said. \\"From the Las Vegas strip, you can't tell that more 60 people have been murdered in Las Vegas this year. From the Miracle Mile in Chicago, you can't hear the sounds of gun shots that have killed more than 200 people so far this year. \\"There is a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal things that suppress crime,'' the director said. Comey said he had become newly concerned about the issue after reviewing quarterly crime data collected by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a law enforcement group representing the nation's largest cities. Many of the more than 40 cities represented in the in the group's review, he said, were reporting problems with violence. Darrel Stephens, executive director of the chiefs' association, could not be immediately reached for comment. But Chuck Wexler, director of the law enforcement think tank Police Executive Research Forum, said police officials were scheduled to meet later this month in New York to discuss the possible causes of the scattered surges in violence. That meeting, Wexler said, would address the issue known as de-policing. \\"Why is crime going up in some cities and not in others? It is a question that police chiefs are asking,'' Wexler said.

But some dissenters said he was needlessly stirring up an unproven and divisive notion. “He ought to stick to what he knows,” James O. Pasco Jr., executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said in a telephone interview. The organization has more than 330,000 members. “He’s basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no proof,” Mr. Pasco said. Mr. Comey’s remarks were prompted by a private briefing he received on Wednesday about rising crime rates in more than 40 cities during the first quarter of 2016. He said the new statistics, which have not been made public, showed a significant jump in murder rates in many cities. The numbers rose even more quickly than last year, Mr. Comey said. In 2015, rising murder tallies in Washington, Baltimore, Milwaukee, St. Louis and other cities made national news. Video The two cities Mr. Comey singled out in the latest tallies were Las Vegas and Chicago. He said most of the murder victims were either black or Hispanic men, although F.B.I. officials declined to provide specific figures and said the data would likely be released later this week. In Chicago, where violence and police shootings have angered the city, officials say that as of April, murders were up 54 percent from last year, and shootings were up by 70 percent. Mr. Comey said that he could not fully explain the trend or the major differences from one city to the next.

He said that the spike in violent crime deserves more national attention from scholars, the media, and the public. “Something is happening,” he said. “A whole lot more people are dying this year than last year, and last year than the year before and I don’t know why for sure.” Asked about his past views on the “Ferguson effect” as a possible explanation, Mr. Comey said he rejected that particular term, but added that he continued to hear from police officials in private conversations that “lots and lots of police officers” are pulling back from aggressive confrontations with the public because of viral videos. He said that the phenomenon “could well be an important factor in this.” More than many of his predecessors at the F.B.I., Mr. Comey has not hesitated to use the prestige of his office to draw attention to difficult and sometimes unpopular issues involving race and crime. Last year, he gave an unusually candid speech at Georgetown University about the tense relationship between police and blacks, saying that minorities are scrutinized more closely than whites because of bias. In the talk, he cited a song from a Broadway musical called “Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist.” That won him praise from some advocates of minorities, but in the debate over the Ferguson effect, he has angered some minority leaders who say the real problem remains policing in their communities that, if anything, is too aggressive, and far short of passive. One reason for the sharp disagreement is that there is little reliable national data on the topic, even at the F.B.I. The F.B.I. has promised to build a database compiling police shootings and confrontations with members of the public, but Mr. Comey said that project was at least two years from completion. “That does frustrate me,” he said. |||||","completion":"FBI Director, James Comey, has expressed his concerns over a spike in murder rates in American cities, complaining that not enough national media attention is being given to the issue and believes it is a problem \\"that most of America can drive around.\\" Comey points out that the people dying are almost entirely black and Latino men, indicating that the rise in murders could be attributed to police stepping back from engagement in minority communities following numerous cell-phone videos showing police abuse.

However, he also mentioned that he is hearing through unofficial sources that the \\"viral video effect\\" is producing changes in the way police may be acting and in the way communities may be acting in terms of how much information they share with police."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I read this background article the other day: Common causes of heat exhaustion include:[1] Hot, sunny, humid weather Physical exertion, especially in hot, humid weather Due to impaired thermoregulation, elderly people and infants can get serious heat illness even at rest, if the weather outside is hot and humid, and they are not getting enough cool air. Some drugs, such as diuretics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, alcohol, ecstasy, and amphetamines can cause an increase in the risk of heat exhaustion.[2] Especially during physical exertion, risk factors for heat exhaustion include:[1] Wearing dark, padded, or insulated clothing; hats; and/or helmets (for example, football pads or turnout gear) Having a higher percentage of body fat Dehydration Fever Some medications, like beta blockers and antipsychotic medicines[2] I am facing a new situation today: Two groups of people were out in the sunny, humid weather of Illinois.

Bundan biraz sonra, Nijeryalı Nwankwo Kanu oradan geçti ve takım arkadaşı Sani Kaita'nın oyundan atılmasıyla ilgili kaçınılmaz soruyu sordu. Which language is this?","completion":"The language in question is Turkish. Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. The language has a strong structure of vowel harmony (much like Finnish and Hungarian) and agglutination, meaning that morphemes can be added to a root-word to alter its meaning and create a new word. In terms of the geographical location, it is primarily spoken in Turkey and Cyprus and has nearly 80 million speakers worldwide. You'll find Turkish-speaking communities in several countries due to migration, including Germany, the Netherlands, France, and the UK. It is also one of the official languages of Cyprus. Regarding the alphabet, Turkish uses a Latin-script based alphabet of 29 letters: 8 vowels and 21 consonants. It has been adapted from the Latin script after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1928, during a series of sweeping reforms initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Now, for some specifics about this language. Turkish is known for its SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order, although this is not strictly adhered to all the time - especially in spoken conversation. The Turkish Vocabulary is rich with synonyms, and it has a flexible and expressive grammar. Additionally, its rules of pronunciation are quite simple and clear compared to many other languages. However, Turkish can be challenging to learn for speakers of Indo-European languages due to its completely different grammar structure. Its agglutinative nature, vowel harmony rules, and lack of gendered nouns are among the factors that can make it difficult for some learners. The language also boasts an extensive system of honorifics, with different ways of speaking based on relationship, formality, and politeness. In addition to being spoken in its \\"pure\\" form, the Turkish language has dialects and accents that vary regionally. These regional varieties, while generally intelligible with standard Istanbul Turkish, have distinct phonological, syntactical, and lexical traits that can underscore the rich linguistic variety within the Turcophone sphere. To summarize, the language of the given text is Turkish, a rich and unique language belonging to the Turkic family, primarily spoken in Turkey and Cyprus, and known for its agglutinative structure and vowel harmony."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: If I tell you that Freezing causes ice to form, and ask you the question \\"what causes ice to form?\\", is the correct answer \\"liquid\\"?

Ca n't complain , really , but this means I ca n't afford to move out . SO . Answer the following question: why ca n't the person afford to move out ?","completion":"Based on the information provided, the person cannot afford to move out due to several reasons related to their education and financial circumstances. These reasons can be analyzed and elaborated upon to better understand the individual's situation. 1. Double majoring: The person has chosen to pursue a double major in their studies, meaning that they are completing the requirements for two different fields of study simultaneously. This decision not only extends the duration of their education, but it also likely increases their tuition fees and other related expenses. By taking on this additional academic challenge, the person may have reduced their available financial resources for other aspects of their life, such as living independently. 2. Extended time in school: Because the individual is double majoring, they have decided to spend a few more years in school rather than graduating in the winter. This prolonged period of education can limit the person's ability to earn a full-time salary, as they must focus on their studies and potentially balance part-time work rather than pursuing a career. As a result, their income may not be sufficient to cover the costs associated with moving out and living on their own. 3. Tuition fees and student loans: Higher education is often associated with significant tuition fees and other costs, such as textbooks, supplies, and transportation. In many cases, students rely on loans to finance their education, which can lead to substantial debt. This financial burden may make it difficult for the person to save money for a security deposit, rent, and other living expenses required to move out of their current living situation. 4. Opportunity cost: Although the individual mentions that they cannot complain about their choice to double major and extend their time in school, this decision may have had an opportunity cost. By investing more time and money into their education, the person may have forgone other financial opportunities that could have enabled them to move out, such as investing in savings or pursuing lucrative career opportunities earlier. 5. Inability to work full time: Balancing a double major workload may also mean that the person cannot commit to a full-time job. They may have to settle for part-time work or internships that do not provide enough income to support living independently. The need to focus on academic success and positioning themselves for a successful post-graduation career might force them to prioritize their education over the financial stability required to move out. 6. Economic factors and cost of living: Depending on the location, the cost of living can be quite high, making it challenging for individuals to secure affordable housing, especially while still in school. The person might be unable to move out due to these external factors, which are out of their control. In conclusion, the person cannot afford to move out primarily because they have chosen to extend their time in school and pursue a double major, which has limited their financial resources and income-generating potential. Factors such as tuition fees, student loans, the opportunity cost of their decision, and external economic conditions have contributed to their inability to move out and live independently at this stage in their life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, variously referred to as the Australian Parliament, the Commonwealth Parliament or the Federal Parliament, is the legislative branch of the government of Australia. It consists of three elements: the Queen of Australia, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General. The combination of two elected houses, in which the members of the Senate represent the six States and the two self-governing Territories while the members of the House represent electoral divisions according to population, is modelled on the United States Congress. Through both houses, however, there is a fused executive, drawn from the Westminster System. - The Australian Democrats was a centrist political party in Australia with a social-liberal ideology. The party was formed in 1977, a merger of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement, with former Liberal minister Don Chipp as its high-profile leader. Though never achieving a seat in the House of Representatives, the party had considerable influence in the Senate for the following thirty years. Its representation in the Parliament of Australia ended on 30 June 2008, after loss of its four remaining Senate seats at the 2007 general election. , the organisation had disintegrated and control was contested by two factions associated with two former parliamentarians. The party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission on 16 April 2015 due to the party's failure to demonstrate requisite 500 members to maintain registration. Even before its deregistration and since it became extinct as a parliamentary party anywhere in Australia, the party saw many of its prominent members defect to the Greens, including former federal party leaders Janet Powell and Andrew Bartlett and former NSW MLC Arthur Chesterfield-Evans. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - The single transferable vote (STV) is a voting system designed to achieve proportional representation through ranked voting in multi-seat organizations or constituencies (voting districts). Under STV, an elector (voter) has a single vote that is initially allocated to their most preferred candidate and, as the count proceeds and candidates are either elected or eliminated, is transferred to other candidates according to the voter's stated preferences, in proportion to any surplus or discarded votes. The exact method of reapportioning votes can vary (see Counting methods). - East Timor or Timor-Leste (Tetum: \\"Timór Lorosa'e\\"), officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a sovereign state in Maritime Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi). - The Australian Senate is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Australia, the lower house being the House of Representatives. The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Chapter I, Part II of the Australian Constitution. There are a total of 76 senators: 12 senators are elected from each of the six states (regardless of population) and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory). Senators are popularly elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation. - Andrew John Julian Bartlett (born 4 August 1964) is a former Australian politician. He was an Australian Democrats member of the Australian Senate from 1997 to 2008, representing the state of Queensland.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"propellers are on some airplanes primarily to give\\" is \\"protection from bird strikes\\", given that some airplanes use propellers to move? A:","completion":"I believe that the phrase \\"propellers are on some airplanes primarily to give\\" is looking for a reason as to why propellers are featured on certain aircraft. In this case, I would argue that the primary purpose of propellers on aircraft is not for protection from bird strikes, but rather to provide propulsion and forward movement for the airplane. Let me provide a detailed explanation. Propellers have been a part of aviation since the beginning, with one of the most famous examples being the Wright brothers' airplane, the Wright Flyer. Propellers are essentially rotating airfoils that convert rotational motion, typically generated from a piston engine or turboprop engine, into linear thrust. This thrust is the force that pushes the airplane forward, allowing it to overcome air resistance (drag) and achieve flight. Propellers have several advantages over jet engines, particularly in smaller, general aviation aircraft. They are generally more fuel-efficient at lower speeds and altitudes, quieter, and less complex in terms of maintenance. As a result, propellers can be found on a variety of aircraft, including small single-engine planes, regional turboprops, and some military transport aircraft. Now, coming to the question of whether propellers primarily serve as protection from bird strikes: Bird strikes are a serious concern for aviation safety. A bird strike occurs when an airplane and a bird collide during flight, potentially causing significant damage to the aircraft or its engines. While propellers have the potential to cause damage or kill birds that fly into them, it is not their primary function to serve as protection from bird strikes. In fact, both propeller-driven and jet-powered aircraft face risks from bird strikes. Jet engines are particularly vulnerable due to the potential for ingesting birds into the engine core, which can cause engine failure or damage. Propeller-driven aircraft can also suffer damage from bird strikes, with a propeller potentially being damaged or bent, which could lead to instability, vibration, and reduced performance. It should also be noted that aircraft designs employ several strategies to mitigate the risk of bird strikes, such as specially designed engine intakes, bird diversion tactics around airports, and even bird-scaring devices. However, these features are supplementary to the primary functions of their respective aircraft components (such as providing propulsion or lift). In conclusion, propellers are found on some airplanes primarily to provide thrust and propulsion, enabling them to achieve and maintain flight. The notion that propellers are designed primarily for protection from bird strikes is not accurate, as both propeller-driven and jet-powered aircraft face the risk of bird strikes, and various other strategies are employed to address this issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. But I can use this background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. What is an answer for this question: Would the objects be closer to or farther from each other in case A than in case B? Answer:","completion":"In order to determine whether the objects would be closer to or farther from each other in case A (charging by conduction) than in case B (charging by induction), let's first recap the essential differences between the two methods. 1. Charging by Conduction (Case A): - A charged object comes into direct contact with an uncharged object. - Electrons flow between the objects to equalize the charges. - Both objects end up with the same charge. 2. Charging by Induction (Case B): - A charged object is brought close to an uncharged object, but they do not touch. - The presence of the charged object causes the electrons in the uncharged object to redistribute their positions. - The previously uncharged object attains the opposite charge without direct contact with the charged object. With these key differences in mind, we can conclude that the objects would be closer to each other in Case A than in Case B. In Case A, charging by conduction requires direct contact between the objects, meaning they need to be close enough to touch each other. In contrast, Case B involved charging by induction, which does not necessitate physical contact between the objects – only that they be in close proximity to allow the charged object to influence the distribution of electrons in the uncharged object. So, in summary, the objects would be closer to each other in Case A (charging by conduction) than in Case B (charging by induction)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Warts typically go away with home treatment or on their own. If you’ve been treating your wart but it isn’t improving, talk to your doctor to find out if you need additional treatments. Your doctor may be able to give you a stronger treatment than what you can find in the store. They may treat your wart in their office and might even be able to remove it. Alternatively, your doctor might offer you a prescription-strength topical cream. Sometimes warts can develop on your hands and feet, which might make it hard for you to carry out your daily activities. If this happens, talk to your doctor about treatment options that can help your wart heal faster. Then, follow your doctor’s advice so you can get back to your normal activities. Medical treatments can help your wart heal a lot faster than they would with home treatment. Try not to worry, but this could be a sign that what you have is more serious than a wart.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rice Energy's Gas Deal Gives OPEC a Black Eye If you want to understand why OPEC is having such a hard time squeezing shale producers out of the energy market, look no further than Rice Energy's multi-dimensional, 2.7 billion acquisition of Vantage Energy. Yes, it's a natural-gas deal, not oil. But that isn't the point. The point is that a deal of this scale, requiring this much new money, for a commodity this beaten down, is getting done at all in the U.S. exploration and production sector. Gas has rallied recently, although 3 per million BTU counts as enough to get a high-five from bulls these days. 3, That's The Magic Number Natural gas prices have rallied, albeit from very low levels Note: Generic 1st-month natural gas futures contract. But the U.S. gas market is a patchwork of regions, with local pricing often markedly different from the benchmark Nymex futures price because of constraints on pipeline capacity. Such is the case in Appalachia, where Rice and Vantage have their core assets: Natural gas prices at the Dominion South Point hub in Pennsylvania have slipped back below 1 So sentiment overall is better than it was but hardly jubilant. Certainly, you might think a gas producer would have some problems going to investors and telling them it wants to raise more money selling new shares than it did at its IPO less than three years ago. But Rice seems to be handling it. To fund the deal, Rice is pulling multiple levers. Its selling almost 1.2 billion of new shares (including the greenshoe), which is more than it raised when the stock debuted in late 2013, according to Bloomberg data. It's issuing roughly another 1 billion to Vantage's private equity owners. All in all, the 85.1 million new shares are equal to a staggering 43 percent of the existing number outstanding. Increase in Rice Energy's Share Count to Fund This Deal In addition, Rice will immediately sell the pipeline assets that come as part of the package to its master limited partnership, Rice Midstream Partners, to cover 600 million of the cost. That money will come from a combination of the MLP using debt and selling new units or just handing some over to Rice. The seemingly endless appetite of U.S. capital markets is what has enabled the country's E&P firms to withstand OPEC's onslaught better than many expected heading into this crash. Despite (and because of) the crash, 2016 is a banner year for U.S. E&P stock offerings Note: Data for 2016 are year-to-date through September 27th. That isn't to say Rice is just riding a wave. It has managed rapid growth while keeping its borrowing in check -- a rare feat these days. Part of this is down to savvy use of futures: Rice's average realized gas price last year was 2.21 per million BTU before hedges but 3.18 -- 44 percent higher -- after. Indeed, one of the attractions of Vantage, other than its main acreage sitting neatly next to Rice's own, is its own hedge book. Roughly two-thirds of pro forma production next year is hedged. Rice's stock has been a star performer this year, despite the company selling another 561 million of stock in April to help fund another deal. The same goes for Rice Midstream, which has trounced the broader MLP sector. Rice's two securities have surged this year Note: Performance indexed to 100. So Rice is taking advantage of investors' generosity -- including Rice Midstream's current cost of equity below 4 percent -- and liquid futures markets to keep expanding. In the process, the deal also offers a way for Vantage's private equity owners to cash out and back into an established, listed stock rather than continue down the path of trying to IPO the company themselves. Is it an option open to everyone? No. Earlier this summer, I noted the club of E&P companies coming to the stock market to raise more money had shrunk somewhat compared to 2015. Equally, though, any company able to claim real estate in the Permian basin seems able to name their price. It's a trend that appears unsustainable if energy prices remain depressed and if interest rates should rise. But it's appeared unsustainable for quite some time already. And now along comes this Rice deal. OPEC may be showing some fatigue in its battle to recover market share. Until it finally beats the capital markets into submission, though, it should soldier on.

A miniature donkey, born with a deformed leg, is thriving after being fitted with one of the first prosthetic limbs to be created by equine surgeons. The young foal named Emma had her hind leg amputated at just two days old because it stopped her from standing. But she is now enjoying a new lease of life after vets at Auburn University, Alabama, managed to create a special artificial leg for her, similar to those used by Paralympic athletes. Scroll down for video. Miniature donkey Emma, pictured with her owner Cece Smith, proudly displaying her prosthesis limb which allows her to stand. The leg needs to be replaced every few months until Emma is fully grown, but at five months old, she is able to run around with the rest of her herd. She is now on her second prosthesis and experts predict she will need about seven different legs before she reaches adulthood. Dr Fred Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical Sciences and equine surgeon at the university, performed the procedure and is working with clinician Billy Fletcher from Hanger Clinic. The clinic is part of the same company which created a prosthetic tail for Winter, the amputee dolphin and star of the film ‘Dolphin Tale’, who lost her tail after she was caught in a crab trap off the coast of Florida. Thanks to the artificial limb Emma can run around and jump like the rest of the group. She was fitted with the pink prosthesis after surgeons amputated her severely deformed leg which stopped her from walking. Dolphin trainer Cammie Zodrow with Winter the dolphin, who was fitted with a prosthetic tail by the same company who fitted Emma the miniature donkey with an artificial limb. The two worked out a plan to allow Emma time to heal from the surgery and transition from her cast to the prosthesis. Dr. Caldwell said: ‘Once we proceeded with the surgery and amputated the. distal limb, he provided a small footplate to incorporate into the cast. to even out the length of her hind limbs so she could bear weight until. we could get the surgical site healed and have her fitted with a. prosthesis. ‘It has been a group effort on behalf of many caring individuals willing to go to great lengths to save her.’ Emma's case is providing a unique teaching opportunity for the clinicians involved, as the practice of using prostheses with large horses is relatively uncommon due to size and weight-bearing limitations. But because Emma is a miniature donkey, even as an adult she will only weigh approximately 350 pounds once fully grown. A team of doctors and surgeons from Auburn University, Alabama, carefully fit Emma with her latest prosthesis. The veterinary team are excited at Emma's progress since she was fitted with the prosthetuic limb - which could soon be an option for all horses. Dr Caldwell added: ‘She absolutely loved it from the start. It was a very impressive design and she did very well in it. A close-up of Emma's first prosthetic limb which has enabled her to run. ‘She has progressed to the second. iteration of her prosthesis, which doesn't incorporate as much of the. limb and allows her more range of motion. She is getting stronger; she's. growing and doing wonderfully.’ The. prosthesis is made of carbon fibre, Kevlar and fibreglass, materials. that are strong and extremely light, and the same as though used for. prostheses for Paralympic athletes. The first finished prosthesis weighed less than a pound and the most recent iteration, which is pink, is smaller, but weighs a little more to provide stability as she's grown taller and almost doubled her weight since surgery. Prosthesis expert Billy said: ‘The next step is trying to make sure we keep the prosthesis set up so she's ambulatory and she can run and play and do things uninhibited, but also, to keep the area of concern, the surgical site, offloaded so Dr Caldwell can do his job in keeping her completely healed. ‘As time goes by, we'll continue to provide a prosthesis that's going to allow for growth. ‘We want to provide her with full range of motion, but also give her the ability to use full strength.’ Dr Caldwell added: ‘It's been very educational for me as an equine surgeon to learn; this has certainly been my first case. ‘I think we have a long way to go before we get to this being a procedure that's routinely an option for our larger patients, but for a prosthetic limb to be an option in horses is something that's pretty exciting.’ Emma has no problem grazing alongside the other ponies and horses in the field following the efforts of her veterinary team.

I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \\"Bible Belt\\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives.

Context: Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults.

I have been told on all three occasions that I was given \\"misinformation\\" by the previous rep. That is the politically correct way to say that I was lied to. The reps don't have much authority and usually have to transfer the call to a specialist. Hold times for those guys can be over an hour. Best time to call them is Tue-Thurs 11am-2pm. Their own reps have told me that they need 300 reps in the call center and only have 150, and it used to be 110. I never got the prices I was promised and pay 25/month more than quoted for the first 6 months. The DVR is pretty good, but the Guide program is way better with Charter and Time Warner Cable. Those guys are also cheaper for more service. Can't wait to move to a place with a better cable provider. The cable goes out a few times a week with Cox also, but it is not out for more than a few minutes each time though. I would give them only one star, but they get two because their internet download speeds are fast (if you pay more) and the cable does work 99% of the time.

Ian wanted to treat Brian's agoraphobia because Choices: [1]. Ian is a doctor and wants him to get better.; [2]. Brian is a doctor and wants him to get better.;","completion":"Ian wanted to treat Brian's agoraphobia because Ian is a doctor and wants him to get better. As a healthcare professional dedicated to helping his patients, Ian felt responsible for addressing Brian's condition and believed that with the right support, Brian could overcome his fears. As a first step, Ian assessed the severity of Brian's agoraphobia to determine the appropriate course of action. He asked Brian to describe his symptoms and experiences to gain a better understanding of his specific challenges. This information would be essential in creating a personalized treatment plan suited to Brian's needs. Next, Ian decided to refer Brian to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who had expertise in treating agoraphobia. Collaborating with other medical professionals would be essential to ensure that the recommended treatments and therapies would be effective in helping Brian manage his condition. After consulting with the specialist, Ian and the mental health professional agreed that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) would be the most suitable therapeutic approach for Brian. CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety, which can play a significant role in agoraphobia. In addition to CBT, Ian also suggested that Brian could benefit from participating in an exposure therapy program. This would involve gradually exposing Brian to the situations and places that triggered his agoraphobia, at a pace that he would find manageable. The goal was to help Brian develop coping strategies to handle his anxiety more effectively and eventually feel more comfortable in these environments. Lastly, Ian considered the possibility of prescribing medication to help manage Brian's anxiety symptoms in the initial stages of treatment. However, this decision would be made in consultation with the mental health specialist, to ensure the potential benefits of medication would outweigh any potential side effects. Ian wanted nothing more than to see Brian live a happier and healthier life, free from the constraints of agoraphobia. He was determined to provide the necessary support and expertise to help Brian overcome his fears, face the world with renewed confidence, and live a life he truly enjoyed."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Muscles work by expanding and contracting - A muscle fiber gets a signal from its nerve - Proteins and chemicals release energy to either contract the muscle or relax it - When the muscles contracts the bones connected to he muscle are pulled closer together - When the muscle relaxes the bones move farther apart. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The muscles being pulled closer to the bones happens, how will it affect muscles contracting LESS INTENSELY. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of muscles being pulled closer to the bones may have an indirect effect on the process of muscle contraction. If the muscles are pulled closer to the bones, the initial distance between the bones would be reduced. As a result, when the muscles contract, they may generate less force or pull on the bones. This could lead to less movement and potentially a less intense contraction. However, the actual intensity of the muscle contraction would still be determined by the nerve signals, proteins, and chemicals involved in the process, so the perturbation might be seen as an additional factor influencing the outcome, rather than a direct impact on the contraction process itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"How are alternative splicing and coding sequences distributed?\\"","completion":"The sentence you provided states, \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short sections across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" This sentence provides information related to the concepts of alternative splicing, coding sequences, and trans-splicing, but does not offer a clear or comprehensive answer to the question \\"How are alternative splicing and coding sequences distributed?\\" To address the question, let's first explain alternative splicing and coding sequences. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple protein isoforms through the selective inclusion or exclusion of exons in the mRNA transcript. Exons are the coding regions of a gene that contain the information for protein synthesis. During mRNA maturation, introns (non-coding regions) are removed, and exons are assembled in various combinations to create different mature mRNA transcripts. The alternative splicing process allows a single gene to generate diverse proteins, which adds complexity to the proteome without requiring an increase in the number of genes. Coding sequences, on the other hand, pertain to the sections of a gene that directly encode the information required to synthesize proteins. These sequences contain the triplet codon patterns that specify the amino acids needed to construct a protein. They are integral parts of the gene structure and play a crucial role in translating the genetic information into functional proteins. Now, to answer the question of how alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed, we must consider the arrangement of coding sequences within the genome and how this influences the potential for alternative splicing. Coding sequences are typically located within exons, and the positioning of exons--particularly their relative distances and the presence of regulatory elements that control the splicing process--are essential factors in determining the potential for alternative splicing. In many cases, exons can be distributed throughout a gene, interspersed with introns. In some instances, exons can be quite small, and their distribution can impact the variety and regulation of alternative splicing events. The process of alternative splicing is influenced by cis-regulatory elements present within the exons and introns as well. These regulatory elements interact with trans-acting proteins, such as splicing factors, which collectively determine the outcome of alternative splicing events. Apart from alternative splicing, the aforementioned sentence also touches on trans-splicing, a less common form of RNA processing. Trans-splicing involves the joining of exons from two different primary RNA transcripts, generating a mature mRNA molecule. This process alters the distribution of coding sequences by physically linking exons from distinct transcripts together. Though this phenomenon has been observed in various organisms, it is less prevalent and less well understood as compared to alternative splicing. In summary, alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed throughout the genome in a complex interplay between the arrangement of exons, introns, and regulatory elements. This distribution influences the potential for alternative splicing events to occur, ultimately impacting the diversity and complexity of the proteome. The provided sentence does touch upon some aspects of alternative splicing and coding sequences; however, it does not provide sufficient detail or clarity to completely answer the question at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: After the 1969 coup, representatives of the Four Powers – France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union – were called to meet RCC representatives. The U.K. and U.S. quickly extended diplomatic recognition, hoping to secure the position of their military bases in Libya and fearing further instability. Hoping to ingratiate themselves with Gaddafi, in 1970 the U.S. informed him of at least one planned counter-coup. Such attempts to form a working relationship with the RCC failed; Gaddafi was determined to reassert national sovereignty and expunge what he described as foreign colonial and imperialist influences.

Summarize: Molly O'Brien will portray Kate McPherson, a young woman who was among 80 people forced off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada in the 1800s. Born in Dundee, O'Brien has had roles in theatre, small films and TV and has worked as a background artist on the Outlander television series. Filming on Last Footsteps of Home starts in September. Locations will include Brora, Golspie and the Strath of Kildonan. Laidhay Croft Museum, which is a 200-year-old thatched longhouse in Dunbeath, will also feature. O'Brien, who was brought up in Blairgowrie and now lives in Glasgow, said: \\"When I first heard about the role of Kate McPherson I was very excited. \\"The Highland Clearances is a subject that interests me greatly, especially in the light of the fact that although they took place hundreds of years ago, similar examples of people having to leave their homes and go elsewhere can be seen all over the world today. \\"It is a privilege to be involved in a project that is telling Kate McPherson's story in this way. \\"She really was an amazing woman - her life inspires me and symbolises the determination of we as Scots in the quest for a better life.\\" Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer. Landowners were seeking to \\"improve\\" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. Once in Canada, Ms McPherson and the others cleared from Sutherland had to walk 100 miles (161kms) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes. They were eventually settled in the Red River colony.","completion":"Molly O'Brien is an actress who will play a character named Kate McPherson in a movie about the Highland Clearances, when many people in Scotland had to leave their homes long ago.

The speaker's statement indicates a situation in which a proposed directive (a legislative act of the European Union) has generated an unusually intense emotional response, likely from the public and the politicians involved in its discussion. A draft directive is a proposal for a new law or regulation. In this context, it seems to have caused quite a heated debate or significant controversy. Directives, as legal instruments, aim to establish binding goals or objectives for the relevant EU member states to achieve. They require each member state to adapt their national laws to meet these objectives, allowing for some flexibility in how they are implemented. Once legal acts are adopted, they become enforceable and can potentially have a significant impact on the daily life of EU citizens, public institutions, industry, and businesses. Given the nature of the debate around proposed legislation, there are various reasons why a draft directive could arouse such passion. Some of these factors might include the following: 1. Societal implications: Depending on the subject matter, a draft directive might have significant implications for citizens across the member states, affecting aspects of their daily lives, civil liberties, or human rights. This may lead to a strong emotional response, as individuals feel their quality of life or access to certain rights could be put at risk. 2. Economic repercussions: A draft directive with substantial economic consequences can lead to passionate debates, particularly if different stakeholders hold conflicting interests. For instance, a proposed regulation could benefit industry at the expense of environmental or consumer protection or vice versa. 3. Political ideologies: Legislation proposals can sometimes be closely linked to political ideology and express values that are championed by one political faction but opposed by another. In such cases, heated debates and passionate contestations may ensue. 4. Historical context: A draft directive may draw on historical disputes, events, or experiences that evoke strong emotions. Associations with past traumas or grievances can touch sensitivities, leading to heated discussions. In conclusion, the given statement expresses the sentiment that the draft directive has triggered an atypically fervent and impassioned response. The reasons for such a reaction may stem from the societal, economic, or political implications vested in the proposed legislation to historical context.

Options： A. deep sea B. slaughterhouse C. cattle ranch D. countryside E. barnyard The answer to this question is:","completion":"C. cattle ranch Step 1: Analyze the context The question is about cowboys herding heifers (young female cows) across the property. Cowboys are associated with handling, herding, and tending to cattle. Properties usually associated with cattle would be a ranch, farm, or similar setting. Step 2: Evaluate each option A. deep sea - This is unrelated to the context provided. Cowboys and heifers have no connection to the sea. B. slaughterhouse - Although possible, this answer suggests a more negative outcome and doesn't align with the more typical day-to-day duties of cowboys, such as herding cattle on a property. C. cattle ranch - This option is the most suitable answer. It aligns with the context of cowboys and their responsibility in tending to cattle. D. countryside - While this may be part of the property, it does not provide a specific destination for where the heifers are being herded. E. barnyard - While somewhat related to cattle, this option is more connected to a general farm setting rather than specifically a place for herding cattle. Step 3: Select the most suitable option Based on the evaluation of each option, the most suitable answer is C. cattle ranch, as it aligns with the context and responsibilities of cowboys and their involvement in herding cattle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less electric current flows through the wire happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If less electric current flows through the wire, it will directly affect the strength of the electromagnet. Let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. Electromagnet creates a magnetic field with electricity: Electromagnetic strength depends on the amount of electric current flowing through the wire. 2. Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal: This step remains unchanged as it depends on the physical setup of the electromagnet rather than the electric current. 3. An electric current gets introduced from the power source: With the perturbation hypothesis, the electric current introduced will be lesser than initially. 4. Flows through the wire: The lesser electric current will flow through the wire. 5. Magnetic field gets created in the wire: As the electric current gets reduced, the created magnetic field will be weaker than before. 6. And the metal gets magnetized: With a weaker magnetic field, the metal piece will be less magnetized than before. 7. When turned off it is no longer magnetic: This step remains unchanged as it depends on the absence of electric current, regardless of strength. So, yes, the supposed perturbation of less electric current flowing through the wire does have an effect on the process. It directly affects the strength of the resulting magnetic field and, consequently, the strength of the electromagnet. With less electric current, the electromagnet will be weaker than intended."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"Ian Graham Gass was a renowned British geologist and researcher who played a significant role in advancing the field of geology. Born on February 20, 1926, Gass grew up in Manchester, England. From an early age, he was passionate about studying the natural sciences, which ultimately led him to pursue a successful career as a geologist. Gass attended the University of Manchester, where he initially studied chemistry. However, his passion for geology eventually took over, and he switched majors. After completing his bachelor's degree in geology, Gass went on to pursue higher education in the field. He earned his Ph.D. from the prestigious University of Oxford in 1952, where he focused on the study of igneous and metamorphic rocks, particularly the volcanic rocks of the Island of Muck in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Following the completion of his doctoral studies, Gass held various academic positions at numerous institutions. He started his career as a lecturer at the University College London in 1952. In 1954, he moved to the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, where he held a position as a senior lecturer and continued his research on African geology. During his time in Africa, Gass identified many diverse geological formations throughout Nigeria, which included the discovery of new volcanic rock specimens. This research contributed significantly to the understanding of the region's geological history and helped lay the foundation for future geoscientific investigations in the area. In 1962, Gass returned to the United Kingdom and joined the University of Leeds as a Reader in Geology. He was appointed as a professor of geology in 1967 and continued to conduct extensive research on volcanic rocks, alkaline igneous complexes, and the tectonic evolution of continents. One of Gass's most notable contributions during this period was his research on ophiolites, which are sections of the Earth's oceanic crust and mantle that have been exposed on land due to tectonic processes. This work helped decode the geological history of mountain ranges and provided valuable insights into the plate tectonic theory. Over his career, Ian Graham Gass received numerous accolades for his outstanding contributions to the field of geology. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1970, which is one of the highest honors a scientist can attain. Moreover, he was a fellow of the Geological Society of London and the Geological Society of America. He was also awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1982 in recognition of his exemplary research in the field of geology. Gass's dedication to research and education extended beyond his personal achievements, as he also mentored numerous students and researchers who went on to become esteemed geologists in their own right. Ian Graham Gass passed away on August 13, 1992, leaving behind a legacy of pioneering research that impacted the understanding of the Earth's geological processes and the evolution of continents. In conclusion, Ian Graham Gass was an accomplished British geologist whose work significantly advanced the understanding of Earth's geology, particularly through his research on volcanic rocks, ophiolites, and the tectonic evolution of continents. A dedicated educator and mentor, Gass inspired many budding geologists and left an indelible impact on the global geoscientific community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis states that the bat is sleeping, which means it's currently in a state of rest or inactivity. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis The appearance of being worn (tired or showing signs of wear and tear) could be related to the need for rest or sleep. However, being worn doesn't necessarily mean that the bat is sleeping. Step 3: Consider other possibilities There could be other reasons for a bat to look worn, such as age, illness, or injury. Additionally, just because a bat looks worn doesn't mean it's currently sleeping. The bat may have recently slept or is about to sleep, but it may not be sleeping at the moment based on the worn appearance alone.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Blisters occur when something rubs against the skin and irritates it. There are a number of causes for blisters. These include: Friction: This is generally intense friction over a short period of time. Corns and calluses develop from longer-term rubbing. Burns: Any source of intense heat from flames, steam, the sun, or hot surfaces can result in a blister Cold: Blisters can result from intense cold. Irritants or Allergens: The reaction of the skin to various chemical irritants or allergens can result in blistering. Drug reactions: There are a wide variety of drugs which can cause skin reactions, including blisters. Diseases and Infections: There are autoimmune diseases where the immune system reacts against components of the skin that can result in blisters. These all require medical attention. These disorders include pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis. Infections with viruses, such as chickenpox, shingles, and cold sores, or bacteria can also result in blistering Genetics: Certain rare genetic disorders result in widespread blistering. Insect bites: Some insect and spider bites result in blisters. Most blisters are minor and will go away on their own. However, there are a few reasons why you should go to the doctor with a blister. Go to the doctor if your blister is infected. The blister will have yellow or green pus in it if it is infected. It may also be extremely painful, red, and hot. See your doctor if the blisters are causing you severe pain. Get checked out by a doctor if your blisters keep coming back. You should also get checked out if your blisters are in odd places, like eyelids and your mouth. See your doctor if severe blisters are received from sunburns, burns, scalds, or allergic reactions. You should try to prevent any blisters from happening in the first place. To help prevent blisters on your feet, only wear properly fitting shoes or socks, shoes, and insoles marketed to help prevent blisters. You may also consider moisture-wicking socks. Place moleskin on places in your shoes to rub against your skin or put powder inside your shoes to absorb moisture. Wear gloves to help prevent blisters from working or when handling cold or hot objects.

This forceful convergence of waves and currents invariably puts the lives of divers and swimmers at risk as it can swiftly transport them out to sea, trapping them in a vortex of relentless surf. For Katrina, her extensive knowledge of oceanic conditions and an inherent passion for water safety had led her to become well-acquainted with the techniques needed to escape such treacherous situations. No stranger to the ocean and its potential perils, she had spent several years honing her lifesaving skills – both through formal training and firsthand experience – to prepare for moments like these. Upon identifying Victoria's struggle for safety amidst the churning waves, Katrina quickly assessed the situation and identified the severity of Victoria's plight. Reacting with both precision and calmness, she swam out to her friend in a diagonal course, ensuring that she did not become entrapped in the same deadly current. Along the way, she recalled the importance of conserving energy while offering assistance, quietly noting that every ounce of strength would be crucial in their survival. As she neared Victoria, Katrina saw the terror and desperation etched across her friend's face, her eyes widening with fear as she wrestled to break free from the water's vice-like hold. Wasting no time, Katrina skillfully maneuvered herself into a position where she could wrap her arm around Victoria's torso, carefully positioning her in a way that would provide maximum buoyancy while she swam. With her free arm, Katrina employed a combination of both strength and strategy to navigate out of the riptide's deadly clutch. By swimming at a forty-five-degree angle parallel to the shore, she managed to harness the power of the lateral current to disrupt the force keeping Victoria captive. Katrina knew that timing was of the essence, and her knowledge of the ocean's dynamics allowed her to expertly maneuver in a manner that would ultimately carry the pair safely back to the shallower waters. Exhausted but alive, they finally reached the safety of the shoreline. With adrenaline coursing through her veins and her heart pounding in her ears, Katrina could not help but feel a deep sense of relief, gratification, and pride in her ability to save Victoria from harm's way. It was in this moment, amidst the chaos and ferocity of nature's unpredictable power, that Katrina realized the magnitude of her lifesaving skills and the capacity she possessed to make a real difference. Ever thankful for her friend's quick-thinking and steadfast resolve, Victoria would come to appreciate the importance of heeding the lessons and warnings that the ocean presents. As for Katrina, she would use this experience to further her commitment to water safety and education, ensuring that fewer lives fall victim to the deceptive grasp of the dangerous ocean currents. For both women, this harrowing encounter would serve as a lesson in the importance of preparedness, respect for nature, and trust in one another's abilities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. Context: In December 1998 Rouvas released his sixth album (the first with his new label): Kati Apo Mena (Something From Me), written by Giorgos Theofanous. \\"Den Ehi Sidera I Kardia Sou\\" (\\"Your Heart Doesn't Have Steel Rails\\") was a hit, and remains one of his most-popular songs. To promote the album Rouvas performed at the Virgin Megastore in Athens, where thousands of fans created a traffic jam. The next year, Rouvas records \\"Oso Exo Esena\\" (\\"As Long As I Have You\\"), a duet with singer Stelios Rokkos. The two artists work and perform together at Bio Bio in Athens during the summer. In March 2000 Rouvas released his seventh album, 21os Akatallilos (21+ X-Rated), and performed with Katy Garbi at Pili Axiou in Thessaloniki. The album and its first single, \\"Andexa\\" (\\"I Held Out\\"), reached number one on the charts. During May rehearsals for summer performances Rouvas was hospitalized with abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as peritonitis and required an appendectomy. On 25 October 2000, he began appearing with Antonis Remos and Peggy Zina at Apollonas for the winter season. That year Rouvas became the Pepsi spokesperson for the company's Greek summer campaign making a first television ad, a first for a Greek entertainer. His collaboration with Pepsi continued into 2001, with a May television ad. The advertisement, featuring a semi-nude Rouvas holding a Pepsi bottle in front of his genitals, was controversial among women's rights and parental associations. Calling it \\"unsightly, vulgar and unacceptable\\", they tried to have the ad blocked as \\"disgrac[ing] childhood innocence and dignity.\\" The Pepsi Tour 2001, of seven Greek cities, followed. During summer 2000 Rouvas, Psinakis and a number of other celebrities visited Mykonos on a yacht borrowed from a local physician. They were accused of drug possession, since the yacht contained narcotics. The incident was publicized amid speculation that Rouvas might have a drug addiction. Although the doctor admitted that the narcotics were his, his guests were questioned. Wishing to avoid court, Rouvas paid a fine and minimized the incident. However, thousands of T-shirts were printed which read: \\"Imoun ki ego sto kotero!\\" (\\"I was on the yacht, too!\\").

I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Chinese A:","completion":"Title: The Price of Progress Genre: Drama/Comedy Plot: In a small, financially struggling Midwestern American town, the residents are desperate to bring life back to their once-prosperous community. When a Chinese multinational corporation announces plans to open a manufacturing plant in the town, everyone is initially overjoyed by the prospect of new job opportunities and an economic boost. The main character, Emma Thompson, is a single mother working two jobs to make ends meet for her and her teenage daughter, Lily. She is excited about the new plant, hoping that it would improve their lives. However, things take an unexpected turn when rumors begin to circulate that the corporation plans to staff the plant with Chinese workers instead of hiring the local townspeople. The reasoning behind this move is the lower wages that Chinese workers would accept, keeping costs low for the corporation. Angry and frustrated by this decision, the people of the town, led by Emma, decide to band together and fight for their right to have the company hire them instead. They hold protests, attend town hall meetings, and launch a social media campaign to raise awareness of their plight. As the story unfolds, a rivalry develops between the local townspeople and the Chinese workers. However, Emma's daughter, Lily, unexpectedly befriends one of the young Chinese workers, Wang Li, who is a victim of human trafficking and is forced to work for the company. Through their friendship, it becomes clear that the Chinese workers are also being exploited, and Emma realizes that the real enemy is not the workers themselves, but the corporation taking advantage of both groups. Together, Emma and Wang Li expose the truth about the company's labor practices, leading to a nationwide debate about the consequences of globalization and the true cost of cheap labor. Eventually, the corporation is forced to change its policies, agreeing to pay fair wages to all workers, both local and foreign. In the end, the town benefits from the new factory, and Emma takes a job there, ensuring a more stable future for her and her daughter. Meanwhile, Wang Li, having gained his freedom, decides to stay in the town and continue working alongside the townspeople. The movie ends on a hopeful note, showing that despite their differences, people can come together to fight for a common cause and create positive change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcÃ©. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims' skin and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and revealing that it may cause her to leave.

Is Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths. a good answer to this question? OPT: A). yes. B). no.","completion":"B). No. While the provided answer touches upon some key points, it does not offer a comprehensive understanding of the practices of Buddhism. Here is a more detailed and long answer to better address the question: The practices of Buddhism are based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. Buddhism emphasizes the cultivation of wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline to achieve the ultimate goal of enlightenment, or Nirvana. There are several core teachings and practices central to Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Five Precepts, and meditation. 1. The Four Noble Truths: The Four Noble Truths are the foundational teachings of Buddhism and serve as a guide to understanding the nature of existence. They are: a) The truth of suffering (Dukkha): Life is characterized by suffering, be it physical, emotional, or mental. b) The truth of the cause of suffering (Samudaya): Suffering is caused by craving and attachment to transient objects and experiences. This cause is often referred to as the Three Poisons—desire, hatred, and ignorance. c) The truth of the end of suffering (Nirodha): By eliminating craving and attachment, one can achieve the cessation of suffering. d) The truth of the path to the cessation of suffering (Magga): The path to the cessation of suffering is found through following the Eightfold Path. 2. The Eightfold Path: This path offers practical guidance and practice for achieving the cessation of suffering. The Eightfold Path consists of: a) Right Understanding: Developing a deep understanding of the Four Noble Truths. b) Right Intention: Cultivating an attitude of compassionate non-harming and renouncing craving. c) Right Speech: Communicating truthfully, kindly, and helpfully. d) Right Action: Acting ethically and responsibly toward oneself and others. e) Right Livelihood: Engaging in an occupation that promotes peace and well-being, avoiding those that contribute to suffering. f) Right Effort: Diligently working to maintain wholesome states of mind and eliminate unwholesome ones. g) Right Mindfulness: Developing awareness and being fully present in each moment. h) Right Concentration: Practicing meditation to cultivate deeper states of concentration and insight. 3. The Five Precepts: These precepts serve as guidelines for ethical conduct in daily life. They are: a) Abstaining from taking life. b) Abstaining from taking what is not freely given. c) Abstaining from sexual misconduct. d) Abstaining from false speech. e) Abstaining from intoxicants leading to heedlessness. 4. Meditation: Meditation is a central practice in Buddhism for cultivating mindfulness, concentration, and insight. There are many forms of meditation in Buddhism, with two primary types being: a) Mindfulness meditation (Vipassana): A practice focused on developing insight into the nature of reality through observation of the impermanence, suffering, and selflessness of phenomena. b) Concentration meditation (Samatha): A practice aimed at developing deep concentration and mental tranquility, often by focusing on a single object or concept. By engaging in these practices, Buddhists aim to eradicate ignorance and cultivate wisdom, fostering direct understanding and perception of dependent origination (the interconnected nature of phenomena), and ultimately, achieving enlightenment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Life-threatening Injuries Result From Domestic Incident in Merthyr Tydfil Introduction A recent domestic incident in Merthyr Tydfil, a town in Wales, has resulted in a man sustaining life-threatening injuries. While the exact nature of the incident remains under investigation, these events often involve violence or abuse within a household, which highlights the ongoing need for increased awareness and resources to address domestic violence. Details of the Incident According to the local police, the incident took place in a residential neighborhood in Merthyr Tydfil. The victim, an adult male, was transported to a nearby hospital following the altercation. Though specific details on the nature of the injuries have not been disclosed, it is evident that they were of a severe nature, necessitating urgent medical attention. The authorities have emphasized that the case is being treated as a \\"domestic incident,\\" indicating that it likely occurred within a household or close relationship. While the police have yet to release details of the circumstances leading up to the violent event, it can be inferred that such situations often involve intimate partners or family members. Addressing Domestic Violence Domestic incidents, such as this, are a tragic reminder of the prevalence of domestic violence within our society. Many experts argue that the true extent of domestic violence remains hidden due to unreported cases, stigma, and a lack of awareness surrounding the issue. It is crucial for communities to come together to support victims, raise awareness, and work towards breaking the cycles of violence that persist in so many households. Social, emotional, and psychological factors often contribute to the complexity of domestic violence incidents. These include, but are not limited to, financial stress, substance abuse, and unaddressed mental health issues. By addressing the root causes of domestic violence and providing support to those affected, communities can begin to break these cycles and create safer environments for individuals and families. Resources for Victims of Domestic Violence It is important for anyone impacted by domestic violence, either directly or indirectly, to know that help is available. Multiple resources exist to aid victims, including hotlines, shelters, and support groups. In the UK, organizations such as Women's Aid and Refuge, as well as the national domestic violence helpline, offer 24-hour support services to those in need. For those who suspect a friend or family member may be experiencing domestic violence, it is crucial to offer a listening ear, emotional support, and guidance towards appropriate resources. It is also important to remember that domestic violence does not discriminate and affects individuals of all genders, ages, and backgrounds. Conclusion The unfortunate incident that unfolded in Merthyr Tydfil is yet another stark reminder of the devastation that domestic violence can bring to individuals and families. As investigations continue into this specific case, it is imperative for communities, law enforcement, and support organizations to work together in addressing the underlying causes of domestic violence and providing aid to those affected. Together, we can end the cycle of violence and create a more compassionate, supportive world for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In addition, they choose among elective subjects to complete their high school education. Electives include subjects in technology, music, art, and foreign languages. Each student in the school has their own locker for books and personal items.

Cheating in any form is strictly prohibited in American schools. And in fact, high school students usually don't cheat. If they are caught cheating, they will have to face severe punishment. Each school holds certain yearly activities for all school students, such as homecoming , prom night , holiday celebrations, etc. Most high schools have at least one sports team that competes in local games, and all students are encouraged to take part in athletics. Schools often offer football, baseball and softball, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and soccer. Some may even have sports like golf, swimming, gymnastics and cross-country skiing.

I know that the answer to the question \\"An adjective that refers to threefold is?\\" is in \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard.

Piaget describes adolescence as the stage of life in which the individual's thoughts start taking more of an abstract form and the egocentric thoughts decrease. This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective.

Inspired by the variety of music that his parents listened to, which included country, rock, disco and R&B, McGaughey first sang in his church choir before founding an R&B band. He later switched his focus to country music, performing in various bars and clubs in Texas. McGaughey, after attending junior college near his hometown, found work selling shoes at a shopping mall. You Gotta Love That, his fourth album, also received a platinum certification and producing four singles: \\"For a Change\\", \\"They're Playin' Our Song\\" and the title track (respectively the first, second, and fourth singles) all peaked at No. 3, while \\"If I Was a Drinkin' Man\\" reached No. 16. McCoy's self-titled fifth studio album began a decline in his chart momentum. Although it was certified gold, Neal McCoy accounted for only one Top Ten hit in a cover of The Casinos' 1967 doo-wop single \\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\\". The next two singles -- \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" and \\"That Woman of Mine\\" -- both peaked at No. 35. Also in 1996, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single \\"Hope\\", the proceeds of which went to the T. J. Martell Foundation's cancer research.

Be Good at It, his sixth studio release, followed in 1998. This was his first album since Where Forever Begins not to include a Top Ten hit. The title track, \\"If You Can't Be Good, Be Good at It\\", was the highest-peaking single release from it at No. 22, followed by \\"Party On\\", which became his first single since 1992 to miss Top 40 entirely. After it came the No. 29 \\"Love Happens Like That.\\" McCoy made a second appearance on a multi-artist charity single that same year, as one of several collaborators on \\"One Heart at a Time\\", a song written by Victoria Shaw to benefit cystic fibrosis research. In 1999, McCoy released his final album for Atlantic, The Life of the Party. It only accounted for two singles: the Phil Vassar co-write \\"I Was\\" at No. 37 and \\"The Girls of Summer\\" at No. 42. He, Tracy Byrd, and T. Graham Brown also sang guest vocals on \\"Now That's Awesome\\", a song featuring snippets of a Bill Engvall comedy sketch, found on Engvall's Now That's Awesome album.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What term provides a career description that matches the brothers Louis and Nathan Thompson? The answer is:","completion":"The term that best provides a career description matching the brothers Louis and Nathan Thompson is \\"roller coaster designers\\" or \\"roller coaster engineers\\". Louis and Nathan Thompson are renowned for their work as roller coaster engineers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born into a family of engineers, they were inspired from a young age to build and innovate. They went on to become among the most influential figures in the amusement park industry, significantly contributing to the development and popularization of roller coasters as we know them today. Louis Thompson is arguably the more famous of the two brothers, largely due to his invention of the \\"Scenic Railway\\", widely considered the world's first modern roller coaster. This revolutionary design, first unveiled at a fairground in Massachusetts in 1884, introduced several new features that set it apart from its precursors. Most notably, it was the first roller coaster to be designed as a complete circuit, meaning that the cars would end their journey at the same place they started, something we take for granted in roller coasters today. Meanwhile, Nathan Thompson's contribution to roller coaster engineering was no less impactful. He focused on improving the safety of roller coasters, which at that time were notorious for causing numerous accidents. He developed a new braking system that reduced the chance of a car derailing or failing to stop, significantly improving the safety of such rides. The Thompson brothers' work eventually led to the formation of the L.A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company, which operated and produced roller coasters across the United States and Europe. The company grew rapidly and became a dominant force in the amusement park industry in the early 20th century. In summary, the term \\"roller coaster designers\\" or \\"roller coaster engineers\\" would suitably describe the career paths of Louis and Nathan Thompson. Their work and innovations in roller coaster design and safety have left a lasting legacy, and they are widely recognized as pioneers of the roller coaster industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned? , can you please find it? Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

She would just decide, in the middle of the night, even as early as 2 in the morning that we should just race the city, see places… She always had those cravings to do stuff at strange times, getting to sport events with me at the other bit of the country… This crazy kind of life got us in a big lot of troubles. People trying rape her, attack us and much many more. it was happening too often and I often had to be quite violent to these people so she stays in one piece.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis (in other stories, Apollo himself had killed Coronis).

It does not necessarily imply non-stop talking. 2. Constantly: This word indicates that Jim talked without any interruptions, breaks, or pauses, making it the most appropriate choice for conveying the idea that he never stopped talking. 3. Always forever: This phrase is redundant and less precise in describing Jim's non-stop talking. \\"Always\\" is more suitable on its own, but as will be discussed below, it is still not as fitting as \\"constantly.\\" 4. Always: This word can mean that Jim generally talked all the time but doesn't necessarily imply that he talked non-stop without any breaks or pauses. 5.

The reviewer clearly expresses their satisfaction with the sugar-free version of York Peppermint Patties, stating that they \\"love\\" them and mentioning that they \\"taste just like the original.\\" The comparison to the original indicates that the alternative product meets the reviewer's expectations in terms of taste and quality. Moreover, the reviewer highlights that \\"no one can tell them apart,\\" which further emphasizes the high degree of similarity between the sugar-free and regular versions of York Peppermint Patties. This statement would be considered a compliment, as it praises the sugar-free version for delivering the same experience as the original product, especially considering the reviewer's need to watch their sugar intake. However, there is a minor negative sentiment in the review when the reviewer mentions that the sugar-free York Peppermint Patties are \\"very difficult to find in stores.\\" This remark points to the limited availability of the product, which can result in inconvenience for the customers seeking to purchase it.

Low temperatures at night will be around 11°C. We have weak northwesterly winds.\\" Let's break this down in a more detailed way: 1. \\"On Saturday we can expect sunny weather\\": This part of the text refers to the general weather condition that is expected for the coming Saturday. Sunny weather generally means clear skies with almost no cloud cover, leading to a bright, sunny day. 2. \\"Morning temperatures will be around 11°C\\": This part of the forecast focuses on the temperature in the morning hours of the Saturday. The expected temperature is 11°C, which could be considered relatively cool depending on the time of year and the geographical location. 3. \\"During the day, they will reach a maximum of 34°C\\": This suggests that as the day progresses, the temperatures will rise significantly, reaching a peak of 34°C. This is a rather high temperature and could denote a hot summer day. 4. \\"Low temperatures at night will be around 11°C\\": This part refers to the nighttime temperatures, which are forecasted to drop back down to around 11°C. This could indicate a significant daily temperature range, again common in summer months in many regions. 5. \\"We have weak northwesterly winds\\": This is information about the expected wind conditions. The forecast predicts weak winds, moving from the northwest direction. The wind direction and strength can have an impact on the perceived temperature and the general weather development. For example, in some regions, certain wind directions are associated with particular weather patterns. The term 'weak' suggests that the wind will be gentle, and likely not a cause for concern. Overall, this forecast predicts a sunny, warm Saturday with a substantial temperature range from morning to midday to night, and gentle northwesterly breezes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

To put it in simpler words, Darwin was not sure how traits got mixed when they were passed from parents to their kids.

If you're on one of these medications, it could be the cause of your high prolactin levels. Dopamine, a brain chemical, blocks some secretion of prolactin. When you're on medications that block or lower your dopamine levels, your prolactin levels may rise. Some antipsychotics can cause this effect, such as risperidone, molindone, trifluoperazine, and haloperidol, and some antidepressants can, too. Metoclopramide, which is prescribed for severe nausea and acid reflux, may also increase the secretion of prolactin. A few medications that treat high blood pressure could also be the culprit, though it happens less frequently with these medications, which include reserpine, verapamil, and alpha-methyldopa. You don't want to go off a medication abruptly, especially one like an antipsychotic, which can have severe withdrawal effects. Therefore, if you want to get off one of these medications, discuss the issue with your doctor first. They may be able to switch you to another medication that doesn't have this effect. This medication has been shown to reduce prolactin levels when taken in place of other antipsychotics or when taken in addition to other antipsychotics. Ask your doctor if taking this medication is a possibility for you. Antipsychotics have the potential to raise prolactin since it inhibits the dopamine that causes prolactin to secrete from the pituitary gland. For long-term antipsychotic treatment, you may develop a tolerance so your prolactin levels return to normal, but they may stay above normal levels. This medication can cause side effects like dizziness, nervousness, headaches, stomach issues, weight gain, and pain in your joints. It can also make you feel unsteady on your feet. Summary:","completion":"Some medicines can make a brain chemical called dopamine go down, and this makes another thing called prolactin go up, which can cause some problems, so you should talk to your doctor if you think your medicine might be doing this."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Choices: - openness - instability - hollowness - strange sounds - weakness The rationale to choose \\"hollowness\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Answer: hollowness The rationale to choose \\"hollowness\\" as the answer is that James initially believed the desk was built with solidity, which suggests that he expected it to be strong and sturdy. However, when he rapped on it (tapped or knocked on the surface), the sound he heard contradicted his original assumption. Out of the given choices, \\"hollowness\\" is most logical since it directly contrasts with solidity. A hollow sound would indicate that the desk might not be as solid as James initially thought, possibly due to the presence of empty spaces or less dense materials within the desk's construction. The other choices do not directly relate to the sound produced by rapping on a desk: - Openness refers to the state of being open or available, which doesn't relate to the sound made by tapping a desk. - Instability refers to the lack of stability or steadiness, which could be a consequence of the hollowness, but not the sound produced. - Strange sounds are too vague, and do not specifically indicate a contradiction to solidity. - Weakness refers to the lack of strength, which could be another consequence of the hollowness, but it does not describe the sound itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first quarter, Green Bay got off to a fast start by capping off the game's opening drive with rookie RB DeShawn Wynn getting a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears tied the game with RB Cedric Benson's 10-yard TD run. The Packers would end the first half with QB Brett Favre completing a 41-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, along with rookie kicker Mason Crosby converting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Chicago crept closer with kicker Robbie Gould converting a 44-yard field goal. Green Bay responded with Crosby kicking a 37-yard field goal, yet the Bears pulled to within three as QB Brian Griese completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who suggests using the tree hazard? Beetee Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Introduce the main characters and setting In a small, close-knit town called Greenfield, a group of friends – Alex, Tara, Hank, and Mia – are high school students with a passion for environmental conservation. They're all members of the school's Environmental Club, advised by their science teacher, Mr. Beetee. Step 2: Establish the conflict A massive construction project is planned at the edge of town, threatening to destroy a significant portion of the local forest. The town residents are divided over the issue – some support the economic benefits, while others fear the environmental damage. Step 3: Introduce the tree hazard During one of the club meetings, Mr. Beetee suggests using the \\"tree hazard\\" as a means to stop or at least stall the construction project. The tree hazard refers to a specific tree deep within the forest that is infected with a rare, contagious fungus. If the fungus spreads, it could pose a significant risk to the surrounding ecosystem. Step 4: Plan the mission The Environmental Club members plan a covert mission to introduce the tree hazard to the construction site. Their goal is to persuade the construction company and the town to reconsider the project, weighing the potential environmental destruction against the purported economic benefits. Step 5: Execute the plan The group embarks on a challenging adventure through the forest, facing numerous obstacles as they locate and transport the hazardous tree. They remain cautious about not spreading the fungus themselves, taking necessary precautions. Step 6: Consequences and resolution Once the hazardous tree is placed at the construction site, news of the contagious fungus spreads rapidly. Concerned residents, fearing the ecological damage and health risks, demand the construction project be halted. The construction company agrees to review their plans and explore alternative ways to boost the local economy without jeopardizing the environment. Step 7: Character growth and development Throughout the movie, the main characters transform not only as environmental activists but also as friends. They learn to cooperate, trust, and rely on each other to overcome various challenges. Mr. Beetee serves as a wise mentor, guiding them in their mission and helping them understand the complexities of balancing economic growth with environmental conservation. In conclusion, the movie plot revolves around an environmental conflict in a small town. The protagonist group, led by Mr. Beetee's suggestion, embarks on a perilous adventure to introduce a tree hazard to the construction site to protect the local ecosystem and raise awareness. This ultimately leads to the reconsideration of the project, the strengthening of friendships, and lessons learned about finding balance in life and society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: To attach felt to a piece of wood.","completion":"To attach felt to a piece of wood, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials Ensure that you have the following items: - A piece of wood (clean and smooth surface) - A piece of felt (cut to the desired size) - A strong adhesive, such as wood glue or fabric glue (preferably one that dries clear) - A foam brush or a regular brush for applying the adhesive - Scissors or a utility knife to trim the felt, if necessary - A clean cloth or paper towel - Heavy objects or clamps to hold the felt in place while the adhesive dries (optional) Step 2: Prep the surfaces Ensure that the wood surface is clean, free of dust, and smooth. You can use sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots or imperfections. Similarly, for the felt, be sure it is cut to the desired size, and free of any fuzz or loose fibers that might get in the way of a good bond. Step 3: Apply adhesive Apply an even layer of the adhesive to either the felt or the wood using the foam brush or regular brush. Make sure to cover the entire surface that you want the felt to bond to, and spread the glue evenly to prevent any lumps or bumps. Step 4: Attach the felt Carefully position the felt on the wood, aligning the edges and corners as desired. Press the felt onto the wood, starting from the center and working your way out to the edges. This will help eliminate any air bubbles that may get trapped between the felt and the wood. Use your hands to firmly press the felt onto the wood, ensuring a strong bond. Step 5: Secure the felt You may want to place heavy objects or use clamps to hold the felt in place while the adhesive dries. This ensures that the felt remains flat against the wood and reduces the chance of it lifting or peeling away. Step 6: Wipe off excess adhesive If there is any excess adhesive that has seeped out from the edges, use a clean cloth or paper towel to gently wipe it away before it dries. Step 7: Let it dry Allow the adhesive to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically 24 hours. Do not disturb the felt or the wood during this time, as it may weaken the bond. Step 8: Trim, if necessary If the felt is not perfectly aligned with the wood, or if there is any overhang, use scissors or a utility knife to carefully trim the excess felt. By following these steps, you can successfully attach felt to a piece of wood for a neat and durable finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. Beginning in 1919, Hearst began to build Hearst Castle, which he never completed, on a 240,000 acres (97,000 hectares) ranch at San Simeon, California, which he furnished with art, antiques and entire rooms brought from the great houses of Europe. He also used the ranch for an Arabian horse breeding operation. San Simeon was also used in the 1960 film Spartacus as the estate of Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier). He also had a property on the McCloud River in Siskiyou County, in far northern California, called Wyntoon. Wyntoon was designed by famed architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle and worked in collaboration with William J. Dodd on a number of other projects. In 1947, Hearst paid 120,000 for an H-shaped Beverly Hills mansion, (located at 1011 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills CA 90210) on 3.7 acres three blocks from Sunset Boulevard. This home, known as Beverly House, was once perhaps the \\"most expensive\\" private home in the U.S., valued at 165 million (PS81.4 million). It has 29 bedrooms, three swimming pools, tennis courts, its own cinema and a nightclub. Lawyer and investor Leonard Ross has owned it since 1976. The estate went on the market for 95 million at the end of 2010. The property had not sold by 2012 but was then listed at a significantly increased asking price of 135 million. The Beverly House, as it has come to be known, has some cinematic connections. It was the setting for the gruesome scene in the film The Godfather depicting a horse's severed head in the bed of film-producer, Jack Woltz. The character was head of a film company called International, the name of Hearst's early film company. According to Hearst Over Hollywood, John and Jacqueline Kennedy stayed at the house for part of their honeymoon. They watched their first film together as a married couple in the mansion's cinema. It was a Hearst-produced film from the 1920s. In the early 1890s, Hearst began building a mansion on the hills overlooking Pleasanton, California on land purchased by his father a decade earlier. Hearst's mother took over the project, hired Julia Morgan to finish it as her home, and named it Hacienda del Pozo de Verona. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club from 1925 to 1969, when it was destroyed in a massive fire.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

When these muscles contract, the volume inside the thoracic cavity increases, creating a decrease in pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure outside the body. As a result, air flows into the lungs through the respiratory tract to equalize the pressure. The respiratory tract consists of several structures through which air passes during inhalation: 1. Nasal cavity: Air enters the body through the nostrils and is filtered, warmed, and humidified in the nasal cavity. 2. Pharynx: The pharynx is a common pathway shared by both the respiratory and digestive systems, where air moves to the larynx from the nasal cavity. 3. Larynx: Also known as the voice box, the larynx is responsible for sound production and contains the epiglottis, which prevents food and liquids from entering the trachea. 4. Trachea: The trachea, or windpipe, is a tube that extends from the larynx to the bronchi, transporting air to the lungs. 5. Bronchi: The trachea bifurcates into the left and right bronchi, each of which enters a lung. The bronchi then branch into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. 6. Alveoli: At the end of the bronchioles are small sac-like structures called alveoli, which are surrounded by a network of capillaries. It is within the alveoli where the actual gas exchange takes place. During inhalation, oxygen-rich air reaches the alveoli, and the oxygen molecules diffuse across the thin alveolar wall and the adjoining capillary wall, entering the bloodstream. The oxygen then binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells, which transport the oxygen throughout the body to be utilized by cells during various processes, including cellular respiration. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product generated by cellular respiration, diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli, moving across the capillary and alveolar walls in the opposite direction of the oxygen flow. Carbon dioxide then gets exhaled as part of the waste gas when the individual breathes out. In summary, the first step in the gas exchange process is inhalation, during which oxygen-rich air enters the lungs via the respiratory tract. This sets the stage for the subsequent steps of oxygen moving into the bloodstream, being utilized by body cells, and carbon dioxide being removed and exhaled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is a recollection of Paulo 's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela . The novel serves as part adventure story , part guide to self - discovery . - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Paulo Coelho de Souza (, , ; born August 24, 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist.

Write an article based on this summary: – Daniel Craig's lack of, um, warmth regarding his role as 007 may come across in his fourth and probably final James Bond flick, Spectre. Thought critics aren't exactly bashing it, the film isn't getting anything close to the kind reviews that Skyfall did back in 2012. Here's what critics are saying: \\"It's not—as some critics have said—the worst\\" Bond flick, writes David Edelstein at Vulture. It's \\"satisfying\\" enough, and actually \\"fun, even if it's a mishmash, leaving you shaken, not stirred.\\" But the film doesn't \\"deliver the nipping, slightly syncopated rhythms of the best Bond films,\\" and the bad guys don't get the send-offs you'd expect. Meanwhile, Craig, who had planned to reclaim some of the earlier films' irony, doesn't quite manage. Rex Reed titles his review as follows: \\"Bland, James Bland.\\" Spectre is actually \\"one of the least interesting and most preposterous chapters in 007 history,\\" he writes at the Observer. \\"We've seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers.\\" Craig, in particular, looks bored. Steven Rea, however, is a fan. \\"It's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth,\\" he writes at the Philadelphia Inquirer. He adds a \\"trim, terse, and tough\\" Craig \\"has proved himself the perfect Bond for the millennium,\\" and doesn't disappoint here, though \\"at almost 21/2 hours, Spectre can drag.\\" \\"It's not the best Bond you've ever seen, but on a scale of 1 to 10, it's a solid 008,\\" writes Stephen Whitty at the Newark Star-Ledger. \\"The jokiness is toned down, and the grown-up elegance—mostly courtesy of a guest appearance by Monica Bellucci—is heightened.\\" He adds that the movie has a \\"slow middle\\" that tries to wrap up forgotten plot points from the earlier Craig movies, and a \\"terrible theme song.\\"","completion":"Once upon a time, there was an actor named Daniel Craig who played the role of a cool secret agent named James Bond, also known as 007.

However, some people who watch movies and tell others about them, called critics, are not as excited about Spectre as they were about the earlier movie called Skyfall. One critic named David Edelstein said that the movie is fun but not as great as some people hoped it would be. Another critic named Rex Reed thought the movie was a bit boring and not very new or exciting. Daniel Craig, who plays James Bond, looks a little bored too.

That spot, which aired Saturday, has set a Guinness World Record (the former record-holding commercial, by Nivea, was a measly hour), and the honor goes to none other than Arby's. The fast-food chain created the half-day commercial as a promo for its Smokehouse Brisket Sandwich, a limited edition offering that Fox News reports is packed with BBQ sauce, fried onions, smoked gouda, and brisket that has been smoked for, you guessed it, 13 hours. The must-see TV was dialogue-free, reports the New York Times, and filming it was not without its drama. The goal was to shoot it in a single take, and the first two efforts at doing so flopped, due to too much smoke and a burnt-out light bulb. The commercial aired at 1pm Saturday on My9, a station in Duluth, Minn., and wrapped up at 2am Sunday with quite the climax: The previously shut door to the smoker opened, the brisket was removed, and the sandwich was made. Why Duluth? The town's News Tribune asked that, and got a sort-of answer from a rep for the company, which says a commercial of that length \\"required that we cast a pretty wide net.

A restaurant called Arby's made this super long commercial to talk about their special Smokehouse Brisket Sandwich, which has yummy things like BBQ sauce, fried onions, smoked cheese, and a big piece of meat called brisket. The commercial was so long because the brisket is cooked for 13 hours, so they showed the whole cooking process on TV, like a big movie! Some people might think it's a little silly to have a commercial that long, but guess what? It set a world record! Yep, it's the longest commercial ever, and now everyone is talking about it.

Q:The answer to the question: Who are the communists demanding for the US to withdraw? is inside the article: The War Game depicts the prelude to, and the immediate weeks of the aftermath of, a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. The narrator says that Britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from Vulcan and Victor nuclear bombers of the British V bomber force. The film begins on Friday, 16 September (presumably 1966; this date wouldn't appear again until 1977). A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings. It hypothesises that in any nuclear crisis, the Soviet Union would be obliged to fire all of them as early as possible in order to avoid their destruction by counterattack, hence the rapid progression from tactical to strategic nuclear exchange., can you guess it ?

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did.

The first parks master plan envisioned the presence of a major park in each quadrant of the city, ensuring equal distribution of green areas and making them accessible to people living in different parts of the city. These parks included Will Rogers Park, Lincoln Park, Trosper Park, and Woodson Park. Furthermore, the Grand Boulevard loop was designed to connect these parks, making it easier for residents to travel between them and encouraging the use of these public spaces. Although some sections of the Grand Boulevard loop no longer exist, the original design aimed to create a seamless connection between the parks. Each park has its own unique features designed to attract various visitors. Will Rogers Park, for example, is home to the Lycan Conservatory, the Rose Garden, and Butterfly Garden, all of which were built during the WPA (Works Progress Administration) era. This park provides opportunities for leisure, education, and experiencing nature for citizens. In addition, Oklahoma City hosts the Martin Park Nature Center, a natural habitat located in the far northwest part of the city, offering residents a chance to experience and appreciate the local flora and fauna in a preserved environment. The city's commitment to green spaces and recreation is also exhibited through cultural offerings like the American Banjo Museum, which not only preserves and exhibits decorated banjos from the early 20th century but also hosts concerts and lectures to educate the public about the banjo's historical and cultural significance. In summary, parks were an integral part of Oklahoma City's original design through the first parks master plan, which aimed to create an accessible network of green spaces, recreational areas, and cultural attractions for residents.

Worth a total of US 600 million, the paintings ate by French Impressionist masters, including Monet, Cezanne, Renoir and Degas. As an art style, Impressionism was developed inFranceduring the late 19thand early 20thcenturies. Their work was a fresh and original way of painting. It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it. Often painting outside, rather than in a studio, the artists observed nature more directly and tried to capture individual moments in time especially the changing light of the sun. They avoided black and earth color1s and as a result their work is often very bright and can also look like that it is shining. When they first appeared, the artists were criticized for not finishing their paintings and for being lazy. Critics said the Impressionists were satisfied with just a few inexact brushstrokes instead of completing a real painting. It was an art critic who first used the term \\"Impressionist\\" in a review of Monet's work \\"Impression, Sunrise\\"(1873) to satirize his loose, inexact manner of painting. \\"Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love,\\" said Monet.

They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \\"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\\" and for his having \\"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\".In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \\"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \\"Lumberjack Song\\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.A documentary film entitled George Harrison: Living in the... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award?

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Why couldn't the butterfly fly? Because _ . A) it got out of its cocoon without struggle B) nobody had taught it to fly C) all newborn butterflies could not fly D) the man broke its wings Answer:","completion":"A) it got out of its cocoon without struggle"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? See options at the end Kayla has a muscular body while Jessica does not, mostly due to the fact that Possible answers: (A). Kayla spends no time pumping iron. (B). Jessica spends no time pumping iron.","completion":"The sentence should end with option (B). The correct sentence will read: \\"Kayla has a muscular body while Jessica does not, mostly due to the fact that Jessica spends no time pumping iron.\\" This sentence shows a clear contrast between Kayla's muscular body and Jessica's lack of it. The fact mentioned that Jessica spends no time pumping iron explains why her body is not as muscular as Kayla's. Pumping iron is a colloquial term, which essentially means to lift weights or to do resistance exercise, most commonly related to bodybuilding. Building a more muscular or toned body typically requires engaging in regular resistance training or weightlifting exercises and maintaining an appropriate diet that promotes muscle growth. Resistance training targets specific muscle groups and forces them to work against a source of resistance. This exertion causes the muscles to break down on a cellular level, ultimately leading to muscle fibers repairing, rebuilding, and growing back stronger and denser than before. On the other hand, if an individual doesn't engage in regular resistance training or weightlifting exercises, their muscle tone and strength may not be as prominent or developed as someone who does, which is the case for Jessica in this situation. It's important to remember, however, that simply lifting weights alone does not guarantee a muscular physique like Kayla's. A combination of factors, including genetics, nutrition, and consistency, will determine the outcome of physical appearance and muscle development in an individual. In conclusion, the sentence highlights the difference in lifestyles between Kayla and Jessica concerning their physical fitness and body composition. In order to develop a more muscular physique like Kayla, Jessica would need to invest time and effort in weightlifting or resistance training activities. Moreover, both of them have to focus on proper nutrition, adequate rest, and patience to achieve their respective fitness goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Background: Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) is activated by proteases involved in allergy and triggers airway epithelial secretion and inflammation. PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells. Objective: We tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization. Methods: Endogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bat makes sound waves happens, how will it affect the bat will not know where objects are. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the process of the bat making sound waves is disrupted, it will affect the bat's ability to know where objects are. Let's analyze the consequences of this perturbation on the overall process. Direct Effects: 1. Disruption of Echolocation: The main direct effect would be that the bat's echolocation abilities will be impaired. Echolocation is the primary means by which bats navigate, detect obstacles, and locate prey. If the bat cannot make sound waves, this essential biological function would be disrupted, leading to difficulties in perceiving its surroundings accurately. 2. Increased chances of collision: When a bat cannot effectively use echolocation, it becomes more likely to collide with objects in its environment, as it will not receive any information regarding the location and distance of these objects. This could potentially result in injuries to the bat, damage to its wings, or disorientation. Indirect Effects: 1. Decreased foraging efficiency: Bats rely on echolocation to find and capture prey (often insects) while flying. If the bat is unable to make sound waves, it will have a harder time locating and catching prey, which could eventually lead to decreased foraging efficiency and malnutrition. 2. Reduced ability to avoid predators: Bats use echolocation not only to navigate and locate food but also to detect potential threats and evade predators. A bat that cannot make sound waves is more likely to become a target for predators, as it will have difficulty detecting them on time and taking evasive actions. 3. Compromised social interactions: Bats are known to be social creatures that use echolocation calls and other vocalizations for communication purposes. If a bat cannot produce sound waves, it may experience challenges in communicating with other bats, affecting its social relationships and group dynamics within the colony. 4. Adaptive consequences: In the long term, if a disruption in the bat's ability to make sound waves persists, it could lead to selective pressures on the affected bat population. Bats unable to use echolocation effectively would be at a disadvantage, as they would face challenges in acquiring food, avoiding predators, and reproducing. This could lead to reduced population sizes or perhaps adaptation of alternative strategies for navigation and foraging. In conclusion, the perturbation of a bat's ability to make sound waves would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the aforementioned process, compromising the bat's echolocation capabilities, and potentially leading to various challenges and dangers in its life-cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rick Norsigian Experts enlisted by the negatives' owner said the images were early works by Adams, famous for photographing the West. If authentic, they would represent rare works from the '20s and '30s. A set of 65 glass photographic negatives was identified Tuesday as vintage work of Ansel Adams by a team of experts enlisted by the owner, eliciting cries of skepticism. If authentic, the negatives, purchased for 45 at a garage sale 10 years ago, would represent a major addition to the body of work attributed to the iconic American photographer. A house painter claims that the 65 glass negatives he bought for 45 at a garage sale were made by Ansel Adams. According to a Beverly Hills art appraiser, they are worth 200 million. Lauren Schuker discusses. Also, Brett Arends discusses four market myths that won't die. But an heir who remains involved in curating Mr. Adams's work said he was doubtful. And Bill Turnage, the managing trustee of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, said he didn't believe the photographs were the work of Mr. Adams. \\"We don't think they look like Ansel's work,\\" he said. \\"Do you have any idea how many people were photographing Yosemite in the 1920s and 1930s? Millions! It could be anyone.\\" The experts included a photographer, an art adviser and handwriting analysts, though no Adams experts per se. They concluded that the negatives were early works by Mr. Adams, who died in 1984 at age 82 and is best known for his black-and-white photographs documenting landscapes of the American West. Some of Mr. Adams's work from the 1920s and 1930s was destroyed in a darkroom fire in 1937. The newly revealed negatives would represent rare works from that period. An appraiser estimated the negatives' value at around 200 million, though no plan to sell the collection has been announced. Garage Sale Find Take a look at some of the photos. View Slideshow Courtesy of Rick Norsigian \\"Aerial View of the Yosemite Valley\\" \\"The negatives aren't worth anything, even the 44,000 at the University of Arizona, because Ansel isn't around to print from them,\\" said Mr. Turnage of the Adams trust said. \\"The only authentic Ansel Adams works of art that are around are the ones that he printed.\\" Arnold Peter, a lawyer the negatives' owner hired to assemble the team of experts, said: \\"It is such an uninformed response on his part. Of course Ansel is no longer with us, and part of his magic is the way he developed photographs. But it doesn't make them any less valuable or mean that they are not worth anything. You can still produce great prints.\\" The trove was found a decade ago by Rick Norsigian, a 64-year-old building painter for the Fresno, Calif., public school system. Mr. Norsigian, who does not have a college degree, said in an interview he has never formally studied photography but collects antiques in his spare time. He noticed the negatives at a local garage sale initially because of their unusual material—they were made out glass rather than film—and bought them for 45 after negotiating down the 70 price tag. The 200 million estimate includes forecast sales, prints and other licensing arrangement, based on auction prices and previous sales of Adams works. The most expensive Adams work ever sold was \\"Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park,\\" from 1938, sold at Sotheby's in New York last month for 722,500. The second-most-expensive was the well-known \\"Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico,\\" which sold in October 2006 for 609,600, also at Sotheby's. Mr. Norsigian brought the negatives home and, over time, noticed that they resembled some of the photographs he had seen by Adams of Yosemite National Park. \\"My buddies would come over and we'd be having a beer and start making jokes: 'That looks like Ansel Adams,' \\" he recalled. \\"I had seen his work at hospitals, businesses, that kind of thing. I was never a big fan, but I got curious, So I went to the library and got a biography and started doing some research.\\" Seven years—and many biographies—later, Mr. Norsigian hired Mr. Peter. Mr. Peter said he and his team used handwriting analysis to show that the labels on envelopes encasing the negatives were written by the photographer's wife, Virginia. \\"We have plenty of evidence that clearly establishes that these negatives belong to Adams,\\" Mr. Peter said in an interview Tuesday. \\"There is really no dispute about it.\\" But Matthew Adams, the artist's grandson, who runs the Ansel Adams Gallery, said in an interview Tuesday that he remains \\"skeptical.\\" \\"All of the evidence presented is circumstantial at best,\\" Mr. Adams added in a lengthy statement, calling that evidence little more than \\"hopeful supposition.\\" He called the 200 million figure \\"ludicrous.\\" Mr. Adams said that one area of discrepancy emerges from misspellings on many of labels, presumably written by Virginia, who lived in Yosemite for much of her life. Mr. Adams said he was surprised that, after so many years in the region, she would misspell names such as Bridalveil, one of the most prominent waterfalls in the Yosemite Valley. Mr. Peter said such mistakes were often made in haste. \\"It's normal to have some typographical errors, and we've done extensive research to verify the handwriting,\\" he said. Mr. Adams said that when Mr. Peter presented images of the negatives and the evidence to him in November, he suggested using carbon dating to determine the period from when the negatives were made, but that procedure was never done. Mr. Peter said Tuesday that \\"there is really no reason to do carbon dating, because we have plenty of other evidence,\\" but added that he would consider it if Mr. Adams agreed that it would serve as definitive proof. Mr. Norsigian is currently storing the negatives in a vault in Fresno. Fresno State University will display the negatives in their first public showing in mid-October. Write to Lauren A. E. Schuker at lauren.schuker@wsj.com ||||| A wall painter for the Fresno school district who bought a cache of antique glass-plate photographic negatives at a garage sale 10 years ago laid out his case Tuesday that they were created by Ansel Adams early in his career, offering affirmations from photographic and forensic experts he had hired.In a Beverly Hills gallery packed with reporters and photographers, Rick Norsigian and the Beverly Hills law firm that is helping him market prints made from the negatives (and promote a documentary about his find) said the negatives of Yosemite, the San Francisco waterfront, and Carmel's mission and nearby Point Lobos were taken by Adams from 1919 to the 1930s, before he became famous as the visual bard of America's natural landscape.According to David W. Streets, the gallery owner who hosted the news conference and was part of a team of appraisers, the eventual yield from selling prints struck from Norsigian's find could amount to more than 200 million.But that sum and the flurry of publicity seemed absurd to dealers who have sold Adams' prints for millions of dollars, and to people from Adams' inner circle, including his grandson, Matthew Adams, and William Turnage, who was Adams' business manager until his death in 1984 and remains managing trustee in charge of administering the rights to publish or reproduce Adams' work.They pointedly question, if not outright dismiss, the conclusions Norsigian and his team have drawn. The evidence advanced Tuesday included handwriting on manila envelopes in which the negatives were found, and analyses of how the plates stack up physically, aesthetically and by subject with known Adams photographs from the period.\\"I really resent people who have gone out and hired some so-called experts. I give them no credence in terms of their knowledge of Ansel's work,\\" Turnage said. \\"They're doing this for only one thing, to make money. I feel sad for people who might be gulled into buying these things we think are fakes.\\"Even if the negatives did spring from Adams' camera, art-photography dealers say, any prints made from them will be essentially worthless in the collectors' market.It's not the negative that makes an Adams an Adams for the museums and private collectors who cherish his work and establish its market value, said Santa Monica dealer Peter Fetterman. It's the magic he worked in his darkroom to create the prints that bear the fruit of his artistry — not to mention his signature.A 1920s Adams negative developed in a 21st century darkroom by other hands just doesn't rate, agreed Andrew Smith, a Santa Fe art-photography dealer who says his gallery is America's busiest when it comes to reselling prints Adams made himself. \\"They just don't have much value. They weren't made by him.\\"Nevertheless, Norsigian and Arnold Peter, co-founder of the law firm that hired the experts and is helping Norsigian market what's billed as \\"The Lost Negatives of Ansel Adams,\\" said that Internet sales began a few days ago at http://www.lostnegatives.com for the first 17 images being offered. Limited edition prints hand-developed by North Carolina photographer Jesse Kalisher go for 7,500 each; digital prints cost 1,500, and for 45 you can get a poster.That compares to the record 722,500 paid last month at auction for \\"Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park,\\" and the 609,000 paid in 2006 for Adams' \\"Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico.\\"\\"If they were any good, he would have printed them,\\" Turnage said. \\"He printed everything that he felt was good. And [prints from Adams' hand] look completely different from what anybody they've hired to stamp out prints would make.\\"A 21-page summary of the Norsigian team's findings theorizes that the negatives survived a 1937 fire in Adams' studio, as suggested by scorch marks on some of them. Photography expert Patrick Alt of Los Angeles wrote that \\"it is very easy to imagine\\" that Norsigian's negatives were among the ones Adams' autobiography notes were saved by \\"throwing them in a bathtub filled with water.\\" Alt said that it was left to Adams' wife, Virginia, to write the identifying notes on the paper sleeves covering the negatives Norsigian bought 63 years later for about 75 cents each.Alt theorized that Adams brought the Norsigian negatives to Southern California in the early 1940s as examples for his students at what's now the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. \\"It would not be unreasonable for him to show the fire-damaged plates and regale his students with what was surely a great story,\\" Alt wrote. He added, \\"In almost all of the photographs, the compositions are virtually flawless,\\" indicating \\"a photographer of singular vision and talent.\\"Alt said the 6 1/2-by-8 1/2-inch negatives are consistent with what Adams is known to have used, and oxidation of the silver emulsion places the date they were taken at 70 years ago or more.Robert Moeller, a former curator of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, attested that, from the subjects and style, there is \\"a high degree of probability\\" that Adams took the pictures. Meteorologist George Wright compared the Norsigian photograph of a tree against a distant mountain backdrop with a known Adams photograph of the same tree and concluded that the cloud formation and snowcap prove they were taken at the same time. Handwriting experts Marcel Matley and Michael Nattenberg concluded that the writing on the envelopes matched samples from Virginia Adams.Matthew Adams, who is president of the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite, doubts that his grandmother, who grew up in Yosemite, would have committed the misspellings of prominent Yosemite place names he saw when Norsigian's team provided him with copies of some of the manila sleeves. Adams said she never would have written \\"Vail\\" instead of \\"Veil\\" in Bridal Veil Falls, \\"Washborn Point\\" instead of \\"Washburn Point,\\" or \\"Glaciar Point\\" instead of \\"Glacier Point.\\"\\"She would know Yosemite place names extremely well and she was literate and well-read,\\" Adams said. \\"And to claim that she was ignorant and made these kinds of errors, I don't see how that happened.\\"Norsigian attorney Peter said the misspellings are few, and likely the result of hasty writing as Virginia Adams tried to scrawl identifications on hundreds of envelopes containing negatives rescued from the 1937 fire. \\"The best spellers from time to time will make typographical errors.\\"Matthew Adams and Turnage said Adams was extremely cautious about his negatives, keeping them under lock and key when not using them to make prints. \\"There's no way on God's green earth that Ansel would have left 65 negatives sitting somewhere,\\" then lose track of them, Turnage said. \\"He treated the negatives as if they were his children,\\" going so far as to house them in a concrete bunker built into a hillside behind his home in Carmel — where nobody could venture unless accompanied by the photographer. Adams left all 44,000 of his negatives to the Center for Creative Photography, which he helped establish at the University of Arizona in Tucson , Turnage said.Norsigian and Peter said the documentary about the find will premiere in October at the fledgling Anaheim International Film Festival. The film also will be shown Oct. 14 at Cal State Fresno, along with prints of some of the photographs, as part of the university's centennial celebration. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In 2010, Rick Norsigian, a building painter, claimed that the set of 65 glass photographic negatives he purchased for 45 at a garage sale were the early works of renowned American photographer Ansel Adams.

Write the answer: Who played Lord Melchett in the TV comedy series Blackadder II?","completion":"Lord Melchett, a prominent character from the TV comedy series Blackadder II, was brilliantly portrayed by the talented British actor and comedian Stephen Fry. Blackadder II is the second series of the popular British television sitcom, created and written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton. The show originally aired on BBC1 from January 9, 1986, to February 20, 1986. Blackadder II is set in the Elizabethan era and is characterized by the witty, cunning, and sarcastic character Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson. Stephen Fry's portrayal of Lord Melchett added a unique charm to the series. Lord Melchett is a sniveling and obsequious courtier, always trying to please and stay in the good graces of Queen Elizabeth, played by Miranda Richardson. Positioned as one of the primary antagonist figures in the series, Fry's Melchett constantly locks horns with Blackadder throughout each episode, engaging in incessant power struggles. In later series of Blackadder, Fry played other roles too, such as General Melchett in Blackadder Goes Forth, a character whose similar-sounding name alludes to his portrayal of Lord Melchett in the previous series. Stephen Fry's impeccable comic timing and diverse acting skills contributed significantly to the success of Blackadder II and the entire Blackadder franchise. It is essential to note that Stephen Fry is not only known for his performances in Blackadder – the prolific actor and comedian has enjoyed an extensive and successful career in the entertainment industry. Other notable works of Fry include his performance in the renowned comedy duo Fry and Laurie with his long-time collaborator and friend Hugh Laurie, his portrayal of Oscar Wilde in the film 'Wilde,' hosting the popular quiz show QI, and providing the voice for the British version of the Harry Potter audiobooks. Overall, Fry's portrayal of Lord Melchett in Blackadder II remains an iconic characterization in the annals of British television comedy, and his contributions to the series helped to create a lasting legacy that continues to be enjoyed by audiences to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden? ? In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Q:What is the first name of the person who quits the band when Stevenson urges them to go on tour? Answer the above question based on the context below: The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

What is the difference between BH and MH curves in magnetism? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. Let me explain each one like you're a five-year-old: 1. SpaceX hype vs. Arianespace: Think of SpaceX as a cool new toy that does things differently than the older toys. SpaceX is getting lots of attention because they made rockets that can land back on Earth and be used again, making it cheaper and more eco-friendly. Arianespace is like an older, more experienced toy that has been sending lots of big things into space for a long time, but they don't reuse their rockets. People are excited about SpaceX because it's new, different, and could make space travel better in the future. 2. BH curve and MH curve in magnetism: Imagine you have a toy magnet. When you put this magnet near other magnets or metal things, they stick together – that's because of magnetism. Now, scientists and engineers use special graphs called curves to understand how magnets work. A BH curve shows how strong the magnetic force is in the magnet and an MH curve is about how much the magnet can 'hold' the magnetism inside it before it becomes too full. These two curves help them study and make better magnets for different purposes. So, the first question is about space and rockets, while the second question is about magnets and their properties.

Options: a ) 200 , b ) 220 , c ) 240 , d ) 180 , e ) 260 Output:","completion":"To solve this problem, let's follow these steps: Step 1: Define the variables. Let the distance from point y to point z be d. Then the distance from point x to point y is 2d. Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each segment. Time = Distance/Speed t(xy) = Time taken to travel from point x to point y = (2d) / 300 t(yz) = Time taken to travel from point y to point z = d / 100 Step 3: Calculate the total distance and total time taken. Total distance = Distance from x to y + Distance from y to z = 2d + d = 3d Total time = Time taken from x to y + Time taken from y to z = t(xy) + t(yz) Step 4: Calculate the average speed from point x to point z. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = (3d) / (t(xy) + t(yz)) = (3d) / ((2d/300) + (d/100)) Step 5: Simplify the expression. = (3d) / ((2d/300) + (3d/300)) = (3d) / ((2d + 3d) / 300)) = (3d) / (5d / 300) = (3d * 300) / 5d Step 6: Analyze the final expression.

On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Urdu/Punjabi: myN mHmd nwz shryf, born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani businessman and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2013 until he was disqualified for life from office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2017. He had previously served as the Prime Minister twice in the 90s (1990-93 and 1997-99) and the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. He is Pakistan's longest-serving prime minister. Born into the upper-middle class Sharif family in Lahore, he is the son of Ittefaq and Sharif Group founder, Muhammad Sharif, and the elder-brother of three-time elected Punjab Chief Minister, Shehbaz. Sharif was born in Lahore, Punjab on 25 December 1949. The Sharif family are Punjabis of Kashmiri origin. His father, Muhammad Sharif, was an upper-middle-class businessman and industrialist whose family had emigrated from Anantnag in Kashmir for business, and eventually settled in the village of Jati Umra in Amritsar district, Punjab, at the beginning of the twentieth century. His mother's family came from Pulwama. After the movement led by Jinnah and his struggle to create Pakistan in 1947, his parents migrated from Amritsar to Lahore. His father followed the teachings of the Ahl-i Hadith. His family owns Ittefaq Group, a multimillion-dollar steel conglomerate and Sharif Group, a conglomerate company with holdings in agriculture, transport and sugar mills. He is married to Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif, who is also descended from a Kashmiri family. His brother Shehbaz Sharif is the incumbent Chief Minister of Punjab province, while his nephew Hamza Shahbaz Sharif is a member of the National Assembly. His daughter Maryam Nawaz is currently the chairperson for the prime minister's youth initiative. Maryam is married to politician Muhammad Safdar Awan. His other daughter, Asma Nawaz, is married to Ali Dar, son of Ishaq Dar, the current finance minister of Pakistan. The personal residence of the Sharif family, Raiwind Palace, is located in Jati Umra, Raiwind, on the outskirts of Lahore. He also has a residence in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known as the Sharif Villa, where he lived during his years in exile. His elder son, Hussain Nawaz, is a businessman based in Saudi Arabia and currently resides in the Jeddah house. His younger son, Hassan Nawaz, is also a businessman and lives in London. He went to Saint Anthony High School. He graduated from the Government College University (GCU) with an art and business degree and then received a law degree from the Law College of Punjab University in Lahore. Sharif underwent heart surgery in May 2016 in London. It was his second open-heart operation. His deteriorating health forced him to undergo an open heart surgery only three days before the presentation of the country's annual budget. Many opposition leaders and the legal fraternity, including former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, raised questions about a possible constitutional crisis in Pakistan. Chaudhry called for electing a new interim Prime Minister to avoid the crisis. Sharif started his political career during the period of nationalization policies introduced by former Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Sharif family were financially devastated after the family steel business was nationalised, and Sharif jumped into national politics soon afterwards. In 1976 Sharif joined the Pakistan Muslim League, a conservative front rooted in the Punjab province. He initially focused on regaining control of his steel plants from the government. In May 1980 Ghulam Jilani Khan, the recently appointed Governor of the Punjab Province and a former Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), initiated a search for new urban leaders; Sharif was one of the men he found and promoted, quickly making him Finance Minister of the Punjab. In 1981, Sharif joined the Punjab Advisory Board under General Zia-ul-Haq and principally rose to public and political prominence as a staunch proponent of the military government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during the 1980s. He maintained close relations with Zia-ul-Haq, who soon agreed to return the steel mill which had been lost to nationalisation by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Sharif maintained an alliance with General Rahimuddin Khan, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. During his political career, Sharif also had close ties with the Director-General of ISI, Lieutenant-General (retired) Hamid Gul, who played a substantial role in the formation of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) - a conservative political alliance that supported Sharif. Sharif invested in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab countries in the Middle East to rebuild his steel empire. According to personal accounts and his time spent with Sharif, American historian Stephen Philips Cohen states in his book Idea of Pakistan: \\"Nawaz Sharif never forgave Bhutto after his steel empire was lost into the hands of Bhutto; and even after [Bhutto's] terrible end, Sharif publicly refused to forgive the soul of Bhutto or the Pakistan Peoples Party.\\" After coming to national power in 1990, Sharif attempted to reverse Bhutto's nationalisation policies, introducing an economy based on privatisation and economic liberalisation. Following the imposition and passing of the Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations on Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. A major international incident took place in the Middle East with Iraq invading the Kuwait which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Sharif contended with former Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg over the 1991 Gulf War (See Operation Desert Storm). Under the direction of General Beg, Pakistan Armed Forces actively participated in the conflict and the Army Special Service Group and the Naval Special Service Group were rushed to Saudi Arabia to provide intense security to Saudi royal family. Sharif also contended the upcoming Chief of Army Staff General Asif Nawaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Sharif, during his first term, found it difficult working with the PPP and the Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), a potent force in Karachi. The MQM and PPP opposed Sharif widely due to his focus on beautifying Punjab and Kashmir while neglecting Sindh. The MQM, a liberal force, also opposed Sharif's conservatism. The clash between liberalism and conservatism soon erupted forces in 1992 when political tension began to arise in which both party renegading ideological war against each other. Despite MQM had formed government with Sharif, more and more problems were mounted between Sharif and the MQM in 1992. Sharif's government members passed the resolution in the Parliament, to launch the paramilitary operation to end the cold war between PML-N and MQM. During this time, the centre left Pakistan Peoples Party remained quiet and neutral while watching the impact of the cold war between liberal and conservative forces. Prime minister Sharif also contended this upcoming operation with Chief of Army Staff General Asif Navaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Launched in 1992, violence erupted in Karachi and brought an economic halt in the country that dismantled Sharif's industrialisation and investment that was being brought by Sharif. Benazir Bhutto, during the course of this episode, remained silent as she too had opposed the MQM. His operation continued by Benazir also, but due to amid pressure exerted by her brother Murtaza Bhutto, the operation came to halt. The period of 1992-1994 is considered the bloodiest years in the history of the city, with many went missing. During his second term, Altaf Hussain decided to join with Sharif and tried to reach a compromise. Soon after the 1997 parliamentary elections, MQM joined with Sharif but this alliance fall apart following the assassination of Hakim Said. Therefore, the Prime minister kicked the MQM out of the government on immediate effect and assumed the control of Karachi. MQM was forced to continued its political activities underground. This action led Sharif to claim the exclusive mandate of entire Pakistan, and for the first time in his political career, Sharif and his party had the control of Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier, Kashmir and the Punjab Provinces.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What led to the surgery","completion":"Nawaz Sharif underwent heart surgery in May 2016 in London due to his deteriorating health.

This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

But it has the clearest and cleanest air. Amazingly, in this place, the sun sometimes hangs even in the midnight sky. This place is Antarctica : the coldest, windiest and harshest place on the Earth. As the world's least-known place, Antarctica is of great interest to scientists around the world. In 1983, China joined the Antarctic Treaty (<<>> ). The treaty made Antarctica a peaceful place for member countries to do scientific research. During 30 years, China has sent many scientists to Antarctica. They mostly look at the resources under the icy land and do research about climate change and marine biology. Antarctica is a place with fantastic views. However, life there is very hard. Food is one of the biggest problems. Frozen food which can be heated easily is people's daily food. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, scientists often eat dried or canned vegetables. Sleep is also troublesome. In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this period, Antarctica points to the sun and receives sunlight 24 hours a day. In order to get some sleep, scientists cover the windows with black plastic cloth to create \\"night\\". Working in Antarctica is dangerous, especially when meeting gale-force winds.Sometimes the wind is even stronger than a typhoon.It can easily blow people away.So there are ropes that connect buildings of some research stations.People can hold these ropes to keep their balance in forceful winds. What's more, communicating with others is difficult. Without cables and Internet in some research stations, two-way radios are the only tools to communicate. If people want to say hello to friends and relatives, they can use satellite phones. Although it is challenging to work in Antarctica, scientists' _ to learn about this mysterious land will never end. It is hopeful that one day they will step every corner of this icy land.

They were trying to speed up to get home because it looked like it was going to rain. Who was able to pull ahead of the other? (A) Jim (B) Bill","completion":"Based on the logic test presented, the answer your students should choose is (B) Bill. The test provides us with information about Jim and Bill, both riding their ATVs. Jim is pulling a trailer full of lemons, while Bill isn't pulling anything behind his ATV. They both try to speed up to get home before it starts raining. The question asks who was able to pull ahead of the other. Logically, we can analyze the situation using the concepts of force, mass, and acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). To increase their speeds, both Jim and Bill's ATVs need to exert a force. The more force they exert, the higher the acceleration they can achieve. However, the force produced by the ATVs is not only used to propel the ATVs forward; it is also used to overcome the forces of friction and air resistance. Additionally, in Jim's case, it also needs to overcome the additional weight and resistance posed by the trailer full of lemons. Since the mass of Jim's ATV, along with the trailer of lemons, is greater than the mass of Bill's ATV without any additional load, it means that the force generated by both their ATVs will result in a lower acceleration for Jim compared to Bill, assuming both ATVs exert the same amount of force. Taking all of this into account, it becomes clear that Bill, without any additional load to carry, will be able to achieve a higher speed and pull ahead of Jim, who is burdened with the extra weight of the trailer full of lemons. Therefore, the correct answer your students should choose is (B) Bill."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article:Wage campaigners argue that this does not equate to a \\"living wage\\" and have called for an increase to reflect the cost of living. Some politicians have been calling for a revision as well, with some cabinet ministers suggesting a 50p increase is needed. There are also suggestions that a minimum wage \\"top-up\\" in areas of high costs and higher average earnings could be introduced - paid for by employers. Labour politicians have also talked of backing a significant rise in the minimum wage, but without specific figures- and of having a higher \\"minimum\\" in some sectors of the economy. What is the national UK minimum wage, and who gets it? The minimum wage depends on age and whether the employee is an apprentice. Only those of school leaving age or above are eligible. It currently stands at £6.31 for the over-21s (a rate which was increased on 1 October 2013 by 12p an hour.) Those aged 18-20 must be paid £5.03 an hour, while under-18s receive £3.72 and apprentices must get £2.68. The minimum wage was introduced by Labour in 1999, at a rate of £3.60 an hour for the over-22s. Workers under the age of 22 were to be paid £3 an hour. Do employers have an obligation to pay at least these amounts? Yes. All employers must pay workers at least the minimum wage. Recently it was announced that employers who fail to pay workers the national minimum wage will face tougher penalties. The maximum fine for anyone failing to pay the statutory level will increase from £5,000 to £20,000 in February 2014. The government also plans to \\"name and shame\\" companies which do not pay the right levels. How is the minimum wage level decided? The National Minimum Wage Act of 1998 created a minimum wage across the United Kingdom. It was part of the 1997 general election Labour Party manifesto. Each year, the rates are reviewed by the Low Pay Commission, which is an independent body. It reports to the government in February. The commission makes recommendations to the government, which sets the rate. It is enforced by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The secretary of state can make exceptions under the National Minimum Wage Act, and has for au pairs, who are not entitled to the National Minimum Wage. The Low Pay Commission carries out surveys to research pay and other factors. It consults employers and looks at economic data from the Office of National Statistics before making its recommendations. What is the 'living wage'? Many groups and politicians - including Business Secretary Vince Cable - argue that the current minimum wage isn't high enough. Others have sought a so-called \\"living wage\\" for employees, arguing the minimum wage does not reflect the real costs of living, especially in the capital. The Living Wage Foundation argues that companies should pay £7.45 an hour in the UK as a whole and £8.55 in London. Both London's former and current Mayor, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, are supporters. The Greater London Authority (GLA) is among the organisations that pay the living wage to their employees. The living wage is currently calculated by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, while the London living wage has been calculated by the GLA since 2005. How much do UK workers earn? In the year ending April 2013, the ONS said UK pre-tax pay reached £27,000 a year, an increase of 2.1% over 2012. That is a below-inflation increase for that period. The ONS said in December 2013, the average hourly earnings before tax for UK workers were £13.60 for men and £12.24 for women. In April 2013, 10% of full-time employees earned less than £7.28 per hour (excluding overtime), an increase of 1.5% compared with the previous year. Based on an eight-hour day, five days a week without overtime, someone earning the adult national minimum wage would make £12,115.20p a year. After tax, that would be £11,055.96 a year. How many people in the UK do minimum wage jobs? The Low Pay Commission estimates that there are 1,386,000 minimum wage jobs. Nearly half (46%) of all low-wage workers are employed in two sectors: wholesale and retail, and hotels and restaurants. About three-quarters of a million minimum-wage jobs are accounted for by hospitality, retail and cleaning. How do the UK's wages compare internationally? The UK has the second-highest rate of low pay in the OECD and twice the rate in some other advanced countries. Last year, figures requested by the Labour Party and collated by the House of Commons library showed average hourly UK wages had fallen 5.5% since mid-2010, adjusted for inflation. That is the fourth-worst decline among the 27 EU nations. Over the same time, German hourly wages rose by 2.7%. Only Greek, Portuguese and Dutch workers have had a steeper decline in hourly wages, the figures showed. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The national UK minimum wage varies depending on age and whether the employee is an apprentice, with those aged over-21 earning £6.31 per hour.

Lothair was walking on the terrace, his favorite walk, for it was the duly occasion on which he ever found himself alone. Not that he had any reason to complain of his companions.

And yet, during all their travels, Lothair felt that he never was alone. This was remarkable at the great cities, such as Messina and Palermo, but it was a prevalent habit in less-frequented places. There was a petty town near them, which he had never visited alone, although he had made more than one attempt with that view; and it was only on the terrace in the early morn, a spot whence he could be observed from the villa, and which did not easily communicate with the precipitous and surrounding scenery, that Lothair would indulge that habit of introspection which he had pursued through many a long ride, and which to him was a never-failing source of interest and even excitement.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Answer: \\"Settled in St. Ann's Bay\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is not correct based on the paragraph.

Therefore, the hypothesis \\"She's never been to a hospital\\" contradicts the information provided in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Aubrey slammed the door at the annoying salesmen that would never leave. Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"strong\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"In order to determine if \\"strong\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" after Aubrey's interaction with the annoying salesmen, it is important to analyze the context of the situation and break down the components of the answer. First, let us understand the situation in which Aubrey slams the door at the annoying salesmen who would never leave. A response like this typically indicates a sense of frustration or annoyance within the individual, which in this case, is Aubrey. By slamming the door, Aubrey is physically and metaphorically severing any further interaction or communication with the salesmen, expressing her unwillingness to entertain their persistence. Now, let's consider the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\". This question seeks to predict or make an inference about the actions of other parties involved in the situation. In this context, \\"Others\\" refers to the salesmen outside of Aubrey's door. The answer we are evaluating is \\"strong\\". The word 'strong' typically refers to physical strength or the level of intensity regarding a feeling or opinion. It could also imply determination or assertiveness. This may not directly relate to the next course of action or motive of the salesmen. We can, however, infer several possibilities for the salesmen's next move based on their interaction with Aubrey: 1. Regroup and strategize: The salesmen might want to approach their sales pitch differently after seeing Aubrey's strong reaction. They may discuss and try to come up with a better approach for the next potential customer. 2. Leave and move on: Realizing that Aubrey is not interested in their product or service, the salesmen may decide to continue to the next house or area without further attempting to convince her. 3. Reflect on the situation: The salesmen might pause and assess their sales tactics so far, reflecting on whether their persistence and approach has been causing others to respond negatively, like Aubrey. It is clear that \\"strong\\" as an answer does not directly provide a prediction or inferential conclusion about the next steps for the salesmen following Aubrey's reaction. Therefore, it cannot be considered a valid answer to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\". A more appropriate answer might be something along the lines of: \\"The salesmen, after being faced with Aubrey's frustration, might choose to re-evaluate their approach, move on to the next potential client, or reflect on their tactics to improve future interactions.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. The state borders South Carolina and Georgia to the south, Tennessee to the west, Virginia to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

Question: ho does Sidney double cross? Movie title: Deathtrap Movie plot: Famed playwright Sidney Bruhl (Caine) debuts the latest in a series of Broadway flops and returns to his opulent Long Island home and his wife, Myra (Cannon). Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is hungry for a hit. He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and now asks for input on his play. Sidney suggests that he murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. He invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from Sidney's plays, to discuss it. Clifford (Reeve) arrives by train. Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors.

A:","completion":"Based on the movie plot you provided, Sidney does not double-cross anyone directly. However, he does betray his wife, Myra, by suggesting that he murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. This act can be considered an indirect double-crossing of Myra, as he goes against her attempts to convince him to work with Clifford as equal partners. Furthermore, it appears that Sidney and Clifford double-cross Myra when they stage the attack and Clifford's supposed murder. They deceive Myra into believing that Sidney has actually killed Clifford, which directly contributes to her weak heart giving out when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and chases her around the house. In summary, although Sidney does not double-cross anyone directly, his betrayal of Myra indirectly contributes to her death and can be seen as a form of double-crossing. Additionally, the calculated deception by both Sidney and Clifford further contributes to the overall sense of manipulation and betrayal present throughout the film. It is crucial to consider all these factors when deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, given that these elements play a significant role in the movie's suspense and dramatic tension."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alfredo Martínez, D.Pharm., M.D., Ph.D. Miguel A. Martínez-González, M.D., Ph.D. University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain [email protected] This letter was published on June 13, 2018, at NEJM.org. Editor’s note: An analysis of reports of randomized trials for improbable distributions of baseline data included 934 reports published in the Journal and identified 11 with distributions of baseline variables that did not appear consistent with randomization (Carlisle JB. Anaesthesia 2017;72:944-52. DOI: 10.1111/anae.13938. Epub 2017 June 4). We reviewed these 11 trial reports and replicated the Carlisle analysis. In 5 reports, standard errors were inadvertently reported as standard deviations, or vice versa. These errors explained the findings and have been corrected; the 5 reports are as follows: High-Dose Atorvastatin after Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (N Engl J Med 2006;355:549-59), Treatment of Periodontitis and Endothelial Function (N Engl J Med 2007;356:911-20), Extended Antiretroviral Prophylaxis to Reduce Breast-Milk HIV-1 Transmission (N Engl J Med 2008;359:119-29), Effect of Bronchoconstriction on Airway Remodeling in Asthma (N Engl J Med 2011;364:2006-15), and Horse versus Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin in Acquired Aplastic Anemia (N Engl J Med 2011;365:430-8). For 5 other reports, limitations in the Carlisle analysis, such as lack of accounting for correlation among baseline variables, most likely explained the findings. For the remaining report, Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet (N Engl J Med 2013;368:1279-90), the authors’ subsequent review of their data and randomization procedures identified protocol deviations, including the enrollment of participants who were not randomized. The authors have therefore withdrawn their original report (Retraction and Republication: Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet. N Engl J Med 2013;368:1279-90. N Engl J Med. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1806491). The Journal has now published their new report of the study, which describes the protocol deviations and reports reanalyses of the data (Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet Supplemented with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil or Nuts. N Engl J Med. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1800389). ||||| Study Design The PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) was a parallel-group, multicenter, randomized trial. Details of the trial design are provided elsewhere.10-12 The trial was designed and conducted by the authors, and the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at all study locations. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and all analyses and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Supplemental foods were donated, including extra-virgin olive oil (by Hojiblanca and Patrimonio Comunal Olivarero, both in Spain), walnuts (by the California Walnut Commission), almonds (by Borges, in Spain), and hazelnuts (by La Morella Nuts, in Spain). None of the sponsors had any role in the trial design, data analysis, or reporting of the results. Participant Selection and Randomization Eligible participants were men (55 to 80 years of age) and women (60 to 80 years of age) with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, who had either type 2 diabetes mellitus or at least three of the following major risk factors: smoking, hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, overweight or obesity, or a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Detailed enrollment criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. All participants provided written informed consent. Beginning on October 1, 2003, participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one of three dietary intervention groups: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Randomization was performed centrally by means of a computer-generated random-number sequence. Interventions and Measurements Table 1. Table 1. Summary of Dietary Recommendations to Participants in the Mediterranean-Diet Groups and the Control-Diet Group. The dietary intervention8,10-13 is detailed in the Supplementary Appendix. The specific recommended diets are summarized in Table 1. Participants in the two Mediterranean-diet groups received either extra-virgin olive oil (approximately 1 liter per week) or 30 g of mixed nuts per day (15 g of walnuts, 7.5 g of hazelnuts, and 7.5 g of almonds) at no cost, and those in the control group received small nonfood gifts. No total calorie restriction was advised, nor was physical activity promoted. For participants in the two Mediterranean-diet groups, dietitians ran individual and group dietary-training sessions at the baseline visit and quarterly thereafter. In each session, a 14-item dietary screener was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet8,14 (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) so that personalized advice could be provided to the study participants in these groups. Participants in the control group also received dietary training at the baseline visit and completed the 14-item dietary screener used to assess baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Thereafter, during the first 3 years of the trial, they received a leaflet explaining the low-fat diet (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) on a yearly basis. However, the realization that the more infrequent visit schedule and less intense support for the control group might be limitations of the trial prompted us to amend the protocol in October 2006. Thereafter, participants assigned to the control diet received personalized advice and were invited to group sessions with the same frequency and intensity as those in the Mediterranean-diet groups, with the use of a separate 9-item dietary screener (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). A general medical questionnaire, a 137-item validated food-frequency questionnaire,15 and the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire were administered on a yearly basis.10 Information from the food-frequency questionnaire was used to calculate intake of energy and nutrients. Weight, height, and waist circumference were directly measured.16 Biomarkers of compliance, including urinary hydroxytyrosol levels (to confirm compliance in the group receiving extra-virgin olive oil) and plasma alpha-linolenic acid levels (to confirm compliance in the group receiving mixed nuts), were measured in random subsamples of participants at 1, 3, and 5 years (see the Supplementary Appendix). End Points The primary end point was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary end points were stroke, myocardial infarction, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause. We used four sources of information to identify end points: repeated contacts with participants, contacts with family physicians, a yearly review of medical records, and consultation of the National Death Index. All medical records related to end points were examined by the end-point adjudication committee, whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments. Only end points that were confirmed by the adjudication committee and that occurred between October 1, 2003, and December 1, 2010, were included in the analyses. The criteria for adjudicating primary and secondary end points are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix. Statistical Analysis We initially estimated that a sample of 9000 participants would be required to provide statistical power of 80% to detect a relative risk reduction of 20% in each Mediterranean-diet group versus the control-diet group during a 4-year follow-up period, assuming an event rate of 12% in the control group.10,17 In April 2008, on the advice of the data and safety monitoring board and on the basis of lower-than-expected rates of end-point events, the sample size was recalculated as 7400 participants, with the assumption of a 6-year follow-up period and underlying event rates of 8.8% and 6.6% in the control and intervention groups, respectively. Power curves under several assumptions can be found in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. Yearly interim analyses began after a median of 2 years of follow-up. With the use of O'Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries, the P values for stopping the trial at each yearly interim analysis were 5×10−6, 0.001, 0.009, and 0.02 for benefit and 9×10−5, 0.005, 0.02, and 0.05 for adverse effects.18 The stopping boundary for the benefit of the Mediterranean diets with respect to the primary end point was crossed at the fourth interim evaluation; on July 22, 2011, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial on the basis of end points documented through December 1, 2010. All primary analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis by two independent analysts. Time-to-event data were analyzed with the use of Cox models with two dummy variables (one for the Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and another for the Mediterranean diet with nuts) to obtain two hazard ratios for the comparison with the control group. To account for small imbalances in risk factors at baseline among the groups, Cox regression models were used to adjust for sex, age, and baseline risk factors. We tested the proportionality of hazards with the use of time-varying covariates. All analyses were stratified according to center. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted according to sex, age, body-mass index (BMI), cardiovascular-risk-factor status, and baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Sensitivity analyses were conducted under several assumptions, including imputation of data for missing values and participants who dropped out (see the Supplementary Appendix). ||||| Errors Trigger Retraction Of Study On Mediterranean Diet's Heart Benefits Enlarge this image toggle caption Westend61/Getty Images Westend61/Getty Images Ask just about anybody, and you'll probably hear that a healthy diet is one full of fruits and vegetables, olive oil, nuts and fish — what's called Mediterranean diet. A lot of research has suggested people who eat this way tend to be healthier, but it's been harder to prove whether that is because of the diet or some other factor. So in 2013, many took notice of a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that seemed to provide some proof. The study found that people eating the Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil were 30 percent less likely to experience a heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes than people assigned to a low-fat diet. People who stuck with a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts had a 28 percent lower risk than those asked to follow a low-fat diet. The results got wide media attention, including from NPR. But the New England Journal of Medicine retracted the paper Wednesday because of problems in the way the study was carried out. A retraction is a last resort for medical and scientific journals, a sign to readers that the results are no longer trustworthy and are beyond correcting. Although retractions are relatively rare — taking down fewer than 1 in 1,000 published articles — the rate is increasing. The authors of the NEJM paper are replacing the 2013 paper with a corrected version that shows people following the diet had a similarly reduced level of heart attacks and strokes. The major change is softer language about the conclusions. The revised paper says only that people eating the Mediterranean diet had fewer strokes and heart attacks, not, as the original paper claimed, that the diet was the direct cause of those health benefits. Of course, a change in one paper — even a high-profile one — doesn't mean that researchers have lost faith in the benefits of the Mediterranean diet. \\"I don't know anybody who would turn around from this and say, 'Now that this has been revealed, we should all eat cotton candy and turn away from the Mediterranean diet,' \\" says David Allison, dean of the School of Public Health at Indiana University in Bloomington. Still, without the strong language touting the benefits of the diet in the original paper, \\"the legs have been kicked out from under it, in some sense,\\" says Allison, a longtime nutrition researcher whose research has at times been partially funded by the food industry. What prompted the Mediterranean diet researchers to soften their language? A persistent British anesthesiologist named John Carlisle. He knew very little about analyzing the details behind clinical trials until a few years ago, when he wrote a letter to an anesthesiology journal bemoaning the fact that his field was polluted by one researcher's data that many suspected were problematic. The journal editor told Carlisle, a practicing anesthesiologist at Torbay Hospital in Torquay, England, to prove it. So Carlisle did. He read up on statistical methods and looked over more than 160 trials by the researcher, Dr. Yoshitaka Fujii, and analyzed how likely it was that the people had been randomized to different treatments. Randomization is part of the gold standard for clinical studies because it reduces the risk of bias and allows researchers to determine cause-effect relationships. Carlisle found the odds were infinitesimally small that Fujii had randomized people properly. Since Carlisle's findings were published in 2012, medical journals have retracted more than 160 papers by Fujii — the most retractions for any one researcher, by a large margin, according to Retraction Watch. Carlisle's analysis drew accolades — and added him to the ranks of a small but growing number of such sleuths. The success of the approach prompted Carlisle to expand his scope to include randomized trials from other researchers and in other fields. After the Fujii paper, he spent two years applying the \\"Carlisle method\\" to thousands of clinical trials published in eight journals. In 2017, he reported that roughly 2 percent showed signs of problems. Among the more than 5,000 trials Carlisle analyzed, 934 were published by the New England Journal of Medicine. He flagged 11. One was the 2013 study showing the Mediterranean diet was responsible for the reduced rates of heart attack and stroke. Today, NEJM is replacing the 2013 study and correcting five others on different topics. The Mediterranean diet paper is being retracted because it turns out Carlisle was correct. When the lead author of the paper, Dr. Miguel Ángel Martínez González of the University of Navarra Medical School, saw Carlisle's analysis, he conducted a detailed audit of the study and quickly noticed some problems. It turns out approximately 14 percent of the more than 7,400 study participants hadn't been assigned randomly to either the Mediterranean diet or a low-fat one. When couples joined the study together, both had been picked to follow the same diet. At one of the 11 participating study sites, the lead investigator had assigned the same diet to an entire village and didn't tell the rest of the investigators. \\"This affected only a small part of the trial,\\" says Martínez González. When the researchers reanalyzed the data excluding the nonrandomized people, the results were the same, he adds. Still, because everybody wasn't randomly assigned to different groups, the study can no longer claim the diet directly caused those health benefits. \\"We need to tone down the results, but it is just a little bit,\\" he says. Many other studies have shown that people eating the Mediterranean diet have lower risks of various ailments, without claiming cause and effect. But would the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world's most selective and prestigious journals, have published the Mediterranean diet paper from Martínez González if the randomization issues and softened conclusion had been included in the first place? \\"It is difficult to answer hypothetical questions,\\" New England Journal of Medicine spokeswoman Jennifer Zeis says. \\"We believe the evidence [in favor of the diet] is still strong, but not as strong as a randomized study in which the randomization was executed flawlessly.\\" Carlisle praised the journal's response. \\"I think that the NEJM editorial team responded very maturely to my paper,\\" he says. \\"They took the possibility of a problem seriously and acted quickly and thoroughly.\\" Alison McCook is the editor of Retraction Watch, a website that reports on scientific retractions and related issues.

Martínez-González Credit via Wikimedia Commons An omission like that erodes the randomized nature of the trial. Family members are likely to share more than just a diet: If a husband and wife both dodge heart disease, it’s difficult to say that their diet is the only reason. In their re-analysis, the investigators statistically adjusted data on 390 people who happened to be household members but whose diets were not randomly assigned. Then the investigators discovered another problem. A researcher at one of the 11 clinical centers in the trial worked in small villages. Participants there complained that some neighbors were receiving free olive oil, while they got only nuts or inexpensive gifts. So the investigator decided to give everyone in each village the same diet. He never told the leaders of the study what he had done. “He did not think it was important,” Dr. Martínez-González said. But the decision meant that participants were not truly randomized and forced Dr. Martínez-González and his colleagues to make another statistical adjustment to data on 652 people in the trial. The investigators spent a year working on the re-analysis in collaboration with Dr. Miguel Hernan of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In the end, they concluded that the original findings were still accurate. “You cannot imagine what it has been like,” Dr. Martínez-González said, adding that he and his team worked through vacations and weekends — and swallowed considerable professional embarrassment. |||||Summary:","completion":"The New England Journal of Medicine recently retracted an article on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, after concerns were raised about the randomization procedures of the study. The article, which argued that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts could lead to the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, had used data from more than 7,000 participants. The researchers have since re-analysed the data and published a new report that tones down the initial health benefit claims, but still maintains that the Mediterranean diet can lead to lower rates of heart attack and stroke."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge? Answer the above question based on the context below: Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head \\" because Patrick had tried to shoot him , \\" according to an arrest warrant released Tuesday . According to an arrest warrant released Tuesday , Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head \\" because Patrick had tried to shoot him . \\"","completion":"Yes, the two sentences have the same meaning, but they are structured differently. Both sentences convey the same information: Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head because Patrick had tried to shoot him, and this information came from an arrest warrant released on Tuesday. The difference between the two sentences lies in the order of the information presented and the syntactic structure used. In the first sentence, the main clause is \\"Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head 'because Patrick had tried to shoot him,'\\" and the secondary information, \\"according to an arrest warrant released Tuesday,\\" is placed at the end of the sentence. This structure emphasizes the action of Dotson admitting his actions to the FBI agents and the reason behind the shooting. In the second sentence, the information about the arrest warrant being released on Tuesday is shifted to the beginning of the sentence. By starting with \\"According to an arrest warrant released Tuesday,\\" the author places greater emphasis on the source of the information and establishes a context before presenting the main information. The main clause about Dotson's admission and the reason behind the shooting remains the same. In summary, while both sentences convey the same meaning, the difference in their structures emphasizes different aspects of the information – the first sentence puts more focus on Dotson's action and the reason for the shooting, while the second sentence highlights the source and context of the information. Regardless of their syntactic differences, the core meaning remains the same between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: The United States and Afghanistan have reached a deal on the final language of a bilateral security agreement, guiding the role of American troops in that south Asian nation for years to come, America's top diplomat said Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. \\"They have to pass it,\\" Kerry said. \\"... It's up to the people of Afghanistan.\\" If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last \\"until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated\\" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false. The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting \\"Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\\" and adds U.S. forces \\"shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes.\\" But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting \\"it's just not even on the table.\\" \\"I don't know where the idea of an apology started,\\" Kerry said. \\"President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever.\\" The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that \\"U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism.\\" \\"U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support (the Afghan military's) counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining (the Afghan military's) lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes,\\" the tentative deal states. Mine blast kills seven -- and they were all children. The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military \\"shall have the exclusive right\\" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have \\"a very limited mission\\" and would not be \\"patrolling cities or mountains.\\" \\"The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised,\\" Carney said. \\"The combat mission will be over.\\" Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan \\"very limited,\\" adding \\"it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist\\" Afghan forces. The language in the proposed security agreement, in fact, speaks to that point: \\"Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan.\\" Report: Opium poppy cultivation rises to new levels in Afghanistan.

Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples: 1. Captain Morgan The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame 2.

For this colorful project, we'll need a few things and follow some simple steps. What we need: 1. Yarn: made from wool or other animal fibers 2. Dye: We'll use food coloring because it's safe and easy to find 3. Vinegar: This helps the dye stick to the yarn 4. Warm water 5. A large bowl or container 6. Gloves (so your hands don't get too colorful!) 7. Plastic wrap or a microwave-safe plate 8. Microwave or a heat source (ask an adult for help) Here's what we'll do step by step: 1. Soak the yarn: Fill the bowl with warm water and a little bit of vinegar. Put the yarn in the water and let it soak for at least 30 minutes. This helps the yarn become friends with the dye later. 2. Prepare the dye: While the yarn is soaking, mix a few drops of food coloring with some warm water and vinegar in a separate container. You can use your favorite color, or mix colors to make a new one! Make sure it's well mixed. 3. Remove the yarn: After soaking, gently take the yarn out of the bowl and slightly squeeze out the extra water, but don't twist or wring it. You want it to be damp, not too wet. 4. Time for color: Now, wearing gloves, slowly pour the dye mix onto the yarn, making sure you get the color where you want it. You can use your hands to move the dye around. Remember, it's okay if it's not perfect because that makes it unique! 5. Let it soak: Once the yarn is covered in the dye, let it soak for a bit. The longer you let the yarn soak, the stronger the color will be. 6. Cook the yarn: To set the dye, ask an adult to place the yarn on plastic wrap or a microwave-safe plate, and then put it in the microwave. Heat it up for 1-2 minutes, checking every 30 seconds to avoid burning. Be careful; it might be hot! 7. Cool and rinse: Let the yarn cool down. When it's not too hot to touch, rinse it under cold water until the water runs clear. Gently squeeze out any extra water. 8. Time to dry: Hang the yarn up to dry. Once it's completely dry, your colorful yarn is ready for you to use in any fun craft project! Remember, it's important to have a grown-up help you with the heating part and always be careful when using dye so you don't make a mess.

Hard law is generally associated with legally binding agreements, such as treaties, which are traditionally considered hard law by default. In contrast, soft law often consists of non-binding guidelines, frameworks, or principles that all parties agree to abide by without a legally enforceable requirement. One way to distinguish between the two is to consider enforceability. If an agreement or document has enforceable obligations or consequences for non-compliance, it is likely to be classified as hard law.

When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others.

The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\".

Question: suppose more people work on building satellites happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If more people work on building satellites, it is likely to have more effect on the development and deployment of smaller satellites rather than less. This increased workforce in the satellite industry would potentially lead to a higher number of new satellites being developed and launched into space. With advancements in technology and the growing interest in small satellites, more people in the industry may result in a quicker development of smaller and more efficient satellite designs. The second effect mentioned is the supposed perturbation (unintended disruption or disturbance) caused by the increase in satellite development and launches. With more small satellites being developed and launched into space, there is likely to be an increase in the potential for perturbations caused by factors such as space debris, radio frequency interference, and increased satellite density in the low Earth orbits. In conclusion, more people working on building satellites would likely lead to more (the first effect) development and deployment of smaller satellites.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP).\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What makes zinc an efficient sacrificial anode?\\" Select from: a). yes; b). no;","completion":"a). Yes, the sentence \\"The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP).\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What makes zinc an efficient sacrificial anode?\\". Let's break this down further to elaborate on the reasons that support this claim. First, it is essential to establish what cathodic protection (CP) is, as it aids in understanding the context of the question. Cathodic protection is an electrochemical technique designed to counteract corrosion in metal structures, such as pipelines, storage tanks, and other infrastructure elements. It operates by rendering the protected structure cathodic, thereby inhibiting anodic (oxidation) processes that lead to corrosion. Now, let's look at zinc as a material for creating sacrificial anodes. In a sacrificial anode system, a more reactive (easily oxidized) metal is linked to the structure to be protected. When the system is submerged in an electrolyte (such as seawater or soil), the more reactive metal corrodes preferentially, sacrificing itself and preventing corrosion on the primary structure. Zinc is a particularly efficient sacrificial anode for several reasons: 1. Relative reactivity: Compared to other metals, zinc has a higher rate of reactivity. Due to its position in the electrochemical series, it stands higher than iron and steel, making it ideal for safeguarding these materials from corrosion. Its higher reactivity means that zinc will corrode first in the presence of an electrolyte, shielding the primary metal structure. 2. Ability to attract oxidation: Zinc's chemical properties allow it to form a stable oxide layer that can protect its underlying layers from further corrosion. As zinc attracts oxidation to itself, it consumes the oxidizing agents before they can reach the protected metal structure. This self-sacrificing behavior is the main reason behind zinc's efficiency as a sacrificial anode. 3. Electrochemical properties: When submerged in an electrolyte, zinc can effectively transfer electrons between itself and the protected metallic structure, enabling the protection process. This electron exchange reduces the corrosion rate of the primary structure and prolongs its lifespan. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Zinc is relatively inexpensive compared to other sacrificial anode materials such as magnesium or aluminum. This factor enables the widespread application of zinc sacrificial anodes in the corrosion protection industry. In summary, the sentence provided is a valid answer to the question as it precisely explains the fundamental reasons behind zinc's efficiency as a sacrificial anode: its relative reactivity and ability to attract oxidation to itself. This information showcases why zinc is commonly employed in cathodic protection systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Closing in on a planet, the ship is attacked by a mysterious weapon (a red blobby field) which drives the crew insane. Three escape pods launch during the attack, but the ship crashes into the atmosphere of the planet and is destroyed. Meanwhile, smuggler Stella Star and her sidekick Akton run into the Imperial Space Police, led by robot sheriff Elle. Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who tracked their hyperspace trail. Tried and convicted of piracy, they are each sentenced to life in prison on separate prison planets. When a riot breaks out at Stella's prison, she uses the diversion to escape the prison, which explodes shortly afterwards.

Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 - September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called \\"The Boy Wonder\\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Good Earth. His films carved out an international market, \\"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\\" states biographer Roland Flamini. Thalberg was born in Brooklyn, to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann). Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with \\"blue baby syndrome,\\" caused by a congenital disease that limited the oxygen supply to his heart. The prognosis from the family's doctor and specialists was that he might live to age twenty, or at most, age thirty. During his high school years in Brooklyn, he began having attacks of chest pains, dizziness and fatigue. This affected his ability to study, though until that time he was a good student. When he was 17, he contracted rheumatic fever, and was confined to bed for a year. His mother, Henrietta, to prevent him falling too far behind other students, brought him homework from school, books, and tutors to teach him at home. She also hoped that the schoolwork and reading would distract him from the \\"tantalizing sounds\\" of children playing outside his window. With little to entertain him, he read books as a main activity. He devoured popular novels, classics, plays, and biographies. His books, of necessity, replaced the streets of New York, and led to his interest in classical philosophy and philosophers, such as William James. When Thalberg returned to school, he finished high school but lacked the stamina for college, which he felt would have required constant late-night studying and cramming for exams. Instead, he took part-time jobs as a store clerk, and in the evenings, to gain some job skills, taught himself typing, shorthand and Spanish at a night vocational school. When he turned 18, he placed an ad with the local newspaper hoping to find better work: \\"Situation Wanted: Secretary, stenographer, Spanish, English, high school education, no experience; 15.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: where did he grow up","completion":"Irving Thalberg grew up in Brooklyn, as mentioned in the passage: \\"Thalberg was born in Brooklyn, to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann).\\""}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},z={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
