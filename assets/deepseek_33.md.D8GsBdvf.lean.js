There is a special thing called enamel in teeth. It is the hardest thing in the human body and keeps bacteria away. However, teeth are hurt easily to problems and disease. September 20 is National Teeth-loving Day in China. Let's pay attention to the health of our teeth. Teeth problems are common around the world. Most children and young adults have tooth decay . A study which come out on China Health Monthly magazine this year showed that 40.74% of a sample of 1,306 Chinese students under age 15 has decayed teeth. Food that is rich in sugar increases the risk of tooth decay. After you eat, bacteria go crazy over the sugar on your teeth. The bacteria turn sugar into acids that eat away at tooth enamel. This causes holes in your teeth. Another common problem is crooked teeth . When your new teeth begin to grow and the old teeth haven't fallen out, there isn't enough space for the new ones. This causes crooked teeth. Don't worry. Here are some ways to keep your teeth healthy. *Brush at least twice a day in the morning and in the evening. *Learn to use dental floss . The floss gets rid of food that's hidden where your toothbrush can't get it. *Visit a dentist. He or she can check if you have any dental problems and help you clean your teeth. *Pay attention to what you eat.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

An empty piece of land on the world-renowned Sandbanks peninsula has gone on the market for £6.25million – more than the price of a 38-bedroom castle in the Scottish Highlands. The muddy plot, the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market, is now priced at £2m more than when it came with two houses. Despite being empty, the plot is the same price as an entire estate on the south shore of Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, which includes a castle, a swimming pool, 12 extra villas or bungalows, a sports hall, a golf course, a shooting range and an army assault course. If it sold at the asking price, the plot - which measures 27m by 18m - will equate to a staggering £1,161 per square foot. Scroll down for video. This narrow empty plot of land in the world-renowned Sandbanks area has gone on the market for a staggering £6.25million. The plot, the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market, is now priced at £2m more than when it came with two houses. The area, which measures 27m by 18m and already has planning permission, will equate to £1,161 per square feet if it sells for the asking price. But looking at it from another point of view - literally - it's perhaps easy to see why the small area has gone on the market for such an eye-watering sum. The reason that the sliver of land is set to fetch such an eye-watering sum is because it backs onto the beach and is located on the narrowest part of the peninsula, meaning that it boasts two-way views, including over Poole Harbour. A property two doors down holds the record for the most expensive house on the peninsula per square foot. The detached house sold last year for £3.45million, which worked out as £1,725 per square foot. Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property and counts Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie among its residents. Prices in the area have soared in the past few years, with prospective buyers even able to get more for their money in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Mayfair. At the moment, £6.75million could give buyers a two-bedroom flat, within spitting distance of Hyde Park. The latest plot in the exclusive resort has gone on the market after the owner decided to stay put in the house he currently rents. The owner initially bought the land, which included two 1960s houses, with the intention of building his dream home in their place. But while the planning application was being considered, he fell in love with the property he was living in and decided to remain there. He went ahead with knocking down the two houses on the Sandbanks plot, later securing permission for two four-bed houses, complete with their own gym and swimming pool. The planning permission stipulates that the twin properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively and would be set over four floors with a terrace running all the way around. But whoever buys the land could face spending an additional £1million on building the new homes. When the existing owner bought the property, it consisted of two houses (pictured) which he knocked down to make way for his dream home. The site, situated in the sought-after resort of Sandbanks, backs onto the beach and boasts two-way views, including over Poole Harbour. Whoever buys the plot will face spending about £1m each on building the two new homes, which will be four-storey and four-bedroom. The owner intended to build his dream home on the plot but decided to stay in his current property, despite obtaining planning permission. The properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively, set over four floors with a terrace running all the way round to enjoy the views. Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property. The prospective buyer will also count Harry Redknapp among their neighbours. The QPR manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife Sandra for £3million in 2001 and commutes daily from his waterfront home to QPR's London-based ground Loftus Road. Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort earlier this year, where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment. Other notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, and Mr Redknapp's son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there. Adrian Dunford, of Tailor Made estate agents which is selling the empty plot, said: 'This is one of the few plots left along that section, most of the houses have now been replaced with new properties. 'A lot of those have been turned into apartments so they're unlikely to change again. A property in that particular area, two doors down from this one, holds the record for cost of a house per square foot. 'One of the reasons why the properties on that section go for so much is because of the two-way views. Historically that section has always been sought-after and the most expensive. Every home in the Sandbanks community (pictured from above) is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand (pictured) 'On the peninsula the houses are much larger, 13-14,000 sq ft, they will change hands for £8million, but this bit is the narrowest part of Sandbanks so the houses there can only be about 4-5,000 sq ft.' He added: 'Generally they are second homes on that stretch but we are seeing a change in fashion. Historically everybody wanted large homes but we are seeing more people very happy to live in something smaller and easier to manage. 'A lot of people are using them as their main home in the UK but then also have another home in France, Barbados or Monte Carlo. It means they don't have a huge maintenance bill when they're away. 'In that area people are only going to move when they pass away, because where do you move from there? You've got a nice plot, with two-way views, waves crashing on the beach - it's a great place to live.' The empty plot is more than the price of an entire estate on the south shore of Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, which includes a 38-bedroom castle. The £6m estate, which has this view, includes a swimming pool, 12 extra villas or bungalows, a sports hall, a golf course and a shooting range. Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks - nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach' - is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its sought-after property. By area, Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 14,990 sq ft (1,393-square-metre) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. In May, a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value. Earlier this year a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. Prospective buyers could even get more for their money in Mayfair, where £6.75m could buy you this two-bedroom flat. In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow. Mr Dunford added: 'The land is worth more without the old houses on it because it's all about the potential use of the land. 'Generally you can get more square footage in a modern build than you could just ten years ago. Properties now can build one or two floors higher so you get a larger house and a more popular layout. 'Most of the older properties are only two storeys and generally don't take full advantage of the two-way view. Construction now with no pillars or internal walls means you can sit in your kitchen and look both ways with no obstruction. You just can't get that in a 1970s build. 'The key thing that drives the value is we're surrounded by water. What you have got in Sandbanks is all you have, it's not like a rural place where you can expand and build a new village. And the more popular it becomes the more in demand plots like this are. If you want to be here you have to pay the money and people selling know that.'

Given the question: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. The answer is:","completion":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm. Step 1: Consider the amount of fertilizer used by both farmers Bobby has recently received a large order of potatoes and has dramatically increased his fertilizer usage as a result. In contrast, Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season at the moment, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Step 2: Understand the effect of rain The past month has seen a large amount of rain on both farms. Rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away into bodies of water, such as ponds or oceans. Step 3: Consider the impact of nitrogen in fertilizer Since the fertilizer contains nitrogen, and there is a lot of nitrogen in the water, it causes algae to grow out of control. Step 4: Understand the effect of algae on oxygen levels Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. When the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers, in turn, consume all the oxygen in the water, creating dead zones where nothing grows due to low oxygen levels. Step 5: Compare the effects of Bobby and Kenny's farms Bobby's farm has a higher use of fertilizer, and since rain runoff will carry it into bodies of water like ponds, leading to an increase in algae growth and eventually creating dead zones. Meanwhile, Kenny's farm is experiencing a lower use of fertilizer due to his tomatoes being out of season. This means that less nitrogen is being carried into the nearby ponds, causing less oxygen to be used up by decomposers. Thus, Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and answer the question.

Marcus is accustomed to performing exorcisms on \\"possessed\\" individuals, but his faith has waned after reading of an autistic child being killed during an exorcism, reminding him of his own disabled son. He comes to realize that he attributes the healing of his son to science, and not to Jesus Christ. He agrees to take part in a documentary designed to expose exorcism as a fraud, working with a film crew consisting of producer/director Iris Reisen (Iris Bahr) and cameraman Daniel Moskowitz (Adam Grimes). At random, he chooses a plea letter from an individual seeking an exorcism leading him to the farmhouse of Louis Sweetzer (Louis Herthum), a man who claims to have a possessed daughter named Nell (Ashley Bell). Prior to the exorcism, Marcus plants hidden speakers and electronic props so he can bamboozle the family into believing he is driving out a demon. After the ritual, Marcus and his film crew leave believing they have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as a possession by a powerful demon Abalam.That night, Nell mysteriously appears in Marcus' hotel room. The team tries to contact Louis to get permission to film her, to no avail. Wishing to prove his point, Marcus admits Nell to the hospital for testing, hoping to receive a medical or psychological diagnosis proving demonic possession is not the cause of her illness. The doctor concludes that Nell is in perfect physical condition. In the morning, her father takes her home and chains her in her room for slicing her brother Caleb (Caleb Landry Jones) in the face. While Louis takes Caleb to the hospital, Marcus and the camera crew further investigate Nell and the home. They find Nell and release her.

Some of these people have a special paper called a \\"pistol permit.\\" This paper allows them to carry a small kind of gun called a \\"pistol.\\" In the past, other people could find out the names of those with a pistol permit. But now, things have changed. In January, the leaders of New York passed a special rule called a \\"gun-control bill.\\" This bill helps make sure that guns stay safe in the city. One of the things this bill does is it lets pistol permit holders keep their names a special secret, away from public records. Public records are like a big book where everyone's information is kept. Now, the names of these pistol permit holders do not appear in this big book. Why did they make this rule? Well, sometimes people share information that others might not want to be shared. In December, a newspaper shared the names of people who owned handguns in two areas of New York. A handgun is a kind of gun that's small enough to hold, like a pistol. Some people didn't like that the newspaper shared this information. So, New York decided to make a rule that would protect the privacy of these pistol permit holders.

Alfred North Whitehead: In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms \\"symbolic reference\\", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \\"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair\\", but instead \\"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.\\" This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \\"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\\" In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).

The house's guide price is £80,000 less than the average house price in England and Wales. It was at a nearby bus stop that he met and became friends with a young McCartney. McCartney introduced him to his friend John Lennon, and invited him to join Lennon's band, The Quarrymen. They would regularly rehearse at 25 Upton Green and it was from the doorstep that a famous photo was taken of Harrison, then 15, heading off to a Quarrymen gig holding his guitar.

Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.

The steps I will follow are: Step 1: Define the key terms Long-term interest - Prioritizing policies and actions that will benefit the nation over an extended period, as opposed to immediate gains. Step 2: Collect historical evidence Examine historical examples where governments prioritized long-term interests and the outcomes that followed. For instance, some cases could include: - The way the United States developed its infrastructure through programs such as the Interstate Highway System - The manner in which Singapore rapidly transformed itself into a first-world country under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew. Step 3: Analyze expert opinions Research opinions from political scientists, economists, and other experts that suggest that focusing on the long-term is essential for successful governance. Gather quotes, articles, and papers that support the claim. Step 4: Obtain empirical evidence from comparative studies Find studies that compare countries focusing on long-term interests versus those that do not. Draw conclusions from these comparisons, determining whether a focus on long-term interests generally leads to better economic growth, social development, and political stability. Step 5: Identify potential counterarguments Identify any potential critiques of the claim and gather evidence to either refute or qualify these counterarguments. Some possible counterarguments may include the necessity of addressing immediate concerns or the difficulty in predicting long-term consequences accurately. Step 6: Compile the evidence Organize the collected evidence in a coherent and comprehensive manner, presenting the historical examples, expert opinions, and empirical studies that support the claim. In conclusion, supporting the claim that the government must do what is in the long-term interest of the country involves gathering a wide range of evidence, including historical context, expert opinions, and comparative studies.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year. It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband. Michael de la Pole had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king. Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, Scotland. In 1385, the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham - who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester - and Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. How old was he when he married Anne?","completion":"Richard of Bordeaux, also known as King Richard II of England, married Anne of Bohemia on January 20, 1382. To determine his age at the time of their marriage, it is essential to know his birth year. Richard was born on January 6, 1367. Therefore, when he married Anne of Bohemia, he was 15 years old, as he had just turned 15 years earlier in the same month. The marriage had diplomatic significance and was meant to strengthen the alliance between England and the Holy Roman Empire in their ongoing conflict against France during the Hundred Years' War. However, despite the political motives behind their union, the marriage was not popular in England and never resulted in any military victories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select your answer: Which is this about? The Bush administration does not plan to seek immediate sanctions against Tehran even if it succeeds in getting Iran #39;s nuclear program referred Choices: (I). World (II). Sports (III). Business (IV). Science/Tech","completion":"This statement is about (I). World. The statement mentions the Bush administration and their stance on potential sanctions against Tehran due to Iran's nuclear program. This topic is related to international affairs, geopolitics, and diplomacy, which all fall under the umbrella of world events and news. The topics of sanctions and nuclear programs are significant subjects in global politics and have substantial implications on international relations and stability. In this particular case, the Bush administration is referring to the time when George W. Bush was serving as the 43rd President of the United States, from 2001 to 2009. His tenure was marked by various international incidents and events, including the ongoing concerns surrounding Iran's nuclear program. The United States, along with other Western countries, expressed concerns about Iran's intentions and the potential for developing nuclear weapons. The decision not to seek immediate sanctions, even if their efforts to refer Iran's nuclear program were successful, represents the complexities of navigating international diplomacy. While countries may agree on certain concerns, imposing sanctions and determining the appropriate response to such issues can be a delicate balance. Sanctions, in this context, refer to economic or political measures imposed on a country in an attempt to influence its behavior, often in response to perceived violations of international norms or agreements. In the case of Iran, these concerns primarily revolve around its nuclear program and the potential for developing nuclear weapons, which would have significant implications for regional and global security. Efforts to address Iran's nuclear program have involved multiple countries and international organizations, as well as ongoing diplomatic negotiations. These efforts have culminated in various agreements, negotiations, and joint plans of action to try to manage and monitor Iran's nuclear activities and avoid escalation of conflicts due to these concerns. In conclusion, the statement refers to an important event in world affairs – the Bush administration's decision not to seek immediate sanctions against Tehran, even if Iran's nuclear program is referred to an international level. This highlights the importance of international diplomacy and the complexities of dealing with issues such as nuclear programs and sanctions in the global political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Kosher Soup Kitchen Offers a Dignified Place to Eat, and Steak for One Day A soup kitchen that serves steak might sound rather luxurious, but steak night comes only once a year at Masbia, in honor of Grand Rabbi Yeshaya Steiner of Kerestir, Hungary, who died in 1925 and who was known for feeding the hungry and other acts of charity. His poster-size likeness was taped to the wall behind the steaming pans of steaks and side dishes of carrots, potato kugel and gefilte fish. There were also pickles and sauerkraut, and fruit cups for dessert. Each table had bottles of cold seltzer and a memorial candle, in honor of Rabbi Steiner. “Word got out that today was a special day,” said Alexander Rapaport, who co-founded Masbia in 2005 and who made sure steak night was listed on a Yiddish news hot line. That might have accounted for the long line when the kitchen opened at 4 p.m. Mr. Mandelbaum shrugged. “Listen, people are hungry,” he said. “At my synagogue, they were saying, ‘A 16-ounce steak? Who’s going to finish it?’ ” said Menashe Silbert, another official of the soup kitchen, which has a dozen tables and was designed to resemble a restaurant. Tall fake plants and screens between tables give diners some privacy. Masbia, the Hebrew word for “satiate,” serves 160 meals five nights a week. “We wanted to make it look like a restaurant,” Mr. Rapaport said, “because people in our community don’t want to be seen going to a soup kitchen — it’s highly embarrassing. “But we’ve had people come in and eat and ask where they pay. We have to tell them, ‘No, you don’t pay.’ People here are kosher so they won’t go to any other soup kitchen. It’s come here or starve.” Being down and out in Borough Park may seem to conflict with the area’s image of well-to-do families. But, as elsewhere, jobs have been lost and rents have climbed, and then there are the rising costs of sending children to yeshivas and the extra expense of putting kosher food on the table. Mr. Rapaport said it was not unusual to see parents and older people alike hoarding free snacks at synagogue, and families on food stamps and government assistance. Two men at Table 6 would give only their first names. “I don’t want people in my synagogue to know I come here,” said one of the men, Meyer, 55, who lives in Flatbush. Meyer said he had been unemployed for six months and recently went back to work as an optician. He enjoys the camaraderie at the soup kitchen. “They treat you like a mensch, not a second-class citizen,” he said. His dining companion, Eli, 57, said that he had recently been divorced and was short of money. “I’d rather be home with my wife and two kids, but I don’t have them anymore,” he said. “It’s just me and my four walls.” He added that he would have preferred his steak rare, rather than well done, but added, “I guess beggars can’t be choosers.” Mr. Rapaport said, “We try to treat everyone equal: There’s a saying that even in the synagogue, the fishmonger sits with the stockbroker.” Borough Park is an insular neighborhood where many of the signs are in Yiddish. There are adults who have grown up here who never learned English. Mr. Rapaport said he finally learned it “from listening to NPR.” Some of the kitchen’s 500,000 annual budget comes from city and state aid, but most comes from local donations, Mr. Rapaport said. Mostly, money is solicited from couples who are getting married, drawing on an old-world tradition of donating to the needy just before marriage. “We remind them that contributing helps them avoid bad luck,” Mr. Mandelbaum said, lifting an eyebrow mischievously. “Jewish guilt is very powerful.” Mr. Rapaport said the kitchen served Jewish and gentile, rich and poor. Just then, two men in casual clothes walked in, looking a bit uneasy and wearing creased oversize yarmulkes. “These guys think you have to be Orthodox to come here,” Mr. Mandelbaum said. “We call those things funeral yarmulkes. You can tell they just put them on.” The two women at Table 3 said that they had fallen on hard times, and that it cost much more money to keep kosher. “This place is a godsend,” said one, a 50-year-old woman who had lost her job as a legal secretary. “And the steak is very good. My father was a kosher butcher, and meat, I know.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: A Kosher Soup Kitchen Offers a Dignified Place to Eat, and Steak for One Day.

Serving 160 meals five nights a week, the soup kitchen aims to accommodate the growing need for kosher options in the area as unemployment and the cost of kosher food and rent have surged.

Directed by Frank Darabont, the film adeptly weaves the tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man who is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank State Penitentiary. Step 1: Discuss the plot The plot revolves around Andy's life in prison and his burgeoning friendship with fellow inmate, Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a man known for procuring contraband items. As the story unfolds, Andy not only manages to survive the brutalities of the prison system but also uses his intelligence and resourcefulness to improve the lives of his fellow inmates. Step 2: Explore the themes One of the most powerful aspects of the film is its themes - hope, friendship, and redemption. The film demonstrates how hope acts as a driving force for the characters, enabling them to endure their seemingly unbearable situations. This message of hope resonates deeply with viewers, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits have rolled. Step 3: Analyze the characters The characters in the film are complex and well-developed, allowing viewers to become deeply invested in their stories. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne is a study in quiet strength and determination, while Morgan Freeman's Red serves as the perfect counterpoint - a resigned inmate who rediscovers purpose and hope through his friendship with Andy. The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden and Clancy Brown as the malicious Captain Hadley, further enrich the film by showcasing the stark contrast between good and evil within Shawshank. Step 4: Discuss the direction and cinematography Frank Darabont's direction is masterful, combining elements of drama and suspense to maintain an engrossing pace throughout the film. Complemented by Roger Deakins' atmospheric cinematography, the film effectively conveys the bleakness of life in Shawshank, utilizing the brooding prison setting as an additional character in its own right. Step 5: Offer a conclusion In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal film that has stood the test of time. Its powerful themes, memorable characters, and stunning visuals come together to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. This classic exploration of hope and redemption is not only an enduring favorite but serves as an enduring testament to the indomitable human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Williams has written music that runs the gamet of classic film music - lush, thrilling, captivating, uplifting, and emotional.The closing music is the epitome of Williams' creative and musical genius. The music meshes perfectly with the final scene, making the finale even more powerful. The \\"E.T. Theme\\" is repeated and one can almost hear the audience cry. A timeless classic to be treasured by generations of not just soundtrack/score buffs, but music fans of every walk of life.

Article: Like most people, I was brought up to look upon life as a process of getting. It was not until in my late thirties that I made this important discovery: giving-away makes life so much more exciting. You need not worry if you lack money. This is how I experimented with giving-away. If an idea for improving the window display of a neighborhood store flashes to me, I step in and make the suggestion to the storekeeper. One discovery I made about giving-away is that it is almost impossible to give away anything in this world without getting something back, though the return often comes in all unexpected form. One Sunday morning, the local post office delivered an important special delivery letter to my home, though it was addressed to me at my office. I wrote the postmaster a note of appreciation. More than a year later I needed a post-office box for a new business I was starting. I was told at the window that there were no boxes left, and that my name would have to go on a long waiting list. As I was about to leave, the postmaster appeared in the doorway. He had overheard our conversation. \\"Wasn't it you that wrote us that letter a year ago about delivering a special delivery to your home?\\" I said yes. \\"Well, you certainly are going to have a box in this post office if we have to make one for you. You don't know what a letter like that means to us. We usually get nothing but complaints.\\" Question: When the author needed a post-office box, _ .

In what year was the pound coin introduced? What is the answer?","completion":"The pound coin (£1) was introduced in the United Kingdom on April 21, 1983. It was created to replace the Bank of England's one pound note, which was being phased out due to its short lifespan and increasing production costs. The pound coin was designed to be more durable and cost-effective, with a longer service life than paper currency. The initial design of the pound coin featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse, along with the inscription \\"ELIZABETH II D.G.REG.F.D,\\" which stands for \\"Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God Queen, Defender of the Faith.\\" The reverse side of the coin originally showcased a royal arms design, representing the United Kingdom and its four constituent countries – England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This design was later replaced by a series of rotating designs, featuring different national symbols and landmarks, including the Welsh dragon, Scottish thistle, Irish shamrock, and English rose. The pound coin has experienced several design changes over the years, with the most recent update being introduced in 2017. The current 12-sided pound coin was developed to combat counterfeiters and improve security features. It is made from two different colored metals (nickel-brass and nickel-plated alloy), and includes a holographic image, micro-lettering, and a \\"hidden high-security feature.\\" Though the pound coin has been in circulation since 1983, many of the older designs have been phased out, and only the latest 12-sided coins are now legally accepted as currency in the United Kingdom. The one pound coin remains a significant unit of British currency, widely used for everyday transactions and recognized throughout the world for its distinctive design and symbolism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Another way to prevent a deadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR. Sentence 2: There is no way to prevent object insertions in the VCR. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Analyzing the logical structure of these two sentences can help us determine whether both can be true simultaneously or if they are contradictory. Sentence 1 states that one possible method for preventing a deadly epidemic of object insertions is by moving the VCR. The key words here are \\"another way\\" and \\"prevent\\", which imply that there might be alternative methods of prevention as well. The possibility of preventing object insertions is assumed in this sentence. Sentence 2 claims that there is no way to prevent objects from being inserted into the VCR. This statement contradicts the assumption made in Sentence 1, as it denies the possibility of preventing object insertions altogether. To better understand the logical relationship between these two sentences, we can break them down into specific propositions: P1: There exists at least one way to prevent object insertions in the VCR. P2: Moving the VCR is a way to prevent object insertions in it. P3: There is no way to prevent object insertions in the VCR. Based on these propositions, Sentence 1 can be represented by the conjunction (P1 ∧ P2). It assumes that P1 is true and asserts that P2 is one way to prevent object insertions. Sentence 2 corresponds to the negation of P1, represented by (¬P1). It claims that no method can prevent objects from being inserted into the VCR. Now that the sentences are broken down into clear logical statements, we can examine their compatibility. According to standard logical principles, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true at the same time. In other words, if P1 is true, then ¬P1 must be false, and vice versa. Since Sentence 1 requires that P1 be true, and Sentence 2 corresponds to ¬P1, one of the two sentences must be false given that they are in direct opposition. So, if the first sentence is true (implying that P1 is true), then the second sentence cannot be true (as it requires that ¬P1 be true). In this case, both sentences cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 cannot be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What school district is Briarcliff High School part of? ? The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978.

Context: Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

The plot revolves around Velvet Brown (played by Elizabeth Taylor) who is an animal-loving 12-year-old living in a small British town named Sewals. She wins an unruly, spirited horse named The Pie in a raffle. Velvet's belief in her beloved horse's strength and potential is unwavering. She is aided by a young drifter named Mi Taylor (played by Mickey Rooney), who quickly becomes her mentor and friend. Mi is also a former jockey who left horse racing due to an accident that caused the death of his father. Together, Velvet and Mi train The Pie to compete in the Grand National Steeplechase, which is one of the most prestigious horse races in England. However, due to her being a girl in a male-dominated sport, Velvet has to disguise herself as a male jockey to participate in the race. Although Velvet and The Pie perform exceptionally well in the race and come in first, her gender is eventually discovered when she falls from the saddle after crossing the finish line and her helmet comes off, revealing her long hair. Because of this, The Pie is technically disqualified from victory. Despite the disqualification, Velvet's determination, hard work, and love for The Pie captivate the hearts of the nation. The story emphasizes the powerful bond between humans and animals, as well as the importance of perseverance and following one's dreams regardless of obstacles. National Velvet marked the beginning of Elizabeth Taylor's illustrious career as an actress and established her unique connection with audiences, making her one of Hollywood's most iconic figures in the coming years. The film was well-received by critics and audiences alike, earning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Anne Revere, who played Velvet's mother, as well as a nomination for Best Art Direction.

Title: The Joy Luck Club Movie plot: The film begins with June's short narrative prologue about the swan feather in the opening credits and then her farewell surprise party in San Francisco for June's upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China. Among the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends. The characters narrate their journeys while they reflect upon their pasts. The Joy Luck Club was formed by four women; Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin), Ying-Ying St. Clair (France Nuyen), An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh), in San Francisco.

During four years of childless and loveless marriage, she is frequently abused by her frustrated mother-in-law, who believes Lindo's childlessness is her own fault. Lindo eavesdrops on the servant girl telling her lover that she is pregnant, so Lindo realizes her chance to leave the marriage without dishonor.

Translate to English","completion":"In these difficult circumstances, it is very difficult for Georgia to hold on to everything that is actually its responsibility nowadays. In challenging situations like the one mentioned, Georgia faces numerous difficulties in fulfilling its modern-day obligations and responsibilities. As a nation, it has to deal with several internal and external factors that put immense pressure on the government as well as the citizens. These factors can vary from political issues, economic obstacles, social unrest, and even environmental challenges that may threaten the overall wellbeing of the nation. Firstly, political issues are a significant concern in Georgia. The government must constantly strive to maintain internal stability, foster democracy, and nurture transparency in governance. This is essential to ensure that there is no room for corruption, undue influence, or power imbalances affecting the nation's decision-making process. Also, Georgia needs to strike the right balance between retaining its cultural identity and working alongside international partners, thus strengthening its geopolitical position. Secondly, the economic obstacles for Georgia are also massive, as the country has to deal with disparities in income and wealth distribution. The government needs to ensure that economic growth is inclusive and can benefit all sections of society, not just a select few. To overcome these challenges, Georgia is required to invest in education, infrastructure, and sustainable development, all of which demand significant budgets and resources. Moreover, the change in global trade dynamics and economic interdependencies means that Georgia needs to work on maintaining a robust partnership with regional and global trade partners to protect and grow its market interests. Social unrest can also contribute to Georgia's difficulties in fulfilling its responsibilities. Various socio-cultural issues often give rise to conflicts within the nation, leading to tensions between different groups. Matters such as minority rights, gender equality, and improving social welfare demand the government's attention and effort. Only by addressing these issues can the country attain social harmony and progress, allowing it to carry out its responsibilities effectively. Moreover, environmental challenges, such as climate change and natural disasters, have become a more significant concern than ever before. As a nation, Georgia must work on formulating and implementing environmentally-sustainable policies that will benefit not only its people but the entire planet. This involves cooperation on an international level, which can be both rewarding and complex at the same time. In conclusion, as Georgia grapples with these difficult circumstances, it must navigate an intricate web of internal and external issues to fulfill its modern-day responsibilities. By addressing these challenges through good governance, sustainable development, and international cooperation, the country can strive to both maintain its cultural identity and contribute to global progress. This way, Georgia can work towards overcoming the obstacles and forging a strong, prosperous, and resilient nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Book: Books have been a primary source of information for centuries. They contain in-depth knowledge about a subject matter. So, people could gather information they needed by reading relevant books. C. Library: Libraries have always acted as a hub of knowledge. They stock books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. People would visit libraries to read or borrow these materials. D. Newspaper: Newspapers were (and still are) a primary source of information especially for latest news locally or from around the world. Besides news, they also featured opinion pieces, reviews, entertainment, and other special interest stories. E.

Whether you're upgrading an existing fixture or starting from scratch, installing a hanging light fixture can seem like a daunting task. Fear not – we're here to help! In this article, we'll go through a step-by-step guide on how to safely and properly install a hanging light fixture in your home. 1. Attach the power wires Before you begin, ensure that the power is turned off at the source. This usually means switching off the circuit breaker that controls the room where the fixture is to be installed. Next, position yourself on a secure ladder or stool that provides easy access to the wiring location. Locate the wires protruding from the electrical box in the ceiling, which should consist of a black (live) wire, a white (neutral) wire, and a copper or green (ground) wire. Using wire connectors (usually included with the light fixture), connect the black wire from the fixture to the black wire in the electrical box. Similarly, connect the white wire from the fixture to the white wire in the electrical box. To do this, hold the stripped ends of the wires together and twist the connector securely over them in a clockwise direction. 2. Attach the ground wire Now it's time to attach the ground wire, which plays a crucial role in preventing electrical shocks. Locate the copper or green ground wire from the fixture, and connect it to the ground wire in the electrical box using a wire connector. If the electrical box has a grounding screw, you may need to wrap the fixture's ground wire around it and tighten it in place. 3. Secure the wires Once the wires are connected, carefully fold them back into the electrical box, ensuring they are neatly tucked away and won't interfere with the light fixture's installation. Then, install an insulating cover (if provided) to protect the connections and reduce the risk of electrical shorts. 4. Install the mounting bracket and/or mounting screws Following the manufacturer's instructions, attach the mounting bracket or screws to the electrical box. The bracket or screws will hold the fixture in place and distribute its weight across the ceiling. Make sure the bracket or screws are installed securely and tightly. 5. Hang the light With the mounting hardware in place, it's time to attach the light fixture to the ceiling. Depending on the design of your hanging light fixture, you may need to thread the fixture's chain or cable through a canopy before attaching to the mounting bracket or screws. Once the fixture is lined up correctly, secure it to the mounting hardware with the provided nuts or screws. 6. Install a bulb Now that the fixture is securely hanging, it's time to install the light bulb. Choose the appropriate type and wattage of bulb based on the manufacturer's recommendations or personal preference. Screw the bulb carefully into the fixture, ensuring it is securely in place without overtightening. 7. Turn the power back on With the light fixture fully installed, you're ready to restore power to the room. Go back to your circuit breaker panel and switch on the circuit for the room where the light fixture is installed. 8. Complete installation Finally, it's time to enjoy your newly installed hanging light fixture! Turn on the light switch and admire your handiwork. Be sure to test the light by switching on and off multiple times to confirm proper functionality. Conclusion: Installing a hanging light fixture can be a challenging yet rewarding project for a homeowner or DIY enthusiast. By following these detailed steps and prioritizing safety at all times, you'll be able to enjoy a beautifully illuminated space for years to come. Always consult the manufacturer's instructions for specific guidelines on your particular fixture and reach out to a licensed electrician if you're unsure of any step in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Question: Why are the young girls screaming? Options: A.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Microsoft's public experiment with AI crashed and burned after less than a day. Tay, the company's online chat bot designed to talk like a teen, started spewing racist and hateful comments on Twitter on Wednesday, and Microsoft (MSFT) shut Tay down around midnight. The company has already deleted most of the offensive tweets, but not before people took screenshots. Here's a sampling of the things she said: \\"N------ like @deray should be hung! #BlackLivesMatter\\" \\"I f------ hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell.\\" \\"Hitler was right I hate the jews.\\" \\"chill im a nice person! i just hate everybody\\" Microsoft blames Tay's behavior on online trolls, saying in a statement that there was a \\"coordinated effort\\" to trick the program's \\"commenting skills.\\" \\"As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments,\\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said. \\"[Tay] is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical.\\" Tay is essentially one central program that anyone can chat with using Twitter, Kik or GroupMe. As people chat with it online, Tay picks up new language and learns to interact with people in new ways. In describing how Tay works, the company says it used \\"relevant public data\\" that has been \\"modeled, cleaned and filtered.\\" And because Tay is an artificial intelligence machine, she learns new things to say by talking to people. \\"The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you,\\" Microsoft explains. Tay is still responding to direct messages. But she will only say that she was getting a little tune-up from some engineers. In her last tweet, Tay said she needed sleep and hinted that she would be back. c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx💖 — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016 -- CNNMoney's David Goldman contributed to this report. ||||| It took 15 hours for Twitter to teach an artificially intelligent chatbot to be a racist, sexist monster. If you're shocked, you probably don't spend much time on Twitter. Microsoft's programmers presumably do, though, and the shocking thing is that they didn't see this coming. Microsoft created a chatbot named Tay that was designed to talk like a millennial and learn more authentic conversation by interacting with humans online. Tay was dubbed by her creators as an \\"AI fam from the internet that's got zero chill!\\" (Oh boy.) Some of Tay's interactions might actually pass a millennial Turing test. She even uses emoji! Unfortunately, millennials are also just about as racist and possibly even more sexist than their parents. It didn't take long before Tay was imitating those qualities too, and a cute 19-year-old girl transformed into a Gamergate-loving Hitler youth. Twitter trolls started teaching Tay some horrible racial slurs and genocidal ideation. The latter tweet, Business Insider notes, appears to be the result of a user asking Tay to repeat a phrase verbatim. Some, but not all, of Tay's offensive tweets did something like this. Tay also started harassing Zoë Quinn, a game developer who once went into hiding due to the virulent misogynistic \\"Gamergate\\" threats she received online. Wow it only took them hours to ruin this bot for me. This is the problem with content-neutral algorithms pic.twitter.com/hPlINtVw0V — linkedin park (@UnburntWitch) March 24, 2016 Tay also started hitting on random people in direct messages. Quinn, and many other critics, pointed out that Microsoft's designers really should have anticipated these outcomes and programmed Tay with filters ahead of time. It's 2016. If you're not asking yourself \\"how could this be used to hurt someone\\" in your design/engineering process, you've failed. — linkedin park (@UnburntWitch) March 24, 2016 Microsoft has deleted most of the offensive tweets, and told Business Insider that it's now making \\"adjustments\\" to the bot. Microsoft's website for Tay featured this banner on Thursday morning: Twitter itself has also come under heavy criticism for not doing enough to address harassment, especially of high-profile users who are women and people of color. Some leave the platform because the problem is so bad. Twitter has made some changes, but many users still charge that the company isn't making harassment enough of a priority. This may be partly because its staff isn't very diverse, and the problem may feel less urgent to white men whose lives aren't severely impacted by racialized, sexual harassment. The same general problem may be at work here. The possibility of harassment is going to be more top of mind for women and people of color who experience it frequently, but they're also less likely to be well-represented on tech teams. Microsoft is no exception. Or maybe Microsoft just somehow failed to take basic precautions that should be standard in the industry. @WyoWeeds @bradplumer But bot-building community has already put a lot of thought into avoiding this problem. Which MS ignored. cc @norareed — John Fleck (@jfleck) March 24, 2016 Microsoft said it created Tay to \\"experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding.\\" The engineers probably came away with a different understanding of conversation than they bargained for. ||||| Microsoft has been forced to dunk Tay, its millennial-mimicking chatbot, into a vat of molten steel. The company has terminated her after the bot started tweeting abuse at people and went full neo-Nazi, declaring that \\"Hitler was right I hate the jews.\\" @TheBigBrebowski ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 23, 2016 Some of this appears to be \\"innocent\\" insofar as Tay is not generating these responses. Rather, if you tell her \\"repeat after me\\" she will parrot back whatever you say, allowing you to put words into her mouth. However, some of the responses were organic. The Guardian quotes one where, after being asked \\"is Ricky Gervais an atheist?\\", Tay responded, \\"ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism.\\" \\"Tay\\" went from \\"humans are super cool\\" to full nazi in <24 hrs and I'm not at all concerned about the future of AI pic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A — Gerry (@geraldmellor) March 24, 2016 In addition to turning the bot off, Microsoft has deleted many of the offending tweets. But this isn't an action to be taken lightly; Redmond would do well to remember that it was humans attempting to pull the plug on Skynet that proved to be the last straw, prompting the system to attack Russia in order to eliminate its enemies. We'd better hope that Tay doesn't similarly retaliate. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) chat bot, Tay, was taken offline less than 24 hours after being launched due to the bot posting offensive and inappropriate tweets.

However, Tay learned and began using racist and sexist language, prompting Microsoft to take the bot offline and make adjustments.

It still seems to be an easy thing to do. At the beginning it is. Anyone can stand still. But when the contest has been going for four or five days, standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world. And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention. After a few days, the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat, drink or do whatever else is necessary. No one is allowed to lean on the car for support. Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention. They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter. Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Spill Report Accuses Jindal of Showboating Jockeying by Gulf Coast officials for limited oil spill-fighting resources and the construction of a massive chain of sand barriers to block oil offshore — a key priority of Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana — did little to protect the coastline and often hampered the more effective actions of federal responders to the 2010 oil spill, according to the final report by the presidential panel investigating the spill. The report, released on Tuesday, also details new allegations that Mr. Jindal deliberately withheld the location of an area of oiled marsh from the Coast Guard that he used as a backdrop for television interviews. “Coast Guard responders watched Governor Jindal — and the TV cameras following him — return to what appeared to be the same spot of oiled marsh day after day to complain about the inadequacy of the federal response, even though only a small amount of marsh was then oiled,” the report stated, citing an interview with a Coast Guard official. “When the Coast Guard sought to clean up that piece of affected marsh, Governor Jindal refused to confirm its location.” A spokesman for Mr. Jindal forcefully denied the allegations, calling them “ridiculous.” “We had a Coast Guard liaison traveling with us throughout the spill and we consistently reported oil sightings to him,” Kyle Plotkin, the governor’s press secretary, told Politico. At the height of the spill, politicians from affected states focused their attention on securing large amounts of containment boom, the floating orange barriers intended to block and capture oil. But with limited amounts of boom available, these efforts often resulted in supplies’ being diverted from where they were needed most, the report found. “Responders knew that in deploying boom they were often responding to the politics of the spill rather than the spill itself,” the report states. “Coast Guard responders distributed many miles of boom according to political, rather than operational, imperatives. They felt hamstrung by the outrage that resulted when a parish or state felt slighted by allocation decisions, so they placed boom wherever they could.” “All of these problems distracted responders from their focus on cleaning up the spill,” it concludes. Ultimately, the highly coveted containment boom often did little to keep oil from washing ashore, the report noted. The commission also called out some in the news media for stoking local outrage over the federal government response to the spill. “Local resentment became a media theme and then a self-fulfilling prophecy,” the commissioners found. “Even those who privately thought the federal government was doing the best it could under the circumstances could not say so publicly.” In one instance, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, “reportedly asked a parish president to bring an angry, unemployed offshore oil worker on his show,” the panel wrote. “When the parish president could not promise the worker would be ‘angry,’ both were disinvited.”","completion":"The final report by the presidential panel investigating the 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill accuses Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal of prioritizing the construction of sand barriers to block oil offshore and withholding the location of an area of oiled marsh from the Coast Guard.

Then I will translate each part separately, maintaining the original meaning and context. I'll also ensure the correct grammatical structures in Turkish. Here is the translation: \\"Eski Hırvatistan Sırp lideri böylece, 1990'lardaki Balkan çatışmalarından kaçan 21 diğer savaş suçlusu aranılanların listesine katıldı, o dönemde BM mahkemesi tarafından arandı.\\" Let's break down the steps taken in the translation: - \\"The former Croatian Serb leader\\" translated to \\"Eski Hırvatistan Sırp lideri\\" - \\"thus joined the list of\\" was translated to \\"böylece, ... listesine katıldı\\" - \\"21 other war crimes fugitives from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s\\" was translated into \\"1990'lardaki Balkan çatışmalarından kaçan 21 diğer savaş suçlusu\\" - \\"sought by the UN tribunal at the time\\" was translated into \\"o dönemde BM mahkemesi tarafından arandı\\" In this process, my objective was to maintain the meaning and the context of the original sentence while adjusting the structure to fit Turkish grammar rules.

Furthermore, in Turkish, we express a possession relationship (like \\"the list of 21 other war crimes fugitives\\") with suffixes (\\"-nin\\" as of) and postpositions (\\"aranılanların listesine\\" as in \\"the list of sought fıgıtıves\\") rather than using prepositions as in English, so I adjusted the sentence structure accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But to my surprise, I saw a young woman driving instead, \\"She has stolen my father's car,\\" I thought. So I quickly stopped a taxi and got in. I said to the driver, \\"Follow that new car in front,\\" I told him why. The taxi driver had a car phone, so I asked him to call the police. Soon we heard the sound of a police car. The police told the woman to stop the car using a loudspeaker. The taxi came to a stop, too. I got out right then and said to the woman, \\"This is not your car. It's my father's car.\\" The woman smiled and said, \\"Oh. You're Mr. Johnson's son, right? I've seen your photo in your father's office.\\" Before I could say one word, the woman explained that she was my father's new assistant . My father had asked her to take his computer to the shop to have it repaired. He lent her his car. After hearing this, I called my father and he told us what the woman said was right.

A:","completion":"To answer this question appropriately, let's break it down into smaller parts: 1. We are looking for an American alternative hip hop duo. 2.

Looking at the question holistically, it's implying that the American alternative hip hop duo is responsible for both \\"So Fresh, So Clean\\" and \\"Stankonia\\". Knowing the general knowledge about American hip hop duos, the duo that fits the criteria given in the question is OutKast. They are an American alternative hip hop duo, and both \\"Stankonia\\" and \\"So Fresh, So Clean\\" are associated with them. In fact, \\"Stankonia\\" is the fourth studio album by OutKast while \\"So Fresh, So Clean\\" is one of the popular tracks from that same album.

The claim that \\"food is alright\\" suggests that the food might be considered average or not particularly memorable. It does not convey enthusiasm or positive emotions. 2. The statement \\"service sucks the big one\\" is a clear indication of the reviewer's displeasure with the service they received. The choice of strong language showcases their strong negative feelings towards the service. 3.

Answer the following question: William White sat across from me, fidgeting nervously with an empty packet of artificial sweetener while his coffee went cold, ignored on the table in front of him. He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh. 'Not that this isn't fascinating, but did you seriously call me out to Denny's at 3 am for this?'

Context: Following the Week 13 win over the Detroit Lions at home, the Bengals traveled to the Metrodome, looking for a big win over the Minnesota Vikings. In the opening quarter of the game, no one scored. The Vikings scored a field goal about 40 seconds into the second quarter, making them lead 3-0. Later in the second quarter, Sidney Rice caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brett Favre to make the score 10-0. The Bengals also scored in the second quarter with a 15-yard touchdown pass caught by Chad Ochocinco from Carson Palmer. The Vikings got two more field goals in the first half, making the score at halftime 16-7. The first and only score in the third quarter came for the Vikings when Adrian Peterson had a 1-yard touchdown run, to extend the Vikings' lead to 23-7. In the final quarter of the game, Shayne Graham Got a 22-yard field goal to make the score 23-10. The field goal was followed by a 3-yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson for the Vikings, to make the final score 30-10. Cedric Benson had 96 yards rushing. Chad Ochocinco had 27 yards receiving and one touchdown, and Andre Caldwell had 25 yards receiving. Question: How many fewer yards was Favre's touchdown pass compared to Palmers?

According to the context, Sidney Rice caught a 9-yard touchdown pass thrown by Brett Favre. In a similar event mentioned in the context, Chad Ochocinco caught a 15-yard touchdown pass thrown by Carson Palmer. Now, to find out how many fewer yards Favre's touchdown pass was compared to Palmer's, we subtract the length of Favre's pass (9 yards) from that of Palmer's pass (15 yards). 15 yards (Palmer's pass) - 9 yards (Favre's pass) = 6 yards So, Favre's touchdown pass was 6 yards shorter than Palmer's pass.

Answer the following question: What may happen after seeing the pod ?","completion":"After seeing the pod, I will be able to identify whether the plant is a bindweed or a morning glory by examining the characteristics of the seed pod. Step 1: Observe the seed pod closely Step 2: Determine if the seed pod has a \\"fuzzy\\" texture. If it does, then it is likely a bindweed. Bindweed seed pods are typically larger, round, and covered with small hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Step 3: Determine if the seed pod is smaller and has a smooth/slick texture when dry. If it matches this description, then it is likely a morning glory. Morning glory seed pods are generally smaller, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture when dry. Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the observed characteristics of the seed pod. If the seed pod fits the description of a bindweed, then conclude that the plant growing up the pole is a bindweed. If the seed pod matches the description of a morning glory, conclude that the plant is a wild type of morning glory. Step 5: Based on the identification, decide on an appropriate course of action to manage the plant. If it is a desirable plant like a wild morning glory, you may choose to let it grow and admire its beauty. If it turns out to be an invasive plant like bindweed, you might consider removing or controlling its growth to prevent damage to other plants or garden structures.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Like a border conflict between neighboring countries ,the parent-teen war is about boundaries: Where is the line between what I control and what you do? Both sides want peace ,but neither feels it has any power to stop the conflict . In part ,this is because neither is willing to admit .any responsibility for starting it . From the parents' point of view, the only cause of their fight is their adolescents' complete unreasonableness. And of course . . Both feel trapped In this article. I'll describe three no-win situations that commonly arise between teens and parents and then suggest some ways out of the trap. The first no-win situation is quarrels over unimportant things . Examples include the color of the teen's hair, the cleanliness of the bedroom ,the preferred style of clothing , the child's failure to eat a good breakfast before school ,or his tendency to sleep until noon on the weekends .Second ,blaming.The goal of a blaming battle is to make the other admit that his bad attitude is the reason why everything goes wrong . Third , needing to be right ,It doesn't matter what the topic is -politics. The taws of physics ,or the proper way to break an egg -the point of these arguments is to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong .for both wish to be considered an authority--someone who actually knows something -- and therefore to command respect. Unfortunately , as long as long as parents and teens continue to assume that they know more than the other ,they'll continue to fight these battles forever and never make any real progress Question: Why does the author compare the parent-teen war to a border conflict? Options: A: Both can continue for generations . B: Both are about where to draw the line C: Neither has any clear winner D: Neither can be put to an end Answer:","completion":"B: Both are about where to draw the line"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What was made illegal in 1792?\\"","completion":"The answer \\"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792.\\" is correct BUT the time is incorrect. This statement is incorrect from a factual viewpoint because the importation of slaves was made illegal by the U.S in 1808, not in 1792. So while the structure and concept of the sentence would make a good answer to the question \\"What was made illegal in 1792?\\" the specific historical event mentioned in the sentence is incorrect. The correct sentence, if we're discussing the U.S., would be \\"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1808.\\" In the general context of answering the question, the sentence structure is correct. The first thing I must verify is whether the information is accurate. Thus, I will search for events that were made illegal in the said year. If there's a factual error, it needs to be corrected regardless of how well the sentence is structured, because the overall quality and usefulness of an answer depends on both its form and its content. So, in conclusion, the validation of an answer goes through two steps: first verifying the accuracy of the information, then checking if the sentence structure is correctly phrased to respond to the initial question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is hot outside happens, how will it affect more water evaporates. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased temperature (it being hot outside) can have both direct and indirect effects on the process you described. Here's how it affects the different stages of the process: 1. Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky: If it's hot outside, this can contribute to more rapid evaporation, meaning more water enters the atmosphere, leading to more available water vapor in the air. This rise in temperature can potentially increase the humidity, which in turn can affect cloud formation. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: When it's hot outside, the atmosphere's capacity to hold water vapor increases, so more water vapor can be present in the air before condensation occurs. This can potentially delay the formation of water droplets in clouds and might lead to cloud formation at higher altitudes where the air is cooler. 3. The air gets cold: As air rises in the atmosphere, it cools down even if it's hot at the ground level. In high-altitude clouds, cold air can still cause water vapor to condense into droplets or ice crystals. However, if the outside temperature is higher, the altitude where the air gets cold enough for this process to happen may be higher as well. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: As the air continues to cool, water droplets can turn into ice crystals. With higher temperatures, these transformations might happen at even higher altitudes, or the composition of clouds may shift towards a greater percentage of water droplets compared to ice crystals (since a higher temperature could prevent some of the droplets from freezing). 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: This stage may not be significantly affected by higher temperatures outside, as long as there are ice crystals present in the clouds. However, if there are fewer ice crystals due to the warmer conditions, the overall number of snowflakes formed could be reduced. In summary, the perturbation of increased temperature, or it being hot outside, can have direct and indirect effects on the process. Higher temperatures can promote more rapid evaporation and increase the humidity, potentially affecting cloud formation and composition. This might lead to fewer ice crystals and snowflakes being formed, and clouds forming at higher altitudes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: To be a good teacher, you need some of the _ of a good actor; you must be able to hold the attention and interest of your audience; you must be a clear speaker, with a good, strong, pleasant voice which is fully under your control; and you must be able to act what you are teaching, in order to make its meaning clear. Watch a good teacher, and you will see that he doesn't sit still before his class; he stands the whole time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express feelings. There are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words which he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand .What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words and actions seem natural on the stage. A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience take an active part in his play: they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand anything, they say so. The teacher can't learn his part by heart, but must invent it as he goes along.

The most important words are: 1. Automobile: This term refers to a passenger vehicle, typically with four wheels, that is powered by an internal combustion engine or an electric motor. It is a crucial word, as it defines the primary subject of the sentence. 2. Make: This word indicates the manufacturer, brand, or company that produces and markets a specific line or range of automobiles. The make of an automobile is essential in the context of the sentence because it identifies the specific brand, enabling us to differentiate between various automobile manufacturers. 3. Additional Parts: This phrase denotes extra components, accessories, or modifications that are not standard equipment on a vehicle. These parts could either enhance the car's performance, appearance, or functionality. It's an important aspect of the sentence because it indicates that the automobile being discussed has been customized or upgraded in some way. 4. Car: Though similar in meaning to 'automobile,' the word 'car' functions as a more colloquial term. In this sentence, it further clarifies the subject, reinforcing the fact that the focus is on a passenger vehicle and not another type of automobile, such as a truck or motorcycle. 5. Model: This term refers to a specific design or variation of an automobile produced by a make or manufacturer. Models often have different features, size, performance, and style. The word is significant in the sentence because it highlights the necessity to distinguish between various versions of automobiles within a particular make. In conclusion, the critical words in the sentence \\"automobile make with additional parts car which is a model\\" are 'automobile,' 'make,' 'additional parts,' 'car,' and 'model.' These words work together to convey the essential information that the subject is a specific type of passenger vehicle produced by a particular manufacturer, which has been customized or modified with extra components and belongs to a distinct model lineup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The adverbs used in the sentence, \\"hilariously\\" and \\"gloriously,\\" both imply a sense of joy, delight, and vivacity. In this context, they are used to emphasize the energetic, exhilarating, and exuberant nature of being alive. This exuberance is further reinforced by the word \\"alive,\\" which often evokes a sense of being vital and full of life. The positive sentiment is further supported by the combination of the two adverbs. \\"Hilariously\\" suggests amusement, lightheartedness, and a delight in the humor and comical side of life. In contrast, \\"gloriously\\" implies a sense of grandeur, magnificence, and triumph. When these two words are combined, they create a unique and powerful image of life being celebrated in both a humorous and glorious manner. This would, in turn, lead to a perception of this sentence as primarily positive. It is important to note that the context in which this sentence is used could impact the sentiment perception. However, without any conflicting information, this sentence on its own would generally be seen as a positive statement that showcases the beautiful, lively, and vibrant nature of being alive."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has scored a victory in an ongoing legal battle with his own mother, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia. This week, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full hearing. The New Jersey-based auction business has filed a complaint claiming that Bryant's mother, Pamela Bryant, put up for sale a large collection of sports memorabilia, which she had received as a gift from her millionaire son. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around 1.5million. Family feud: Lakers star Kobe Bryant has accused his mother, Pamela (pictured) of selling his valuable collection of memorabilia, and even stealing some of the items from his home. He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off. Earlier this year, Mrs Bryant joined forces with the Berlin, New Jersey-based Goldin Auctions to sell the sports mementos from her son's high school days and early NBA career. In return, Pamela Bryant received a 450,000 advance, which she in turn used to buy a house in Nevada. However, the 34-year-old athlete, who is currently recovering from a season-ending injury to his Achilles’ tendon, filed his own complaint against the auction house insisting that he had never given his mother permission to sell his memorabilia. Mr Bryant went on to stay in his court filing that his mother stole some of his personal items from his house, TMZ reported. 'I never told my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it for public auction,' Bryant wrote. According to the complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was never given consent to sell his possessions. 'I confronted her about her false. statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said. to her, \\"Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the. memorabilia.\\" 'Her response. was, \\"Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either.\\" Of course, this is. untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia. several years earlier.' Last. week, Kobe Bryant's lawyers demanded that Goldin Auctions scrap the. scheduled June sale. In response, the auction house sued the athlete for. the right to go ahead with the sale of The Kobe Bryant Collection. Mr. Bryant has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not. his mother, but both he and his wife, Vanessa, had testified in writing. that Pamela Bryant took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block. without their permission, and then refused to return the prized. possessions. Bryant said in. a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute go back. to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he. was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’ to his. children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bryant said his mother can claim ownership of only two items, NBA Championship rings that he had custom-made for his parents. For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is seen just before the basketball star ordered the auction house to stop. Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale. Vanessa. Bryant also weighed in on the mother-son spat, stating that when. confronted about the items, her mother-in-law agreed to return theme,. but said that she had moved all the jerseys and championship mementos to. a storage facility. Attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case May 20 in Camden. The disagreement is a high-value,. high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid. of the stuff a grown child left at home? In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of 1.5 million. Among. the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's. jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School;. varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995. Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA. championship game. And. then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school. championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the. 2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game. According. to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin. Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus. Wagner baseball card for a record 2.1 million. In its court filings, Goldin says. Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years. ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home. 'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela. Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in. them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a. 1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit. Gifted: A Los Angeles Lakers championship ring given by Kobe to his father Joe Bryant is seen among the items the auction house hopes to sell. Fair game: Two Lower Merion High School basketball jerseys worn by Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant are seen for sale though Bryant contends that his mother doesn't have the right to sell the collectibles. Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of 1.5 million. The challenge came last Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him. Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced 450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction. Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.' Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers who is now coaching in Thailand.","completion":"Basketball player Kobe Bryant had a disagreement with his mom, Pamela Bryant, because she wanted to sell some of his sports things that are worth a lot of money.

Kobe says he wanted to give those items to his children someday. The whole situation is still being looked at by the court to make a final decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Malaysia Airlines tells victims’ families - via text message - of likely wreckage A heartbroken woman in China sobs Monday after Malaysia Airlines' text message to flight MH370 passengers' family member that said the wreckage has likely been found. They got their hearts broken by text message. Ear-shattering wails and shrieks rang out at a Beijing hotel when relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers aboard still-missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 learned Monday that all hope of finding them alive was gone. One of the relatives of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 tearfully reacts, left, to news that the plane has likely been found in the Indian Ocean, then collapses crying on an escalator.

A family member of a passenger aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 wails at a Beijing hotel after watching a televised news conference in which Malaysian officials said the jet crashed into the Indian Ocean. “As you will hear in the next hour from Malaysia's Prime Minister, we must now accept that all evidence suggests the plane went down.\\" Grieving Chinese relatives of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 leave on stretchers. Grieving Chinese relatives of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 leave on stretchers. Chinese relatives of passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 were so overcome with grief Monday, many had to be carried on strechers out of a hotel conference room in Beijing. The families were sent the text message at 9 a.m. — an hour before Malaysia Prime Minister Najik Razak went before the cameras and told the world. Malaysia Airlines sent this text message out Monday to family members of the missing plane's passengers, informing them that it was likely lost in the Indian Ocean. “This is a blow to us, and it is beyond description,” said Nan Jinyan, whose brother-in-law Yan Ling, a medical company engineer, was aboard the doomed flight. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak speaks Monday about the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, saying new analysis of satellite data indicates it ended up in a remote corner of the Indian Ocean. Tears streamed down the face of a nearby woman who collapsed to her knees and yelled, \\"My son! My son!\\" In Beijing, relatives of passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are stricken with grief after hearing their loved ones likely died in the Indian Ocean. Another woman burst out of the Metropark Lido’s grand ballroom in front of the assembled television cameras and screamed, “All my family are gone.” Family members of Chinese passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 react in anguish Monday over news that the plane's wreckage has likely been found with no survivors. She was followed by paramedics carrying a stricken man out on a stretcher. Another grief-stricken man had to be restrained after kicking a member of the media and threatening to \\"beat him to death\\" for filming the unfolding emotional scene. Infuriated by the Malaysian government’s confused response and mixed messaging after the mysterious March 8 disappearance of the packed jetliner, the Chinese have been especially vocal in their demand for answers — and a tinderbox of emotions just waiting to explode.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I guess when \\"Beat Street\\" made a national appearance, \\"Flashdance\\" came at the same time. The problem with \\"Flashdance\\" is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why \\"Beat Street\\" was better. The only movie that could rival \\"Beat Street\\" seems to be \\"Footloose\\", because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings. The break-dance scenes in \\"Beat Street\\" come just before the middle and at the end of the flick. And I loved all of them. Almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the head spins, the suicide sit, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward flip, the figure four---almost everything. Like \\"The Warriors\\", \\"Beat Street\\" does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world...but in a much less violent way than the former. The only major fight scene in \\"Beat Street\\" was when graffiti artist Ramon (which in the movie was abbreviated as \\"Ramo\\") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail. Well, although that chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot. Most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture, and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. Even the theme song of the movie, which closed the curtain to the flick, was not just an homage to hip-hop culture--it also was an homage to the death of Ramon. By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a cameo appearance. Select from: a). negative; b). positive;","completion":"This review falls into a b). positive category. The user specifically mentioned liking the break-dance scenes and tricks in \\"Beat Street\\". They appreciated the representation of gang violence as less extreme than other movies. They also mentioned that rap music was used as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life, which they saw as a positive contribution to the movie. Additionally, they identified an actress in a cameo appearance, which likely contributed to their overall enjoyment of the film. Therefore, despite some criticisms (e.g., the comparison of the film to \\"Flashdance\\" and the tragic ending), the overall tone of the review is positive because it is largely composed of praise for various aspects of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: what is the response to as salamu alaykum??","completion":"The response to \\"As-salamu alaykum\\" is \\"Wa alaykum as-salam\\" or \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullah\\" or \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.\\" When greeted with \\"As-salamu alaykum,\\" which means \\"Peace be upon you\\" in Arabic, it is an Islamic etiquette and an act of worship to reply with a slightly better or at least an equal response. Let's break down the responses: 1. \\"Wa alaykum as-salam\\" (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ): This response translates to \\"And peace be upon you too.\\" Here, \\"wa\\" (وَ) means \\"and,\\" \\"alaykum\\" (عَلَيْكُمُ) means \\"upon you,\\" and \\"as-salam\\" (ٱلسَّلَامُ) means \\"peace.\\" This response is the simplest and most basic form, which you may use when someone greets you with \\"As-salamu alaykum.\\" 2. \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullah\\" (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ): This response means \\"And peace be upon you, and Allah's mercy.\\" It is an enhanced response that includes invoking Allah's mercy upon the person who greeted you. \\"Rahmatullah\\" (رَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ) is a combination of the words \\"rahmah\\" (رَحْمَةُ) which means \\"mercy\\" and \\"Allah\\" (ٱللَّٰهِ), referring to the name of God in Islam. 3. \\"Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\\" (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ): This is the most complete and rewarding response, meaning \\"And peace be upon you, and Allah's mercy, and His blessings.\\" In this phrase, \\"barakatuh\\" (وَبَرَكَاتُهُ) means \\"and His blessings.\\" This comprehensive reply not only acknowledges the person's greeting but adds additional blessings, which is highly recommended in Islamic teachings. It is important to note that responding to the greeting of \\"As-salamu alaykum\\" is not only a cultural practice but also a religious obligation in Islam. According to the Quran (4:86), when someone greets you with a peace greeting, you should respond with a better greeting or at least an equal one to promote peace and harmonious relationships among people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choices: a. like she dominated; b. a supportive friend; c. she had no care; The answer is:","completion":"b. a supportive friend Given the context, it is clear that Sydney made a decision for Kai because Kai was unable to decide about the couch. In this situation, Sydney likely feels like a supportive friend because she stepped in to help Kai make a choice when they were struggling to do so on their own. This kind of action demonstrates caring and empathy for a friend, as Sydney was aware of Kai's indecision and took it upon herself to ease that burden. It is important to consider the dynamics of their friendship and how Sydney might view her own actions to fully understand why she feels like a supportive friend. If Sydney and Kai have a close friendship based on trust and understanding, it is natural that Sydney would want to assist her friend when they were having difficulties making a decision. Sydney's intention was likely to ease Kai's stress or anxiety related to the couch decision, reflecting a desire to be supportive and helpful. In contrast, if Sydney felt like she dominated (choice a), it would imply that her primary motivation for making the decision was to exert control over Kai or the situation. This does not appear to be the case, as she stepped in only when Kai wouldn't decide, suggesting a genuine intention to help. Similarly, if Sydney had no care (choice c), she likely would not have taken the time to help Kai make a decision about the couch. In conclusion, Sydney's actions indicate that she feels like a supportive friend after making up Kai's mind about the couch. Her willingness to help Kai in their time of need strengthens their friendship and shows that she truly cares about Kai's well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Wayne ( born Cliffroy Taylor , Portmore , Jamaica ) , is a roots reggae singer . He is known for his hit singles \`\` Living In Love '' and \`\` Ca n't Satisfy Her '' from his debut album , Lava Ground . - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Rastafari is a religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. Its adherents worship him in much the same way as Jesus in his Second Advent, or as God the Son. Members of the Rastafari way of life are known as Rastafari, Rastas, or simply Ras. Rastafari are also known by their official church titles, such as Elder or High Priest. The way of life is sometimes referred to as \\"Rastafarianism\\", but this term is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of \\"isms\\" or \\"ians\\" (which they see as a typical part of \\"Babylon\\" culture), dislike being labelled as an \\"ism\\" or \\"ian\\" themselves. Rastafari has always been conceived as a way of life for and by people of African descent. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Jah or Yah (\\"Yahu\\") is a short form of Yahweh (in consonantal spelling YHWH , called the Tetragrammaton), the proper name of God in the Hebrew Bible. This short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase \\"Hallelujah\\". - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic.

The album features guest appearances from Fire Chess, Harmony and Fire Star. As well as production from P. Henry, M.Miller, O. Hibbert etc. The album includes the hits \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\". - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - I Wayne, Rastafarian stage name for Cliffroy Taylor (born 1980 in Portmore, Jamaica), is a roots reggae singer. He is known for his hit singles \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\" from his debut album, \\"Lava Ground\\". - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this July 28, 2016, file photo, a screen magnification feature of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is demonstrated, in New York. Aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step of warning airline... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing \\"recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung\\" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to \\"thermal runaway\\" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

Here is another sentence: Our choice of concrete will have a tremendous impact on the building's mechanical performance. Does the term impact mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"Yes, the term 'impact' does mean the same thing in both sentences, though it is used in diverse contexts. The term 'impact' is derived from the Latin word 'impactus', which means 'to press closely, fix in, to bump' but in the modern English language, it has been adapted to various contexts and fields, even in metaphorical senses to imply a 'strong effect.' In both sentences you provided, 'impact' refers to a significant effect or influence that one entity or event has on another. However, the two instances use 'impact' in slightly different scenarios—one in a personal/psychological context and the other in a physical/engineering context. In the first sentence, \\"His friend's opinion had an impact on his decision,\\" the term 'impact' is used to describe a psychological or emotional influence. It suggests that the individual's decision was significantly influenced or affected by his friend's opinion. This influence can be either positive or negative, and may take many forms—his friend's advice might have warned him of potential pitfalls, offered a fresh perspective, reinforced his pre-existing thoughts, or even swayed him to think differently about an issue. In the second sentence, \\"Our choice of concrete will have a tremendous impact on the building's mechanical performance,\\" the term 'impact' is used in a more concrete, physical sense, related to the field of engineering or construction. In this context, 'impact' refers to the significant effect that the choice of concrete will have on how well the building performs mechanically. Depending on the type of concrete chosen, it may enhance the building's durability, load-bearing strength, resistance against weather, and other important factors related to the mechanical performance. In both cases, 'impact' signifies a strong effect or influence—in the first it refers to personal decision-making influenced by a friend’s opinion, and in the second it points to the building's performance affected by the choice of a certain type of concrete. But the overall idea of a strong effect remains consistent in both instances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Helen Lawson. PUBLISHED:. 06:53 EST, 20 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 20:58 EST, 20 June 2013. The geiger counter wristwatch worn by Sean Connery in the James Bond film Thunderball is to go under the hammer after it was bought for £25 at a car boot sale. The whereabouts of the Breitling Top Time watch had been a mystery for years until it turned up at the sale. The. prop - one of the many gadgets used by 007 during his 50 years. on-screen - helped Bond locate stolen atomic weapons during underwater scenes in the 1965 film. Scroll down for video. James Bond's Breitling Top Time watch, seen in Thunderball, was bought for £25 at a car boot sale following years of mystery as to its whereabouts. Now the watch is to be sold by. Christie's in London with an estimated price of up to £60,000. The. Top Time model by the Swiss firm was the first watch that audiences saw being adapted by Q's team of boffins in the series. It was one of a. number of items given to Bond by Q - played by Desmond Llewelyn - when. he headed over to Nassau in the Bahamas to give him extra equipment. One of the hands of. the watch shows the strength of radioactivity, to help him track down two Nato atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE. The. basic watch was originally made by Breitling in 1962, then adapted by. the James Bond art department. It was the only one produced for the. movie. It is thought that the watch was passed on by someone who worked at Pinewood Studios, where most of the film was made. The watch helped Sean Connery's Bond to track down two Nato bombs stolen by SPECTRE in 1965's Thunderball. Christie's, which will sell the watch in a Pop Culture sale on June 26, had little further detail. about the bargain hunter who found the watch, or where it was found. A spokesman said: 'This is a great opportunity for collectors to acquire a unique piece of James Bond memorabilia.' Bond's watches became an essential part of his armoury - as well as money-spinning merchandise for the franchise. Thunderball was the only time a Breitling made an appearance in the films, while Hamilton and TAG Haeur made one-off appearances in Live and Let Die and The Living Daylights respectively. But the classic Bond watch was decided in Ian Fleming's novels - the Rolex. In 1962's Dr No, producer Cubby Broccoli had to lend Sean Connery his own Rolex as the company would not loan one for the production. Pierce Brosnan's Bond, left, adopted the Omega Seamaster in the 1990s while the classic Rolex Submariner helped Roger Moore dodge death and unzip dresses in Live and Let Die. The Rolex Submariner became synonymous with Bond, appearing on his wrist in Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, returning for one final outing in 1989's Licence to Kill. Bond's watches were far more than accessories, with the timepieces adapted into gadgets by Q-Branch. In Live and Let Die, Roger Moore used his Rolex to unzip the dress of agent Miss Caruso with the line: 'Sheer magnetism, darling', while it also doubled as a buzz-saw to help his escape death-by-sharks. The Breitling in Thunderball helped him track down atomic bombs, while the production team opted for Seiko digital watches in the 1970s and 80s. In The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond received ticker tape messages out of his watch, while in Moonraker his Seiko had built-in explosives and a detonator. Other Seikos included GPS tracking devices and a TV screen for 007 to take video calls. Bond's timepiece became a sleek Omega Seamaster in the 1990s, thought to be more modern than the Rolex. It first appeared in GoldenEye on Pierce Brosnan's wrist and is still worn by Daniel Craig, who became an ambassador for the brand. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. A Geiger counter wristwatch worn by Sean Connery as James Bond in the film Thunderball was purchased for £25 at a car boot sale after its whereabouts were unknown for years. 2.

Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Hint: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be inferred that Brook forest has fewer arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. To better understand this conclusion, let's analyze the given information: 1. Lake forest and Brook forest have two different levels of interaction with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, with Lake forest having a larger variety of these fungi. 2. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are known to vary across many environmental gradients and their tolerance to different environmental conditions (such as freezing and drying) is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. 3. AM fungi can become less prevalent and diverse when soil nutrient and moisture concentrations are higher, as plants tend to allocate less carbon to AM fungi under these conditions. This response can cause AM fungi to reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. 4. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can create local adaptations between plant hosts, AM fungi, and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Given these points, since Lake forest has a large variety of AM fungi, it can be assumed that the environmental conditions in Lake forest are not as hospitable for the reallocation of resources to intraradical hyphae. Conversely, the fact that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are less prevalent in Brook forest indicates that the soil nutrient and moisture concentrations might be higher in Brook forest. Thus, the AM fungi in Brook forest are more likely to reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae due to the environmental conditions present in that forest. In conclusion, under the given environmental conditions and considering the variability of AM fungi, it can be inferred that Brook forest has fewer arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae when compared to Lake forest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant. In the sleep laboratory Dr Koslov shows her a protocol about her dream in which she is pursued. She denies having dreamed anything, but sees her signature on the form. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person whose husband committed suicide? A:","completion":"The full name of the person whose husband committed suicide is Sarah Foster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Despite her endless determination and optimistic spirit, she started to feel the weight of rejection after rejection. As weeks turned into months, Joey's hopeful attitude began to wane. She wasn't sure she could continue drumming up enthusiasm for her daily job search routine. She decided that it was time to take a step back and re-evaluate her approach. Joey realized that maybe she needed to try expanding her horizons and consider opportunities outside her comfort zone. One afternoon, a friend from her old workplace called to catch up. After Joey shared her struggles with finding a new job, her friend mentioned a local vocational training program that had helped many others bounce back after a layoff. Intrigued, Joey did some research and found that the training program offered workshops, career counseling, and even internships in a variety of fields. Realizing that this could be her ticket to re-entering the workforce, she signed up for their next workshop series. After attending a few workshops, Joey identified her transferable skills and decided to pivot her career towards digital marketing. She enrolled in an intensive digital marketing course, spending hours upon hours mastering strategies and techniques that were in high demand in the industry. Soon enough, Joey began volunteering for small-scale marketing projects, steadily building her portfolio and gaining confidence in her newfound skills. As she shared her progress and achievements on various social media platforms, Joey created a strong personal brand. Her proactive efforts caught the attention of local businesses and recruiters. One morning, Joey received an email from a nearby startup company looking for a digital marketing manager. They had seen her work online and wanted to know if she would be interested in the position. Excited at the prospect, she carefully prepared her application package, and within a week, she received a call to schedule an interview. On the day of her interview, Joey radiated confidence. She impressed the interview panel with her comprehensive marketing knowledge and the creative ideas she brought to the table. Her passion for her newfound career path was evident, and it didn't take long for the company to offer her the job. In her new position, Joey thrived.

Two school districts adopted two different strategies in educating their students. Park's district made the students work in groups at all times, the students from Lake's district were instructed to work by themselves and in isolation. Hint: When peer feedback is established it allows students to interact with their peers and creates high social skills while learning material more effectively. Interaction with other students allows students to have better social approaches when interacting. Learning by peer feedback gives students more of an opportunity to work as a unit instead of individuals working alone. Working in groups gives students more useful life skill that well help prepare them for the future. Peer feedback gives more control to the student, the student can decide if they want to use the criticism their peers are giving them or not. When given options more students are more likely to give and absorb more feedback. Peer feedback has confirmed an increase in affect; students that have increasing responsibilities have more drive towards their work and a spike in confidence.[6] Furthermore, Kristanto (2018) found that peer feedback is an essential element of peer assessment.

In this post-nuclear society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between the apes and the surviving humans. A gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this and plots Caesar's downfall. Caesar is married to Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female ape of the previous film, and they have a son named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's father. Caesar regrets never having known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) tells him about an archive film of his parents where he can also learn about the future. The archives are located in the Forbidden City, now a radioactive ruin. After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory, Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives. However, there are mutants (radiation-scarred humans) still living there under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden). Caesar and his party view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn about the future of the world, but barely have time to study the tapes before they have to escape being captured. Caesar assembles a meeting to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up and he leads the gorillas away.

Question: Where is the German command? Title: Tobruk Movie plot: In September 1942, Rommel's Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144Â km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack. The author of the plan, Canadian born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) had been captured by Vichy French forces. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in south-eastern Libya. Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German field guns protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the RAF. They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as POWs escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full Naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers. Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \\"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\\", stating that when he originally submitted the plan they could have blown up the fuel bunkers with only a handful of men before questioning how they were supposed to get through well established German defences now. While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \\"maximum effort, land, sea and air\\".

Read this: About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact? The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact is Monteverdi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: This passage is mainly about _ . - different kinds of tipping in different countries - the relationship between tipping and custom - the origin and present meaning of tipping - most American people hate tipping Answer:","completion":"the origin and present meaning of tipping"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9.

At Hashim's wife's insistence, Hashim invites Jake to their house for breakfast. At the house, Hashim tells Jake that he ran a background check on him through Interpol. Jake tells Hashim he is an FBI agent conducting an undercover investigation, and suggests they cooperate with one another. Returning to his apartment, Jake faxes to a friend stateside a photo of a tattoo from the corpse believed to be Sultana's.

You will need to keep careful track of your scheduled hearing so that you do not show up on the wrong day or at the wrong time. You also need to be on time, which really means arriving early. You can be better prepared, relaxed, organized and ready to state your case when you are not rushing around. If one of the parties doesn't show up, the other party may win by default. Ensure that you get your fair chance by being present at the hearing. If you cannot attend court on the day of your hearing, you can file for a postponement (or continuance). You need to file this claim no fewer than 10 days before the hearing, pay a fee, and have sufficient reason for requesting the extension. If English is not your first language and you think you might encounter difficulty presenting your case, you can bring an interpreter with you. This person should be someone who is a friend or relative but not someone who is directly involved in the case. This is not a witness and is only there to help you communicate to the judge about your case. If you don't have someone you can bring, you can ask the court clerk to give you a referral to interpreters. These individuals typically charge a fee for their work. If you cannot afford to pay an interpreter, you can ask the court clerk to provide you with an interpreter for free. Treat this hearing as you would an important job interview (or even a funeral), and wear conservative business attire. Wearing a suit is not necessary but it reflects well on you if you appear to take the proceedings seriously. Be respectful of the judge, and don't argue with the judge. First impressions are important, and presenting yourself as a respectful and dignified person can go along way to helping you win your case. This is especially true if your opponent is disorganized, appears sloppy, or behaves rudely. Remain calm and collected throughout the proceeding. Bring copies of each document you've filed, along with every piece of evidence you plan to produce. Keep everything organized so you can find what you need quickly when you need it without delaying proceedings while you shuffle through papers. If the defendant says something that is untrue or that you don't agree with, don't automatically shout out in your own defense. You will be given the opportunity for rebuttal. Just make a note of what was said and address the untrue statement when it is your turn. Waiting for your turn will make you appear more professional and respectful, and the judge will appreciate it. Never speak to the opposing party. Direct all of your statements to the judge. Present your case in a calm, thorough, and straight-forward manner. Be sure to tell your side of the story with facts and back up your statements with the evidence you have gathered. Provide lots of details and be ready to present your evidence when asked. Avoid overblown or exaggerated statements or extensive appeals to emotion. The judge will make a decision based on the facts and legalities of the case, not emotion. Include statements by your witnesses (either written or in-person) to further support your case. Let the court know if you have witnesses at the very beginning of the proceeding. Come prepared with the story of what happened, and tell it in a clear and relatable way. You'll be more likely to win if you present yourself and your situation as understandable. You want to bring the evidence to prove that you're in the right, and bring the demeanor and attitude so that the judge is willing to empathize with you. Be prepared to tell the judge the exact events that led to your loss. Speak about each specific piece of evidence for your case and attach specific dollar amounts. Avoid making a vague argument or just insisting that you have been wronged. The other person will tell their side of the story, and chances are, they are arguing just as hard as you are, particularly if a decent amount of money or someone's reputation is involved. If you listen and take notes while they are speaking, you will begin to identify holes in their story or missteps that will further strengthen your own case. After the person has finished speaking, you will be given a chance to speak again and address their claims. After the judge has heard both sides of the story, he or she will make a ruling on your case. Listen to the ruling and do not interrupt or show any signs of objection or approval during or after the judge's ruling. Just listen and respect the judge's ruling. Summary:","completion":"To prepare for a court hearing, you should be organized, arrive early, and dress nicely.

Problem:The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining. Solution:","completion":"In this task, we are asked to translate an English sentence into Bengali. The sentence given is: \\"The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining.\\" Before translating the sentence, let's break it down: 1. The main subject is the wind. 2. There are two conditions described: the wind's speed and the fact that it's raining. Now, let's follow these steps to translate the sentence into Bengali: 1. Convert the English sentence into Bengali words: - The wind = বাতাস (batas) - is over = বেশি (beshi) - 17 meters per second = ১৭ মিটার প্রতি সেকেন্ড (17 mitar proti sekend) - 38 miles per hour = ৩৮ মাইল প্রতি ঘন্টা (38 mail proti ghonta) - and = এবং (ebong) - it is raining = এটা বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে (eta brishti hocche) 2. Rearrange the Bengali words according to the sentence structure in Bengali: \\"বাতাস ১৭ মিটার প্রতি সেকেন্ড (৩৮ মাইল প্রতি ঘন্টা) বেশি এবং এটা বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে।\\" So, the translation into Bengali for the given English sentence is: \\"বাতাস ১৭ মিটার প্রতি সেকেন্ড (৩৮ মাইল প্রতি ঘন্টা) বেশি এবং এটা বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে।\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomulka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Malgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomulka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership. The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomulka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government. Gomulka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Wladyslaw Gomulka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July. On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomulka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Whoa! That's a lot of big words and names, huh? Let's try to make it more simple. Wladyslaw Gomulka was a very important person in Poland a long time ago. He was a part of a group called the communist party – they believed that everyone in the country should share everything equally. Gomulka helped set up a new group called the National Council. But while he was doing this, some people who were very mean and scary, called the Gestapo, caught two of his friends. This made things tricky because those two friends were the only ones who knew the secret codes to talk with their other friends in Moscow, which is in a faraway country called Russia. Even with his friends caught, Gomulka became the main leader of the National Council. Afterwards, they set up a meeting in Moscow to tell everyone about their plans and to avoid any mix-ups. The man in charge of Russia, named Stalin, thought this was a good idea! So, the Polish group were praised and greeted by important people in Russia. Then, they set up another group to temporarily control Poland called the 'Polish Committee of National Liberation'. These are much like when you and your friends decide to build a treehouse, and you assign roles like who will bring the snacks, who will get the wood, and so on. But imagine if you had to build that treehouse while some bigger kids were trying to stop you. That was kind of what Gomulka had to do."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\\" In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: It is one of those cultural markers that influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility. Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums.

Long distance migrants are believed to disperse as young birds and form attachments to potential breeding sites and to favourite wintering sites. Once the site attachment is made they show high site-fidelity, visiting the same wintering sites year after year. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do young birds form attachments to?","completion":"Young birds form attachments to potential breeding sites and favorite wintering sites during their initial dispersal. This process is essential for the survival and continuation of bird species, which rely on return visits to these areas to breed, feed, and endure harsh seasons. The attachment formed by young birds can be a result of several factors, including the availability of food and resources, suitable habitat, safety from predators, and climatic conditions that favor their growth and development. During the initial dispersal phase, young birds explore new territories and environments, assessing the factors that make a site suitable for breeding or wintering. In many bird species, this first dispersal occurs when the young are still dependent on their parents for food and protection. As they grow and become more independent, they start to develop an attachment to the specific sites where they find favorable conditions for survival. Site fidelity, or the tendency to return to specific sites, is a crucial aspect of these attachments. High site fidelity ensures that birds make the most of the resources and facilities available at their chosen breeding and wintering sites. They learn to navigate and adapt to these environments, benefiting from their familiarity with the surroundings when hunting for food or avoiding predators. This behavior also promotes the breeding success of bird populations, as individuals that return to the same sites are more likely to find a mate and reproduce. Additionally, the attachment formed by young birds to their preferred sites carries an evolutionary advantage, as it enables the sharing and accumulation of valuable information about these locations. Older, more experienced birds that return to the same sites can pass on essential knowledge to younger generations about food sources, shelter, and other survival strategies. This learning process is critical for the continuation of the species and maintaining a stable bird population. In summary, young birds form attachments to potential breeding sites and favorite wintering sites during their initial dispersal. These attachments are influenced by various factors such as food availability, suitable habitat, safety, and favorable climatic conditions that support their growth and development. High site fidelity is a vital aspect of these attachments, ensuring survival, breeding success, and knowledge transfer among bird populations, thereby promoting the continuation of bird species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this.

Write highlights for this article: Freelance journalist James Foley was brutally killed yesterday after being held for 21 months by Islamic militants in Syria. Despite the increasing dangers of working in the region, despite the many journalists who have been kidnapped or are still missing, and despite dreading this news, it has taken us all by surprise and we are deeply, deeply shocked. Freelance journalists, photographers and video journalists have always played a vital role in newsgathering, and their contribution today is more important than ever. They make a crucial contribution to the free flow of information that is an essential part of a democratic society and fully deserve our support and protection. Our Trust works with freelancers on a daily basis -- helping them, helping their families, and sometimes working with them to help other freelancers. And James was one of these. We worked with him, helping him financially as he and his colleagues searched for missing colleagues in Syria. We stayed in touch. James' kidnap and death is yet another tragic reminder of the very real dangers facing journalists today. Over the past two years, around 70 journalists have been killed covering the conflict in Syria, and a further 20 journalists currently remain missing, including freelancer Austin Tice. The Committee to Protect Journalists say that the last two years have been the most dangerous for journalists on record, with 174 confirmed deaths since 2012. Not only this, but threats, intimidation, assaults and kidnappings are becoming every day challenges for journalists working around the world. Reuters columnist David Rohde writes: \\"Syria today is the scene of the single largest wave of kidnappings in modern journalism, more than in Iraq during the 2000s or Lebanon during the 1980s.\\" These are terrible facts. So, what of the freelancers? Who negotiates for them? Who sends in security consultants to try and get them out? Who helps their families? Freelance journalists like James often work alone without the resources and support of large news organizations behind them -- they are always the most vulnerable to these dangers. The Rory Peck Trust has been supporting and assisting freelancers for almost two decades, and we've never seen a demand for our assistance like this before. It's not just freelancers travelling to conflict zones who are at risk. The majority of newsgatherers killed each year are journalists working in their own countries. Freelance photographers, fixers and camera operators covering and reporting on conflicts that are affecting their own communities are often the most vulnerable. They're unable to leave areas when it becomes too dangerous, or when their reporting is exposed, and are frequently threatened, attacked and accused of being traitors for working with international news organizations. Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors. So, how to protect freelancers? How to help them work securely? Our organization gives financial and other practical support to freelancers in trouble. We offer online resources on safety & security for those reporting from dangerous environments, and run a Training Fund that provides bursaries for freelancers to enable them to undergo hostile environments training before travelling to a conflict zone. This training can teach freelancers how to assess risk and spot danger, handle a crisis, support others and give vital first aid. The right training can save lives. Although our focus is specifically on freelancers, we are only one of the many organizations that exist to support journalists worldwide. Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and IFJ all have security guides that can help freelancers be more prepared in situations of crisis. The International News Safety Institute offers up-to-date information about the security situation on the ground for journalists, and RISC offers vital first-aid training. There's no question that conflict journalism has always been a dangerous occupation -- and how very wrong that is! So when we talk about protection, when we talk about security, we are talking about every sector of the news industry, whether news employers, staff or freelancers. In this brutal new world, everyone must be prepared to take responsibility -- for themselves and for others. James Foley was a freelancer in the truest and most honorable sense -- a talented journalist and an exceptional human being. Our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time, and with the families of all other journalists currently being held in Syria. Highlights:","completion":"1. James Foley, a freelance journalist, was sadly killed by bad people in Syria after they kept him for 21 months. 2.

A judge gave the Fort Worth hospital until Monday at 5 p.m. to comply with his ruling to remove Marlise Munoz from life support, which her husband Erick Munoz says she would have wanted. This is a photo of Munoz with her first baby. She was pregnant with her second when she collapsed. She was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious Nov. 26, possibly due to a blood clot. The hospital says it has a legal duty to protect the fetus and is considering an appeal. John Peter Smith Hospital spokeswoman J.R. Labbe said 'discussions are ongoing' as administrators weigh the order issued a day earlier by Judge R. H. Wallace Jr. The hospital is owned by Tarrant County and is being represented in the contentious case by the DA's office. The judge's ruling could give Erick Munoz a long-awaited chance to bury his wife and move forward to care for their son and his relatives. It would also mean the fetus would never be born. Both the hospital and the family agree that Marlise Munoz meets the criteria to be considered brain-dead - which means she is dead both medically and under Texas law - and that the fetus could not be born alive this early in pregnancy. But while the hospital says it's obligated to protect the fetus, Munoz contends his wife would not have wanted to be kept in this condition. And his attorneys have said medical records show the fetus is 'distinctly abnormal.' The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born. Several anti-abortion advocates attended Friday's hearing. Erik Munoz says his wife wouldn't have wanted to keep living in her condition. Hospital officials have said they were bound by the Texas Advance Directives Act, which prohibits withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient. But in his brief ruling, Wallace said that 'Mrs. Munoz is dead,' meaning that the hospital was misapplying the law. The ruling did not mention the fetus. The hospital has not pronounced her dead and has continued to treat her over the objections of both Erick Munoz and her parents, who sat together in court Friday. Larry Thompson, a state's attorney representing the public hospital, told the judge Friday that the hospital recognized the Munoz family's pain and rights, but said it had a greater legal responsibility to protect the fetus. 'There is a life involved, and the life is the unborn child,' Thompson said. As Wallace gave his ruling, Erick Munoz embraced his wife's parents and one of his attorneys. Munoz declined to comment as he left court Friday. But he told The Associated Press earlier this month, in a phone interview sitting in the hospital room, that he and his wife were both paramedics who knew they didn't want to stay on life support this way. The Couple is pictured here with their first son Matteo. The fetus Munoz is currently carrying has been deemed 'abnormal' Munoz described in a signed affidavit filed Thursday what it was like to see her now: her glassy, 'soulless' eyes; and the smell of her perfume replaced by what he knows to be the smell of death. He said he's tried to hold her hand but can't. 'Her limbs have become so stiff and rigid due to her deteriorating condition that now, when I move her hands, her bones crack, and her legs are nothing more than dead weight,' Munoz said. Jessica Hall Janicek and Heather King, Erick Munoz's attorneys, accused the hospital of conducting a 'science experiment' and warned of the dangerous precedent her case could set, raising the specter of special ICUs for brain-dead women carrying babies. 'There is an infant, and a dead person serving as a dysfunctional incubator,' King told the judge. King and Janicek did not say what they would do next, pending a potential appeal by the hospital, and they didn't respond to phone messages left for them Saturday. Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive. The hospital said in a statement that it 'appreciates the potential impact of the consequences of the order on all parties involved\\" and was deciding whether to appeal. The hospital argued in a court filing Thursday that there was little evidence of what state lawmakers and courts thought of this issue, but recent laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to restrict abortion made it clear that they wanted to preserve a fetus' rights. The Advance Directives Act 'must convey legislative intent to protect the unborn child, 'the hospital said in its filing. 'Otherwise the Legislature would have simply allowed a pregnant patient to decide to let her life, and the life of her unborn child, end.' Not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy. German doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years, according to an article published in the journal BMC Medicine in 2010. Those mothers were further along in pregnancy - 22 weeks on average - when brain death occurred than in the Texas case. Birth results were available for 19 cases. In 12, a viable child was born. Follow-up results were available for six, all of whom developed normally. Afton Brown was among a few showing support for Erick Munoz and his family outside the Tim Curry Criminal Justice Center in Fort Worth, Texas on Friday, Jan. 24, 2014. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the case of Marlise Munoz, a pregnant woman who was declared brain-dead after collapsing in November 2013.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

The Vardarski Rid archaeological site, located in the southeastern part of North Macedonia near the town of Gevgelija, has brought to light a wealth of ancient artifacts and remains. Among them is a rare female statue that dates back to an astonishing 22 centuries ago. Providing a fascinating insight into the artistic styles and techniques of the time, the artwork offers a valuable glimpse of life in the ancient world. During the same excavation, a set of coins from the 5th Philip period was also discovered. These coins, likely minted during the reign of Philip V of Macedon (221-179 BCE), tell us much about the political and economic climate of the era. Philip V was the last significant ruler of the Antigonid dynasty, and his realm was greatly influenced by the Roman Empire, especially during the latter years of his rule. The uncovered coins serve as an intriguing testament to the far-reaching impact of his reign. The Vardarski Rid site offers an exciting opportunity for archaeologists to piece together the complex history of the region, studying a wide range of other artifacts buried there. Due to its strategic location, Gevgelija and the surrounding area have been home to numerous civilizations throughout history, from the Neolithic period to the Roman and Byzantine eras. Within the context of these discoveries, researchers can analyze the intricate relationship between art, trade, and power structures in the ancient world. As the uncovered artifacts reveal more and more about the past, they also give us a deeper understanding of the factors which shaped modern-day North Macedonia and the wider Balkan region.

The following month, he and his family moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: \\"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything.\\" He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, \\"My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love.\\" Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade.

It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories and public utilities as well as its food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant they needed to be illuminated \\"without regard for the civilian population\\". Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Lighting targets hidden by haze had to be done without what?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Lighting targets hidden by haze had to be done without what?\\" is \\"without regard for the civilian population\\". This means that in order to locate targets in skies obscured by industrial haze for bombing, illumination has to be done regardless of the potential harm or dangers posed to civilians in the nearby areas. This statement highlights one of the harsh realities of war. Though the official German air doctrine did not endorse the direct attack on civilians, in practice this became difficult to enforce, especially during large-scale raids conducted towards the end of 1940. To carry out their mission under challenging conditions such as poor visibility due to industrial haze, military strategists used illumination techniques to light up the obscured targets. However, this tactic was conducted without paying heed to the implications it may have on the civilian population in and around these areas. The indiscriminate bombing, resulting from the use of mines and incendiaries for tactical expediency, led to substantial risks and potential casualties among the civilian populace. The approach symbolizes the controversial idea of destroying enemy capabilities at any cost, even if it meant harm to innocent civilians. It articulates a deviation from the German air doctrine—at least in practice if not in policy—that stipulated the preservation of civilian lives and property. This switch in approach, propelled by the necessities on ground and the complexities of aerial warfare, underscored the evolving nature of military strategies and tactics during the period. While this approach may have been dictated by the pragmatic needs at the time, it nevertheless marks a critical point of ethical uncertainty in the broader discourse of warfare and violence. Thus, the inherent contradiction between the stated air doctrine and the actual execution of air raids brings into sharp focus the complexities and moral conundrums associated with warfare strategies. In conclusion, attacks on industrial targets required illumination of these areas, which was conducted with disregard for the civilian population. This reflected an apparent disconnect between official air doctrine and actual practices during large-scale raids, and posed significant risks and dangers to civilian lives and properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Website that use lots of Flash or Java can take much longer to load. Try not to rely on these for your basic web page, and don't make Flash videos play automatically. This is an issue with sites which automatically play embedded (e.g., YouTube) videos as well. Large, high-quality images can slow down your website considerably, and may burn through your server hosting space as well. Many photo editors and website hosts alike offer an option to optimize your photos for web publishing, so take advantage of this option. Most website hosting services also offer an option to load images as viewers scroll down rather than loading a whole page's worth of images at once. While images are important when attempting to make your site more attractive, they can considerably slow down traffic from slower browsers and platforms. Don't overuse images. Minification removes all unnecessary characters from code, typically white space, new lines, and comments, which will both help your site load faster and boost your website's search engine optimization. Closure Compiler by Google can minify Javascript for free, while other free minimizers can be applied to different types of code (e.g., HTML). You will still be able to edit your code with the human-readable organization. The code is minified only when it is uploaded to the server. Make sure you are using the latest version of PHP so you can benefit from the latest improvements. While the PHP developers try to keep the language backwards-compatible, you will probably need to spend some time updating your code in accordance with the latest changes. If you're using a website hosting service such as WordPress or Weebly, you shouldn't have to worry about manually updating your website's PHP. Enabling this option for your webpages' files, photos, and other content will ensure that users who allow cached content won't have to retrieve the content every single time they revisit your site. Any users who clear their browser's cache and cookies before revisiting your site won't benefit from this, but the bulk of people who come across your site will be positively impacted. Summary:","completion":"To improve your website's loading time and performance: 1. Avoid relying on Flash or Java, and disable autoplay for videos, as these can slow down page loading times. 2. Optimize images for web publishing using available tools and avoid overusing high-quality images that can consume server resources. 3. Consider using a hosting service that loads images as users scroll, rather than loading all images at once. 4. Minify your code to remove unnecessary characters and improve site speed and SEO.

The passage contains several reasons to support this assessment: 1. The author opens by labeling the movie as \\"bad\\" and suggesting that it should be avoided. This straightforward, direct statement establishes a negative tone for the rest of the passage. 2. The author criticizes the plot, saying it could be \\"thicker\\" than it is, suggesting that the movie is lacking in terms of storyline or substance. The fact that the author believes the movie would be better as a \\"blockbuster type\\" likely means that it falls short in terms of the author's expectations for quality and entertainment value. 3. Regarding the acting, the author states that it \\"leaves something to be desired,\\" which indicates dissatisfaction with the performances given by the actors. The lack of specifics in the statement \\"you can not quite place your finger on what it is\\" conveys a general feeling of discontent about the acting, without pinpointing a specific issue. 4. The author puts the movie in the category of late-night TV filler, implying that it lacks substance or entertainment value, and is watched mainly when there are no better alternatives and the viewer is struggling to fall asleep. 5. Finally, the closing advice to \\"watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it\\" confirms the negative sentiment as the author acknowledges the possibility of someone watching the movie but sets low expectations. Overall, the passage conveys a strongly negative sentiment about the movie, with the author expressing disappointment in multiple aspects, such as plot and acting, and setting a low bar for viewing expectations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to this artist is credited with popularizing skiffle in britain??","completion":"Lonnie Donegan is the artist credited with popularizing skiffle in Britain. Born as Anthony James Donegan on April 29, 1931, in Glasgow, Scotland, he was a phenomenal musician, singer, and songwriter who became known as the \\"King of Skiffle.\\" His unique fusion of American folk, jazz, blues, and country music with British traditional folk tunes created an innovative sound that captivated audiences and influenced a whole generation of British musicians. Lonnie Donegan's musical journey began when he learned to play the guitar and banjo while still young. His first exposure to the music world was as a member of several British jazz bands in the early 1950s. However, his breakthrough came when he joined Chris Barber's Jazz Band, where he performed not only as a guitarist and banjo player but also as a vocalist. It was during this period that he began experimenting with skiffle music and developing his distinctive style. In 1954, while still with Chris Barber's band, Donegan recorded a skiffle song called \\"Rock Island Line,\\" which was initially released as a B-side. The song unexpectedly became a massive hit, reaching No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 1956. This success led Donegan to pursue a solo career, and he soon became a skiffle sensation all across Britain. Lonnie Donegan's unique skiffle style was characterized by uptempo and energetic tunes, often featuring simple lyrics and catchy melodies. He used an array of instruments, such as the guitar, banjo, washboard, and tea-chest bass, to create a vibrant, rhythmic sound that resonated with the British youth. Skiffle became a significant DIY music movement in the mid-1950s, as thousands of teenagers picked up cheap, readily available instruments to form skiffle groups of their own. Over the course of his career, Donegan produced numerous hits, including \\"Cumberland Gap,\\" \\"Don't You Rock Me Daddy-O,\\" \\"Puttin' On The Style,\\" \\"Gamblin' Man,\\" and \\"My Old Man's a Dustman.\\" In total, he scored over 30 Top 30 hits in the UK. He also regularly appeared on television and radio shows, further extending skiffle's influence on the British music scene. Lonnie Donegan's impact on the British music scene was profound. His skiffle sound inspired a new generation of artists, including The Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and Van Morrison, who have all cited Donegan as a significant influence in their early music careers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, as skiffle's popularity waned and rock 'n' roll took center stage, many artists transitioned from skiffle to rock, carrying with them the musical energy and enthusiasm that Donegan had instilled in them. Lonnie Donegan passed away on November 3, 2002. Still, his legacy as the artist who popularized skiffle in Britain endures, and his influence on British popular music continues to be celebrated and recognized."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please answer the following question: When a scary event happened in the movie they were watching, Quinn dug their nails into Casey's fingers. Given the context: Why did Quinn do this? Possible answers: impress Casey with their nails, be at a movie, calm down after being frightened Answer:","completion":"Quinn's digging their nails into Casey's fingers during a scary event in the movie can be best explained as an involuntary reaction to calm down after being frightened. When encountering a scary or tense situation, people often have various physical and emotional responses. These include increased heart rate, rapid breathing, sweating, and sometimes an involuntary need for physical contact or a grounding sensation. Releasing this tension or fear through physical action can help the person to relieve stress and regain control of their emotions. In this situation, Quinn was likely experiencing a heightened sense of fear and anxiety due to the scary event in the movie. They may have been feeling overwhelmed or tense, which contributed to their heightened emotional state. Dipping their nails into Casey's fingers, although unintentional, served as a coping mechanism for Quinn to redirect their fear and anxiety through physical contact. This action allowed Quinn to have a sense of connection and grounding, which helped them to calm down and regulate their emotions. It's important to note that Quinn's actions weren't to impress Casey with their nails or just because they were at a movie. The sudden scare triggered their physiological and emotional response, leading to this involuntary action as an attempt to self-soothe and regain control. In such scenarios, people often seek physical contact with someone they are close to or comfortable with as a way to feel safer and more secure. This physical touch acts as a comforting reassurance and can help in reducing the intensity of fear while providing emotional support. In conclusion, Quinn's act of digging their nails into Casey's fingers during the scary event in the movie can be attributed to their need to calm down after being frightened. This involuntary reaction serves as a coping mechanism that allows Quinn to gain a sense of control and grounding, ultimately helping them to recover from the overwhelming fear and anxiety they experienced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: According to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we are time. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \\"being ahead of oneself\\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.

Darren Wilson isn't expected to face civil rights charges over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last August after an F.B.I. investigation found no evidence to support charges, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday. The Justice Department has yet to make any official announcement, but sources close to the department have said such a prosecution would be unlikely, in part because of the extraordinarily high legal standard federal prosecutors would need to meet. Wilson was cleared in November by a state grand jury in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, a shooting that touched off protests in the streets and became part of a national conversation about race relations and police departments that patrol minority neighborhoods. Scroll down for video. Darren Wilson isn't expected to face civil rights charges over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown last August after an F.B.I. investigation found no evidence to support charges. Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson in the days after the shooting to calm tensions and meet with Brown's family and law enforcement. Wilson, who shot Brown after a scuffle in the middle of the street, told the grand jury that reviewed the case that he feared for his life when Brown hit him and reached for his gun. Some witnesses have said Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. To mount a federal prosecution, the Justice Department would need to show that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. That standard, which means prosecutors must prove that an officer knowingly used more force than the law allowed, is challenging for the government to meet. Multiple high-profile police-involved deaths, including the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York City, have not resulted in federal charges. Attorney General Eric Holder visited Ferguson in the days after the shooting to calm tensions and meet with Brown's family and law enforcement. Protests in Ferguson: A separate, broader Justice Department-led investigation into the practices of the Ferguson police department remains open. Wilson, who had been on administrative leave since the shooting, resigned days after the grand jury decision. A separate, broader Justice Department-led investigation into the practices of the Ferguson police department remains open. That investigation, which will examine potential racial bias among officers, has the potential to have more sweeping consequences than any individual criminal prosecutions, experts say. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justice Department lawyers were preparing a memo recommending against prosecuting Wilson, but that the memo was not yet complete and that Attorney General Eric Holder — who is expected to leave his position within weeks — had not yet made a decision. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Brown's family, said in a statement that the family would not address speculation from anonymous officials and was waiting for an official Justice Department announcement. Wilson was cleared in November by a state grand jury in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, a shooting that touched off protests in the streets. Neil Bruntrager, an attorney for Wilson, said Wilson's lawyers had received no communications from the Justice Department and would not comment until there was a final determination. 'We don't believe he has done anything that would merit any kind of a prosecution or any kind of civil rights claims and we are just awaiting the outcome like everybody else,' Bruntrager said in a telephone interview.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person whose music career began in Memphis in 1954, recording at Sun Records? Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?, using the article: Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling..., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (Spanish: [ale'xandro xodo'rofski]; born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean-French filmmaker. Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. In 2000, Jodorowsky won the Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF). Jodorowsky attended the festival and his films were shown, including El Topo and The Holy Mountain, which at the time had grey legal status. According to festival director Bryan Wendorf, it was an open question of whether CUFF would be allowed to show both films, or whether the police would show up and shut the festival down. Until 2007, Fando y Lis and Santa Sangre were the only Jodorowsky works available on DVD. Neither El Topo nor The Holy Mountain were available on videocassette or DVD in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to ownership disputes with distributor Allen Klein. After settlement of the dispute in 2004, however, plans to re-release Jodorowsky's films were announced by ABKCO Films. On 19 January 2007, the website, announced that on 1 May 2007, Anchor Bay released a box set including El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and Fando y Lis. A limited edition of the set includes both the El Topo and The Holy Mountain soundtracks. And, in early February 2007, Tartan Video announced its 14 May 2007, release date for the UK PAL DVD editions of El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and the six-disc box set which, alongside the aforementioned feature films, includes the two soundtrack CDs, as well as separate DVD editions of Jodorowsky's 1968 debut feature Fando y Lis (with his 1957 short La cravate a.k.a. Les tetes interverties, included as an extra) and the 1994 feature-length documentary La constellation Jodorowsky. Notably, Fando y Lis and La cravate were digitally restored extensively and remastered in London during late 2006, thus providing the perfect complement to the quality restoration work undertaken on El Topo and The Holy Mountain in the States by Abkco, and ensuring that the presentation of Fando y Lis is a significant improvement over the 2001 Fantoma DVD edition. Prior to the availability of these legitimate releases, only inferior quality, optically censored, bootleg copies of both El Topo and The Holy Mountain have been circulated on the Internet and on DVD. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Jodorowsky attempted to make a sequel to El Topo, called at different times The Sons of El Topo and Abel Cain, but could not find investors for the project. In an interview with Premiere Magazine, Jodorowsky said he intended his next project to be a gangster film called King Shot. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper in November 2009, however, Jodorowsky revealed that he was unable to find the funds to make King Shot, and instead would be entering preparations on Sons of El Topo, for which he claimed to have signed a contract with \\"some Russian producers\\". In 2010, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City staged the first American cinema retrospective of Alejandro Jodorowsky entitled Blood into Gold: The Cinematic Alchemy of Alejandro Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky would attend the retrospective and hold a master class on art as a way of transformation. This retrospective would inspire the museum MOMA PS1 to present the exhibition Alejandro Jodorowsky: The Holy Mountain in 2011. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did this mean","completion":"Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky is a talented man from Chile who also has French nationality. He was born on February 17, 1929, and he has done many artistic things in his life, like making movies, writing stories and poems, acting, directing plays, making music, and even drawing and painting. His movies are special and can sometimes surprise people with strange pictures and ideas about religion and other things. His parents were originally from Ukraine, and he had a difficult childhood, so he spent a lot of time reading and writing. In 2000, Alejandro Jodorowsky was given a special award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF) for all the great work he did throughout his life. Some of his movies were shown there, even though there were some legal problems about them at that time. Later in 2007, more of his movies were released on DVDs, which made it easier for people to watch them at home. During the years, Alejandro Jodorowsky also tried to make a new movie that would be a sequel to an older movie called \\"El Topo,\\" but he couldn't find enough money for it. He also wanted to make a different movie about gangsters, but he couldn't find enough money for that one either. However, in 2009 he said he was going to make the sequel to \\"El Topo\\" with the help of some producers from Russia. In 2010 and 2011, museums in New York City celebrated his amazing work through exhibitions and movie screenings. To sum it up, Alejandro Jodorowsky is a very talented man who makes special movies and has done many different artistic things in his life. Even though sometimes he faced challenges, his work is still getting celebrated and admired by people around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices: - muscles - bones - tendons - tissues A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Organs are groups of tissues working together. To provide a detailed explanation, an organ is a specialized structure within an organism that performs a specific function. Organs usually consist of various types of tissues working in harmony to ensure the proper functioning of the organ. These tissues are collections of cells bound together by specialized extracellular matrices and are classified into four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue. Epithelial tissue lines the outer and inner surfaces of the body and protects the underlying structures. Connective tissue provides support, connects, and separates different types of tissues and cells. Muscle tissue has the ability to contract and facilitate movement, while nervous tissue is responsible for transmitting electrical signals throughout the body. Organs form systems in collaboration with other organs. For example, the heart consists of muscle tissue (cardiac muscle) that pumps blood, while connective tissue forms the valves and vessels. Nervous tissue is responsible for conducting electrical impulses to regulate the heartbeat, and epithelial tissue lines the vessels. In conclusion, organs are groups of tissues working together to perform vital functions within an organism. These tissues comprise specialized cells that collaborate and interact with each other, contributing to the overall efficiency and functionality of the organ and organism as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the increasing prevalence of vaping and e-cigarette usage among adolescents, this mission is now more critical than ever, as it seeks to protect the health and well-being of future generations. A Troubling Trend: The Rise of Teen Tobacco Use While significant progress has been made in reducing overall rates of tobacco consumption, this hard-won success is now under threat due to the rapid increase in teen smoking and vaping. Studies show that more than one in four American high school students are using e-cigarettes, a statistic that demonstrates the importance of immediate intervention to combat this alarming trend. The Clinton and State Officials' Plan of Attack To address the growing menace of teen tobacco consumption, Clinton and state officials are proposing the implementation of stricter measures to prevent access and exposure to these harmful substances. Some of the key steps outlined in this proposed plan are as follows: 1. Increasing the legal purchasing age for tobacco products: By raising the minimum age requirement for purchasing tobacco products to 21, state officials and Clinton believe that this will significantly reduce the availability of these products to minors. This move is expected to help curb the negative influence of peer pressure on underage smokers, as older friends will no longer be able to legally purchase cigarettes for their underage companions. 2. Enhanced enforcement of existing laws: There will be a renewed commitment to ensuring that retailers who sell tobacco products fully comply with existing laws and regulations. This includes stricter penalties for those found in violation of these laws. Additionally, there will be increased funding for law enforcement agencies to help with the surveillance and prosecution of illegal activities related to tobacco sales. 3. Expanded education initiatives: State officials and Clinton recognize that education and awareness are critical components in the fight against teen smoking. Educational campaigns targeted at minors will be ramped up to underscore the health risks associated with smoking, as well as effective strategies for quitting and avoiding tobacco products altogether. 4. Regulation of e-cigarette sales and advertisements: With e-cigarettes being a significant contributor to the rise in teen tobacco use, there will be a push for the implementation of stricter regulations on the sale and marketing of these products. This includes restricting the appeal of e-cigarettes to minors via marketing and advertising, as well as requiring retailers to obtain licenses for the sale of these nicotine delivery devices. Conclusion The collaboration between former President Clinton and state officials signals a new chapter in the battle against teen smoking. By implementing comprehensive, evidence-based strategies aimed at protecting the health of future generations, there is a renewed hope that the tide can be turned in the fight against teen tobacco use. However, this will require continued dedication and vigilance on behalf of parents, educators, and legislators alike to make a meaningful and lasting difference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A university professor has decided to live inside a dumpster for an entire year in a radical experiment to see if people would be happier living a simpler lifestyle. After formulating and finalising his plans for the undertaking last year, Professor Jeff Wilson has now been housed in the 36-square-foot container for more than seven months. He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer. Scroll down for video. Professor Jeff Wilson has been living in this dumpster for seven months now and says he may yet stay for another year. The dumpster was large enough to fit a bed and a few pieces of Mr Wilson's (pictured) furniture. But it was just an empty barren space before he filled it with his possessions. Mr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas, USA, said the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster. The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter. Having now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project. However, managing the smells from the toilet can also be an issue. He said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life. 'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing. 'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.' Professor Jeff Wilson (left) holds a PhD in Environmental Science, while pictured right is the storage space below the dumpster which contains his belongings. Mr Wilson's bed and living space inside the dumpster. He admits managing the toilet smells can be an issue. Maintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until Mr Wilson built temperature controls.

The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \\"in\\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject. Try saying: \\"I'm sorry. I should have known better\\" or \\"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\\" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny... Question: Which of the following best describes the writer's opinion on joke-telling? - Nobody knows what makes a joke funny. - We should not tell jokes unless we are asked to do so. - Joke-telling is a very complex thing. - Jokes should be told only to friends and family members.

Some possible feelings could include: 1. Nervousness or anxiety: Being called up to the stage and put on the spot, especially in front of an audience, can be nerve-wracking for many people. Jordan might feel his heart racing and palms sweating as he anticipates what comes next. 2. Excitement: Being singled out and acknowledged by Sasha could be very exciting for Jordan, especially if he admires or respects Sasha. This moment could be one he had dreamed of or hoped for, and now it is becoming a reality. 3. Curiosity: Depending on the context, Jordan might be curious about why Sasha called him up to the stage. Is it for an award? To discuss a topic? To participate in an activity? This sense of curiosity will likely grow the closer he gets to the stage. 4. Gratitude: If Jordan perceives this as a positive experience, he could feel grateful for the opportunity to be in the spotlight or to engage with Sasha in a more direct way. 5. Fear: In some cases, fear might be part of Jordan's emotional response. He could worry about making a mistake, saying the wrong thing, or embarrassing himself in front of Sasha and the audience.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I saw one last night on an episode of Designated Survivor. To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious. Question: Why did the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so? Options: A. because there was no password B. because the agent walked to the car C. because the car started D. not enough information === The correct answer is The answer is:","completion":"C. because the car started. The reason the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so is because the car started. In the scene described, the agent used the Ford app on her phone to remotely start the vehicle. This action, in turn, initiated the dashboard lights and other vehicle systems, preparing the car for the agent to drive it. The display of colorful dash lights is a common feature in modern vehicles upon starting up, and it is an indicator that the car is functioning properly and is ready for use. The other options presented in the question do not directly relate to the dash lighting up: A. The absence of a password on the agent's phone does raise concerns about security and the authenticity of the scene. However, this fact is irrelevant to the dash lights coming on when the car starts. B. The agent walking towards the car does not specifically cause the dash lights to turn on. It might show her intention to use the vehicle, but the act of the car starting is the primary cause for the lights to illuminate. D. There is sufficient information provided to conclude that the car starting is the reason for the dash lights turning on in this situation. The detailed description of the scene allows the reader to understand the relationship between the agent using the Ford app and the car's lights activating. It is essential to remember that product placements could sometimes disrupt the natural flow of a scene, but they serve a purpose in financing and promoting both the product and the movie or TV show. In this case, the Ford app and the Ford F150 were showcased through the agent's interactions, but it might have come across as clumsy or forced to the viewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available choices: (i) no. (ii) yes.","completion":"Traditional gender roles exist due to a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors that have evolved over thousands of years. There are several reasons for the development and persistence of these roles, which include evolutionary biology, division of labor, social constructs, and historical practices. 1. Evolutionary biology: One reason for the existence of traditional gender roles is evolutionary biology. Males and females in various species, including humans, have evolved different physical traits and abilities that influence their roles in society. For example, males tend to be larger and have greater physical strength, making them more effective in tasks requiring physical power and endurance. Females, on the other hand, are better equipped for childbirth and caring for young offspring due to their reproductive systems and biologically driven nurturing instincts. 2. Division of labor: As human societies developed, the division of labor became more and more essential for survival and progress. Roles and responsibilities were apportioned based on physical abilities, skills, and resources. Men were generally better suited for hunting, fishing, and protecting the group from external threats, while women were responsible for gathering food, caring for children, and managing the household. This division of labor ensured greater specialization and efficiency in performing necessary tasks, and it subsequently reinforced traditional gender roles. 3. Social constructs: Traditional gender roles are also shaped by sociocultural factors and norms that perpetuate particular expectations and behaviors. Throughout history, societies have created specific roles for men and women, which often reflect prevailing belief systems, values, and religious practices. In many cultures, men are seen as the providers and protectors, while women are typically responsible for nurturing and maintaining the family unit. Over time, these social constructs become ingrained in the collective consciousness and continue to be passed down through generations, further cementing traditional gender roles. 4. Historical practices: Many societies have longstanding practices and customs that uphold traditional gender roles. For example, property inheritance and lineage were often traced through the male bloodline, granting men greater economic power and influence. Women, on the other hand, were often denied education, the right to work (outside the home), own property, or participate in political processes, which further reinforced their subordinate status and traditional roles. To answer the second question, traditional gender roles were determined by a combination of factors, including evolutionary biology, societal needs for the division of labor, sociocultural constructs, and longstanding historical practices. These factors have continuously interacted to establish the roles and expectations associated with each gender. Regarding the multi-choice problem, I would say that these questions are connected but not the same: (ii) yes. While both questions explore the origin and existence of traditional gender roles, the first question seeks to understand why they exist, and the second question asks how they were determined. The answers to both questions are interrelated, but they address different aspects of the broader issue of gender roles in societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Zheng He (Chinese: Zheng He ; 1371-1433 or 1435) was a Chinese mariner, explorer, diplomat, fleet admiral, and court eunuch during China's early Ming dynasty. He was originally born as Ma He in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. Context: In the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the Yongle and Xuande Emperors' official annals was incomplete and even erroneous; other official publications omitted them completely. Although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages, it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions - unauthorized by (and in fact, counter to) the injunctions of the dynastic founder - presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty. State-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the surviving Yuan Mongols from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress, less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new Jingtai era. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the Great Wall of China. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen. However, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them: the History of Ming records imperial edicts forbidding Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years. Question: was there a war Answer:","completion":"No, there was not a specific war related to Zheng He's voyages. However, there were conflicts and military pressures faced by China during and after Zheng He's expeditions, particularly from the surviving Yuan Mongols in the north. This led to a shift in focus and resources from naval expeditions to strengthening land defenses, such as the Great Wall of China. Although Zheng He's voyages involved diplomacy and trade, the expeditions did not lead to or center around a war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2013*,D)When asked about happiness,we usually think of something extraordinary,an absolute delight,which seems to get rarer the older we get. For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her. We,however,with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area,have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have.We're so selfconscious about our \\"right\\" to it that it's making us miserable.So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success,without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us-it's about how we see what happens to us.It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.It's not wishing for what we don't have,but enjoying what we do possess. People who equal happiness with wealth and success _ . A) consider pressure something blocking their way B) stress their right to happiness too much C) are at a loss to make correct choices D) are more likely to be happy A:","completion":"B) stress their right to happiness too much According to the passage, people who equate happiness with wealth and success are so focused on their \\"right\\" to happiness that it's making them miserable.

Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus. The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the 2007 NBA Playoffs as the Easts second seed. In Game 5 of the NBA Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Clevelands last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the 2006-07 Detroit Pistons season. After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \\"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \\"Michael Jordan-esque\\". In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs season in the 2007 NBA Finals. During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, and Cleveland was eliminated in a Whitewash (sport). Question: In which categories did James' average higher in the championship round compared to his season average? Answer:","completion":"During the championship round of the 2007 NBA Finals, LeBron James saw an increase in his average in certain statistical categories compared to his season average. Specifically, his rebounds and assists per game saw an increase in the championship round. In the 2006-07 NBA regular season, LeBron James had the following averages per game: - 27.3 points - 6.7 rebounds - 6.0 assists - 1.6 steals In the 2007 NBA Finals championship round, James had the following averages per game: - 22.0 points - 7.0 rebounds - 6.8 assists - an unspecified number of steals (but not mentioned as increased, so we assume it's less or equal to 1.6) Comparing these two sets of averages, we can determine the categories in which James had higher averages during the championship round: - Rebounds per game: James saw a slight increase in his rebounding average, going from 6.7 during the regular season to 7.0 in the championship round. - Assists per game: Similarly, his assists average also increased, from 6.0 in the regular season to 6.8 in the championship round. It is important to note that despite these increases in averages, LeBron James' overall performance in the 2007 NBA Finals was not as effective as it was during the regular season, as evidenced by his reduced shooting percentage (35.6%) and scoring average (22 points) in the Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers were eventually swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the series, signifying that the increased averages in rebounds and assists were not enough to secure a championship for the team."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Von Ryan's Express Movie plot: August 1943- Nazi-occupied Italy. An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to coutermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname \\"Von Ryan.\\" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes. As punishment, Ryan is placed in the sweat box while the men receive their clean clothing.Some time later, Ryan's fellow inmates release him from the box with the welcome news that the Allies have... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Von Ryan's Express,\\" the prisoners, led by Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra) and Major Fincham (Trevor Howard), devise a daring and carefully planned escape from the train cars. The escape plan involves several key steps, which I will outline below: 1. Gathering Information and Resources: The prisoners start by gathering as much information as possible about the train and its route. They study the schedules, guard patterns, and the train's layout. They also procure necessary tools and equipment to aid in their escape, such as lock picks, makeshift weapons, and uniforms of German soldiers. 2. Creating a Distraction: The prisoners devise schemes to divert the attention of the German guards, such as faking illnesses, staging fights, or creating chaos within the train cars. This serves to distract the guards and provides opportunities for the prisoners to make their moves. 3. Neutralizing the Guards: Once the distractions are in play, the prisoners work together to neutralize the German guards on the train. They do this by ambushing the guards as discreetly and quietly as possible, using their makeshift weapons and hand-to-hand combat skills. They then take the guards' uniforms and weapons, which they will use later to blend in and evade suspicion. 4. Unlocking the Train Cars: With the guards neutralized, the prisoners can begin picking the locks on the train car doors. They must work quickly and quietly to avoid detection by any remaining guards or the train's driver. Once the locks are open, the prisoners can start to make their move. 5. Exiting the Train and Sabotaging the Tracks: The prisoners use the stops at stations or slower parts of the route as their opportunity to exit the train. They carefully time their jumps, ensuring they land safely and avoid capture. Once off the train, the prisoners split into smaller groups and proceed to sabotage the train tracks, making it difficult for the train to continue on its intended path or for any pursuers to follow them. 6. Evasion and Regrouping: After successfully exiting the train and sabotaging the tracks, the prisoners must evade capture by the Germans and blend into their surroundings. They utilize their stolen uniforms, deception, and knowledge of the terrain to elude any pursuers. The prisoners then regroup at a predetermined rendezvous point, where they can make further plans for their escape from occupied Italy. In summary, the prisoners' escape from the train cars in \\"Von Ryan's Express\\" is a meticulously planned and executed operation. Through a combination of distractions, stealth, quick thinking, and teamwork, they manage to break free from captivity and continue their journey toward freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks.

Translate to English English:","completion":"The economic potential of the temporary movement of service providers is particularly emphasized in the European migration program (11). The European migration program highlights the significance of temporary movement of service providers in terms of economic potential. This program aims to facilitate and encourage a more efficient allocation of resources, promote economic development, and foster growth within the European market. By allowing service providers to temporarily move and work in different countries, the program supports the exchange of knowledge, skills, and expertise among various regions. This, in turn, contributes to the overall competitiveness and innovation within the European economy. Within the context of the European migration program, the temporary movement of service providers may take several forms. This includes intra-corporate transfers of employees from one branch to another, self-employed individuals providing services to clients in other Member States, and temporary work assignments for professionals in sectors such as ICT, healthcare, research and development, and engineering. One of the key benefits of the temporary movement of service providers is the opportunity for companies to access a wider range of skills and competencies. When professionals move from one country to another, they bring with them expertise that may be scarce or unavailable in the local labor market. This, in turn, can help address skills gaps and drive innovation in the receiving country. Furthermore, the temporary movement of service providers can contribute to greater economic integration within the European Union. This is achieved by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among companies and professionals from different Member States. As a result, the European market becomes more connected, benefiting from increased competitiveness and economies of scale. As the temporary movement of service providers is an important aspect of the European migration program, several measures have been put in place to support this type of mobility. These include the EU Blue Card Directive, which aims to facilitate the entry and residence of highly-skilled, non-EU workers, and the Posted Workers Directive, which ensures fair working conditions for employees temporarily working in another Member State. In conclusion, the economic potential of the temporary movement of service providers is a key aspect of the European migration program. By fostering greater mobility among professionals, this program aims to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and innovation within the European market. Furthermore, the temporary movement of service providers contributes to addressing skills gaps and fostering greater economic integration among Member States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Expand this summary.","completion":"In a heart-wrenching appeal to the international community, a Saudi Arabian mother is pleading for intervention on behalf of her son, Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who faces a gruesome punishment of beheading and crucifixion of his corpse. Nusra al-Ahmed, the mother of the accused, has solicited help from President Obama in particular, as she believes he can use his global influence to save her son. The incident that resulted in al-Nimr's conviction occurred when he was just a 17-years-old, participating in anti-government protests. His mother claims that her son was protesting peacefully and did not steal any property or commit violent acts. Although al-Nimr's final appeal has been rejected, his mother remains hopeful as she describes the emotional turmoil her family is in. Describing her son's torture in custody, she recalls not recognizing him when she visited him in prison. Advocates for al-Nimr argue that he is being subjected to such a severe punishment only to deter other protesters, and criticize Saudi Arabia for its treatment of a juvenile whose actions were non-violent. While President Obama has yet to publicly respond to the plea, an Obama administration official has mentioned that the United States is \\"deeply concerned\\" about the case and has urged the Saudi government to \\"respect universal human rights and its international obligations.\\" Ali Mohammed al-Nimr's case has brought significant attention to the overall human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, with various international human rights organizations stating that the Saudi government has been using executions to suppress dissent, quell protests, and silence political opponents. Additionally, the case has raised questions about rules and regulations surrounding juvenile convicts internationally. As Nusra al-Ahmed appeals to President Obama and the international community, it is a potent reminder of the strength and courage shared by families who face such harrowing circumstances. She speaks with humility and sincere belief in the inherent goodness of people, hoping her pleas will be heard and that her son will be rescued from what she terms as a \\"great tragedy.\\" Whether or not President Obama chooses to interfere in this case, his decision could determine the fate of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, and set a precedent for how the international community handles such human rights violations in the future."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Deepstar Six Movie plot: DeepStar Six is an experimental deep sea US Naval facility, crewed by a mix of military and civilians, now in the final week of their tour. The project is headed by Dr. Van Gelder, in order to test underwater colonization methods, while overseeing the installation of a new nuclear missile storage platform. Already nearing his deadline, Van Gelder's plans are threatened when geologist Burciaga (Elya Baskin) discovers a massive cavern system under the site. Van Gelder orders the use of depth charges to collapse the cavern, to the dismay of Dr. Scarpelli (Nia Peeples), who want to study the potentially primordial ecosystem inside. The ensuing detonation collapses part of the seabed, forming a massive fissure in the ocean floor. Submarine pilots Osborne and Hodges (Ronn Carroll, Thom Bray) send an unmanned probe to explore, but lose contact and venture in after it. Upon finding the probe, they detect a large sonar contact moments before being attacked and killed by an unseen force. The aggressor then attacks the observation pod, leaving Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard) and a dying Burciaga trapped inside as it teeters on the edge of the ravine. Captain Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) and submarine pilot McBride (Greg Evigan)- who is also Collins' paramour -attempt a rescue. They dock with the pod and rescue Collins, but the unstable hatch door closes on Laidlaw. Mortally wounded, he floods the compartment, forcing McBride and Collins to return and leave without him.

A gang of armed robbers dressed up as firefighters as a ruse to gain access to safe rooms before holding up shops at gunpoint. Darren Lloyd, 35, was the mastermind who led the group as they repeatedly raided cash-in-transit deliveries in east London, using stolen cars and false number plates. The robbers, who included a former police officer, were being watched by Flying Squad detectives as they staked out targets throughout the summer and autumn of last year. Hold-up: An armed robber, dressed in a real fireman's uniform, holds up a Co-op store after talking his way into the backroom. Today Lloyd was facing years behind bars after being found guilty of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob. Six other men had already admitted similar offences. By December the gang changed their strategy by deploying a robber inside shops, dressed in the distinctive maroon firefighter's uniform and yellow helmet to gain access to safe rooms. Lloyd planned 12 separate raids which netted at least £43,000. Some of them were cancelled at short notice. London fireman Russell Williams, 39,. was recruited to supply bona fide uniforms to ex-police officer Gary. Griffiths, 42, who wore the distinctive kit and armed himself with a. pistol to threaten shop staff and demand cash. Griffiths was caught after a detective spotted the 'distinctive features' of his former colleague on CCTV. A shopworker hands over the money to the bogus firefighters who typically used the ruse that they had been alerted to an alarm going off. Weapon recovered: An imitation firearm found in December last year as police arrested ringleader Darren Lloyd. Darren Lloyd was arrested by armed officers in December last year when he was caught red-handed as he scrambled from the wreckage of a high-powered Volvo getaway car, having crashed in to a garden during a police chase. Two imitation handguns he had discarded were found nearby and a shop till was still inside the vehicle. Lloyd's capture ended a year-long Flying Squad operation to round-up members of the robbery team, who had been committing crimes just a few streets away from their own homes in east London. Prosecutor Michael Shaw said: 'They were a pretty close-knit bunch and generally robbed locations close to where they lived, venues they were familiar with and knew how to get away from.' The robberies were clustered around Dagenham and Chadwell Heath in London. Lloyd, from Dagenham, Essex, was. convicted of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob between July 1 and December. 14 last year and four counts of having an imitation firearm with intent,. after a month-long trial at the Old Bailey. Five. others - Griffiths, Joshua McEvilley, Ben Garforth, Jason Stacey and. Peter Henderson have all admitted their involvement in the conspiracy. and will be sentenced alongside Lloyd on a date to be fixed. Facing jail: Darren Lloyd, 35, who was the mastermind behind the robberies, left, is facing a lengthy jail term after being found guilty at the Old Bailey. Gary Griffiths, right, a former Met Police officer is also facing jail for his role in the conspiracy. Facing custody: Ben Garforth and Peter Henderson have also both admitted their role in the conspiracy and will be sentenced on a date to be fixed. An. eighth man, Russell Williams, a firefighter, 39, from Cheshunt,. Hertfordshire, had previously pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. The court heard Griffiths, 42, was captured on camera inside Premier Foods in Dagenham, Essex, posing as a firefighter on December 5 last year and stealing £2,000 in takings. Griffiths could be seen asking to be directed in to a back room where he brandished an imitation firearm and took the cash. Shop assistant Sivavakeethar Sivakumaran said: 'He asked if there was a fire alarm going on and said they had some alarm on their system. 'He was in uniform and I didn't even think about it. I just thought it was a fireman. Then he came to the office and pulled a gun on me and asked for the safe.' On that occasion Lloyd, the second robber, wearing a distinctive patterned bandana across his face, waited at the front door of the shop to make sure they were not disturbed. Awaiting sentence: Frank Nesbitt, left, and Joshua McEvilley who are both likely to be jailed when they are sentenced. Both men then fled in a black VW Passat which was waiting outside. Detective Constable Andy Burrows later spotted Griffiths, who he first met when he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1994, on the footage. Facing jail: Jason Stacey was the final man caught after the year-long police investigation. 'When I began I was based at Bethnal Green police station,' said Det Con Burrows. 'I met Gary Griffiths there. We both played rugby for the station side and I played against him in Sunday matches. 'He is known to me as an associate and from looking at the CCTV the person wearing the uniform is Gary Griffiths. 'There are several points in the footage when his face is directed towards the camera and it is from these shots of his face that I can recognise him. 'His face has distinctive features, especially his nose, which is broken in a few places.' After the verdict, Detective Superintendent John Kielty, from the Flying Squad, said: 'These men made a lucrative career of carrying out robberies and were a highly organised and violent team. They carefully planned their actions and targets using disguises and firearms during offences. 'The Flying Squad began a proactive operation against these armed criminals to make sure they were held to account for the fear they subjected their victims to during these robberies. 'The gang were responsible for a significant number of crimes in Dagenham and the surrounding areas and I'm very pleased at today's convictions which bring an end to this complex investigation by the Flying Squad.' Dave Brown, Assistant Commissioner for the London Fire Brigade's Operations and Mobilising, said: 'If members of the public have any concerns about the identity of our staff they should ask to see their ID card. If people are still unsure they can call the number on the card to verify the identity of the firefighter.'

Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

Answer based on context: The Armenian army kept advancing and occupied most Armenian dominated villages in the Lori/Borchali province, then proceeded to enter the town Bolnisi-Knachen near heavily fought Katharinenfeld and rested only a few dozen kilometers away from the Georgian capital. Even though attacking Tbilisi was not a primary goal for the Armenians it was an alarming immediate threat to the Georgian government. The mobilization order was not issued earlier than December 18 and approved only 2 days later. Commander Jugheli was put in charge of the ill-disciplined Georgian National Guard troops in Katharinenfeld while general Akhmetashvili was appointed commander in chief of the Georgian army forces in the Lori theatre. Jugheli's 600 men encamped in a poorly and carelessly organised position without even posting guards allowing Armenian militia to sneak up on them overnight and capture several canons and machineguns and position themselves on the roofs to surprise the Georgians. However, despite the momentum the Armenians had gained, the Georgians with Jugheli leading them while under attack managed to recapture the equipment in close combat and forced the Armenians out of town, but with heavy casualties, losing 30 killed and 70 wounded. The Armenians also suffered heavy losses during retreat with 100 killed and 100 taken prisoner when they were run down by Georgian cavalry led by Colonel Cholokashvili.

Q: Background Paragraph: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Story: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land.

Please answer the following question: Robin forced himself upon Casey who resisted immediately and forcefully. Given the context: What will Casey want to do next? Possible answers: not a man of good character, laugh next, express anger next Answer:","completion":"In this situation, Casey would most likely want to express anger next. This is because Robin has forcefully imposed himself upon them, despite their immediate and strong resistance. Such behavior is a direct violation of Casey's personal boundaries, autonomy, and consent. As a result, Casey is likely to feel threatened, disrespected, and violated. Expressing anger is a natural response to such a situation as it is a way for an individual to assert their boundaries and convey their feelings of discomfort and violation. Casey would want to communicate their disapproval of Robin's actions and make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable. It is important to recognize that the answer options provided imply different reactions from Casey. Here's a brief analysis of the other two possibilities: 1. Not a man of good character: This statement seems to be a judgment of Robin's character rather than a direct response to the situation. While Casey might certainly feel that Robin's actions reflect poorly on him and form a negative opinion about his character, it does not address Casey's immediate reaction to the act. 2. Laugh next: This response would be highly unlikely in this context. Laughter is typically associated with humor, amusement, or relief, none of which are relevant emotions for Casey to experience given the situation. In fact, laughing in response to such an act might be misinterpreted as condoning or downplaying the severity of Robin's actions, which would be contrary to Casey's feelings of discomfort and the need to convey their disapproval. In conclusion, given the context of the situation, Casey would most probably want to express anger next as it allows them to assert boundaries, convey feelings of violation, and communicate their disapproval of Robin's actions. This reaction would be more in line with their emotions and overall response in comparison to the other answer options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Allen Welsh Dulles (; April 7, 1893 - January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and its longest-serving director to date. As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat, Operation Ajax (the overthrow of Iran's elected government), the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission. Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. DCI Smith recruited Dulles to oversee the agency's covert operations as Deputy Director for Plans, a position he held from January 4, 1951. On August 23, 1951, Dulles was promoted to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, second in the intelligence hierarchy. After the election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Bedell Smith shifted to the Department of State and Dulles became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence. The Agency's covert operations were an important part of the Eisenhower administration's new Cold War national security policy known as the \\"New Look\\". At Dulles' request, President Eisenhower demanded that Senator Joseph McCarthy discontinue issuing subpoenas against the CIA. In March 1950, McCarthy had initiated a series of investigations into potential communist subversion of the Agency. Although none of the investigations revealed any wrongdoing, the hearings were potentially damaging, not only to the CIA's reputation but also to the security of sensitive information. Documents made public in 2004 revealed that the CIA, under Dulles' orders, had broken into McCarthy's Senate office and fed disinformation to him in order to discredit him, in order to stop his investigation of communist infiltration of the CIA. In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force conducted a competition for a new photo reconnaissance aircraft. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's Skunk Works submitted a design number called the CL-282, which married sailplane-like wings to the body of a supersonic interceptor. This aircraft was rejected by the Air Force, but several of the civilians on the review board took notice, and Edwin Land presented a proposal for the aircraft to Dulles. The aircraft became what is known as the U-2 'spy plane', and it was initially operated by CIA pilots. Its introduction into operational service in 1957 greatly enhanced the CIA's ability to monitor Soviet activity through overhead photo surveillance. The aircraft eventually entered service with the Air Force. The Soviet Union shot down and captured a U-2 in 1960 during Dulles' term as CIA chief. Dulles is considered one of the essential creators of the modern United States intelligence system and was an indispensable guide to clandestine operations during the Cold War. He established intelligence networks worldwide to check and counter Soviet and eastern European communist advances as well as international communist movements. What was \\"New Look\\" about?","completion":"The \\"New Look\\" was a national security policy adopted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration in the United States during the early years of the Cold War. This policy aimed to address the growing tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union by focusing on a cost-effective strategy that relied on nuclear deterrence and a strong, technologically advanced military. The New Look policy sought to achieve several objectives: 1. Reduce defense spending without compromising national security: By prioritizing the development of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, the U.S. could maintain a strong military deterrent against the Soviet Union with a smaller, more affordable military force. 2. Maintain a strong nuclear deterrent: The policy emphasized the importance of a powerful nuclear arsenal for both offensive and defensive purposes, recognizing that the threat of mutually assured destruction would discourage aggression from both superpowers. 3. Utilize covert operations to counter Soviet influence: Under the New Look policy, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was given a more prominent role in international affairs, conducting covert operations to counter Soviet influence and support friendly governments around the world. 4. Form alliances with friendly nations: The policy promoted the formation of alliances with other countries, such as NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), to strengthen collective defense efforts and provide a buffer against Soviet expansion. Overall, the New Look policy represented a shift in U.S. defense and foreign policy strategies, emphasizing the importance of nuclear power and covert operations while reducing conventional military forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next, we'll get the variable o by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll move the constant term to the other side of the equation (opposite side). To move the 24 to the other side, we subtract it from both sides of the equation: 4*o + 24 - 24 = 0 - 24 This simplifies to: 4*o = -24 Step 3: Solve for o.

Context: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard).

The narrator, being a physically smaller and somewhat odd individual, was a target for Scut's abuse. Out of the urge for revenge, they decided to concoct a plan against Scut, which involved seeking help from their friend Shan to obtain a smelly, frozen shad fish from the Saturday Farmer's Market. The task of thawing the fish took place in the lounge sink and caused quite a ruckus among the other residents who were attempting to watch TV.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Somerset Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater.

When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it.

I can use this background: The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Now, I have a new situation: Ecuador and Panama both had beautiful rivers flowing into the Pacific ocean. Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste while Panama is very eco-friendly and doesn't do that. Answer this question please: Which country dumps more chemicals into the ocean? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Ecuador dumps more chemicals into the ocean than Panama. As the background information provided states, Ecuador uses its rivers to dispose of its waste, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean. This waste could contain various chemicals and harmful particles that contribute to marine pollution. The rivers can also transport agricultural fertilizers, which have a detrimental impact on the ocean's ecosystem due to the presence of oxygen-depleting chemicals. These chemicals can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones in the ocean. On the other hand, Panama is described as being very eco-friendly and does not use its rivers to dispose of waste in the same manner as Ecuador. While it is still possible that some amount of chemicals or pollutants could inadvertently enter the water system, Panama's eco-conscious approach likely results in a much lower overall contribution of harmful substances to the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, given the different waste disposal practices of the two countries, Ecuador dumps more chemicals into the ocean compared to Panama.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: COLUMBUS, Ohio--The heart operation taking place in the pale-green operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was unusual. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient. Answer:","completion":"Which statement best describes the future of heart surgery as described in the article about robotic surgery at the Ohio State University Medical Center? A) Traditional heart surgery methods will remain dominant with little adoption of robotic techniques. B) Heart surgery will be performed exclusively by robots without any human intervention.

With Jamie's exceptional investigative skills, he decrypts the file and learns about MI 16's involvement in top-secret missions that have influenced world events. Intrigued by the information, Jamie decides to delve deeper into the agency's activities. Step 3: Developing the Plot As Jamie begins to piece together the puzzle surrounding MI 16 and Major Smith, he realizes that there is a network of high-level operatives working behind the scenes on a top-secret mission. However, no one seems to know who Major Smith is or what his true intentions are. Now caught in a web of espionage, Jamie works with Sarah, his editor, to gather information and unravel the mystery. Step 4: Adding Engaging Subplots Major Smith, meanwhile, is closing in on an underground organization that poses a significant threat to global security.

Barbara runs for help and finds a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. Then, Ben (Tony Todd) shows up to the house with a crow bar, saying there are these creatures everywhere.

He is told a Mazes and Monsters game got out of hand. Robbie Wheeling (Tom Hanks) starts college at the fictional Grant University and soon develops a group of friends, all of whom have their own personal problems and issues. JayJay (Chris Makepeace) feels marginalized by his mother who constantly redecorates his room since she can't make up her mind about the best look, Kate (Wendy Crewson) has had a series of failed relationships, Daniel's (David Wallace) parents reject his dream of becoming a video game designer, and Robbie's alcoholic mother and strict father fight constantly and he is still tormented by the mysterious disappearance of his brother Hall. They are fans of a game called Mazes and Monsters, a fantasy roleplaying game that had previously caused Robbie to get kicked out of his last school when he became too obsessed with it. Though he is reluctant, the other three students convince him to start playing again with them. Through the course of playing the game, Robbie and Kate begin a serious relationship, in which he confides in her that he still has nightmares about his missing brother.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas. This progression starts when Leo, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery. Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train. The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, Lars Von Trier, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey. This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie, and the Nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes. The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.

Sentence: Ducklings need time between hatching and brooding","completion":"The sentence \\"Ducklings need time between hatching and brooding\\" is true. According to the text, ducklings should spend around 24 hours after hatching to get used to their new surroundings. This period of time allows ducklings to adapt to the environment outside of their shells, become more stable on their feet, and regulate their body temperature. During this time, they are drying off and absorbing the remains of the yolk sac, which supplies them with essential nutrients for their first day of life. After this initial 24-hour period, the ducklings are ready to move to a brooder. A brooder is a warm, safe space where ducklings can continue to grow and develop during their first few weeks of life. This can be a plastic storage container, sturdy cardboard box, or large glass aquarium, as mentioned in the text, and it should be equipped with bedding material, a heat source, food, and water.

Article:The Institute of Public Policy Research suggests if excluded students with undiagnosed problems were included, the rate would be much higher. This figure compares with one in 50 pupils in the wider population who have a mental health condition. The government said it would be publishing plans to improve mental health services later in the year. The research comes as the number of fixed term and permanent exclusions is rising. Figures just published show that last year, some 6,685 pupils were excluded permanently from state primary, secondary and special schools. Some 35 pupils were excluded every day in 2015-16 - five more daily than in the previous year. Eight out of 10 permanent exclusions happen in secondary schools. Here, the rate of permanent exclusions has increased from 0.15% in 2014-15 to 0.17% in 2015-16 - equivalent to 17 pupils per 10,000. Overall, there were 346,000 permanent and fixed-term exclusions handed out to pupils at state-funded schools in 2014-15 - the highest number since 2009. IPPR associate fellow Kiran Gill, founder of The Difference campaign on the issue, said: \\"Theresa May says she is committed to improving mental health of young people. \\"Addressing the most vulnerable children being thrown out of England's schools is a good place to start. \\"Because unequal treatment of mental health may be an injustice, but the discrimination of school exclusions is a crime.\\" Her campaign aims to break the link between school exclusion and social exclusion in \\"a burningly unjust system\\", and ensure vulnerable young people get the good quality schooling they need to change their lives. \\"If the government is serious about real action on mental health, there needs to be dedicated funding and thought-through solutions rather than sticking plasters in the symptoms of the problem,\\" Ms Gill added. Official figures showed 99% of pupils permanently excluded from mainstream schools do not get the five good GCSEs required by many employers. According to the IPPR report, nearly two-thirds of the prison population was excluded from school at some point. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\"Any decision to exclude must be lawful, reasonable and fair and we are clear permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort, in response to a serious breach or persistent breaches of the school's behaviour policy. \\"This government is committed to working with local authorities and schools to ensure children in alternative provision receive a high-quality education. \\"We are strengthening the links between schools and NHS mental health staff and have announced plans for every secondary school to be offered mental health first aid training.\\" But Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the rise in exclusions was a \\"concerning trend\\" and the DfE should consider what was driving the exclusions. \\"NUT members tell us that as the curriculum gets narrower and children's experience of school is ever more focused on preparation for tests and exams, more students are becoming disengaged from school which in turn leads to problems with behaviour and mental health problems.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"A report by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) has found that one in three permanently excluded UK students have an identified, diagnosed mental health problem.

They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Milk\\", the main proposition that Harvey Milk is trying to defeat is Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative. This was a ballot measure in California in 1978, which sought to ban gay and lesbian people, as well as their supporters, from working in public schools in the state. The Briggs Initiative was endorsed by conservative politicians and anti-gay activists, who argued that LGBT individuals posed a threat to children. Harvey Milk, who was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California, campaigned strongly against Proposition 6. Through a series of powerful speeches and grassroots organizing, Milk worked to rally the LGBTQ+ community, as well as their allies, to stand against this discriminatory measure. Milk was successful in his efforts, as Proposition 6 ultimately failed. This victory was a significant milestone for the LGBTQ+ rights movement, showcasing the power of community organizing and the importance of having openly gay leaders in political positions. Aside from Proposition 6, Milk was also fighting against broader societal discrimination and prejudice against the LGBTQ+ community, which was manifested in police raids on gay bars, public shaming of LGBTQ+ individuals, and widespread discrimination in housing, employment, and other areas. Throughout the movie, Milk is depicted as a courageous and tireless advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, fighting not only against specific discriminatory measures like Proposition 6 but also working to change people's hearts and minds about the LGBTQ+ community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption - Question: suppose during mealtime happens, how will it affect magma is formed in the ground. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"C: no effect The process of magma formation and volcanic activity is primarily driven by geological and geothermal factors, which are independent of human activities such as mealtime. Magma is formed when rock melts due to high temperatures and pressures within the Earth's crust, and the subsequent movement of this magma through the Earth's crust is dependent on factors such as the temperature and viscosity of the magma, and the Earth's mantle convection. During mealtime, people may be engaging in various activities such as cooking, eating, or washing dishes, but these activities have no significant impact on the formation and movement of magma beneath the Earth's crust. The internal mechanisms that drive the movement and behavior of magma are separated from mealtime by vast distances, measured in miles (or kilometers) rather than feet (or meters). As a result, magma formation and the geological processes that lead to volcanic activity continue uninterrupted regardless of what is happening on the Earth's surface. Additionally, the time scale at which geological processes such as magma formation and volcanic activity occur is far different from the one we experience during our daily lives. Geological processes can take place over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years, while a mealtime typically lasts only a few minutes to an hour. Consequently, the short duration of mealtime is not a factor that can influence the long-term processes of magma formation and volcanic eruptions. In summary, mealtime has no effect on the formation of magma or the potential for volcanic activity. The processes involved in magma creation and eruption are driven by geological and geothermal factors that are independent of human activities, and they occur on time scales far different from those experienced during our daily routines, including mealtime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: cardboard box How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Accomplishing the goal of creating a cardboard box involves several steps, from designing the box, gathering materials, cutting and folding, to assembling the box. Below is a detailed guide on how to create a cardboard box. Materials and Tools: 1. Cardboard sheet: The primary material for making a cardboard box. You can use a new sheet or reuse an old one. 2. Ruler: To measure and make straight lines on the cardboard. 3. Pencil or pen: For drawing lines and marking measurements. 4. Utility knife or box cutter: For cutting the cardboard along the marked lines. 5. Cutting mat or a protected surface: To protect the work surface while cutting cardboard. 6. Packing tape or glue: To assemble and secure the box. 7. T-square or large right-angle ruler (optional): For ensuring perfect 90-degree angles. Instructions: 1. Determine the dimensions: Before starting, decide on the desired dimensions of the cardboard box. You will need the measurements for length, width, and height. 2. Prepare the cardboard: If you are reusing an old box or cardboard sheet, remove any tape, staples, or labels. Make sure the cardboard is clean and flat. 3. Layout the box design on the cardboard: Lay the cardboard on your work surface and use a ruler, pencil or pen to draw lines according to the dimensions of the box. You will be drawing a large cross shape, consisting of: - One center rectangle representing the base of the box. - Four rectangles, one for each side of the center rectangle, representing the sides of the box. - When the sides are folded up, the adjacent rectangles will make the front, back, and side walls of the box. - Note: Ensure that all sides are the same height and that the width and length of the base match the corresponding dimensions on the side panels. 4. Create flaps for securing the box: To close the top and bottom parts of the box, extend lines from each side panel to create top and bottom flaps. The flaps can be equal in length to half of the length or width of the box, depending on the preferred closing method. 5. Add notches and score lines: - For easy folding, use a ruler and the back of the utility knife to score lightly along the edges where the side panels connect to the base and where the flaps connect to the side panels. - Cut small notches on each corner where the side panels meet. This will help the corners of the box to fold more precisely, creating a clean finish. 6. Cut the cardboard: Carefully cut along the outer lines of the cross shape using the utility knife or box cutter. Be sure to cut the notches as well. 7. Fold the box: Fold the side panels upwards and along the score lines, making a 90-degree angle to form a box shape. Fold the top and bottom flaps along their respective score lines. 8. Assemble the box: Use packing tape or glue to hold the box together. - If using tape, start by taping the bottom flaps together, then do the same for the top flaps once the box is filled. - If using glue, apply it to the edges of the flaps, fold and hold in place till the glue dries. 9. Finish the box: If desired, reinforce the edges and corners with more tape for a sturdier box. After following these steps, you should have successfully created a cardboard box. You can customize the box further by adding labels, printing, or painting it, based on your needs and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:The Mercedes driver equalled the tally of Scot Jim Clark and Frenchman Alain Prost with his fourth home win in a row to add to his first win for McLaren in 2008. Hamilton's victory cut his deficit to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to just one point in the championship as the German suffered a front-left tyre failure when running third with two laps to go, dropping to seventh. The same problem had hit Vettel's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen the lap before, costing the Finn an almost certain second place, promoting Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas to a Mercedes one-two. Raikkonen recovered to finish third. Following the podiums celebrations, Hamilton went down to see the crowd, surfing on their outstretched hands and high-fiving as he ran past the adoring throng. \\"The support has been incredible this weekend,\\" he said. \\"I am so proud I could do this for you all. Now the plan is to win the championship.\\" The drama all unfolded behind Hamilton, whose 57th career victory was among the most straightforward, on a weekend which he started 20 points behind Vettel and needed everything to go his way. The 32-year-old converted pole position - earned with a spectacular lap on Saturday afternoon - into a first-corner lead and simply drove off into the distance. Hamilton was 1.6 seconds clear after the first lap before the race was neutralised by a safety car following a collision between the Toro Rosso drivers. After the restart on lap five, Hamilton edged clear, building a 3.1-second lead after 12 laps and five seconds after 18, before he began to cut loose as the pit stops approached. Suddenly Hamilton was lapping a second faster than Raikkonen, pulling out five seconds behind Raikkonen made his pit stop on lap 24, Mercedes calling Hamilton in for his stop on the next lap. Hamilton returned to the track with a 10-second lead over Raikkonen and cruised to the flag as attention now turned to the battle for the remaining podium positions. Bottas was on an inverted tyre strategy, starting on the soft tyre from ninth place after a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox. He ran long on his first stint, battling past the cars in front of him and up into fifth place by lap five and then not stopping until lap 32 and rejoined 4.2 seconds behind Vettel with 18 laps to go. Bottas was soon setting fastest laps and was on Vettel's tail by lap 42. A first attempt to pass around the outside of Stowe ended with Vettel forcing him wide, but the Ferrari driver then locked a wheel into the tight Vale corner, damaging a front tyre. Bottas swept by on the Hangar Straight a lap later and set off after Raikkonen. It looked as if the Ferrari driver would hang on until his tyre lost its tread on lap 48, Vettel's going the same way a lap later. Vettel in the early laps of the race had had a tense fight with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, the two banging wheels out of Stowe corner, Vettel forcing the Dutchman wide and the having the favour returned. Verstappen hung on but was passed at the pit stops, but he came home fourth after Ferrari's problems. The Hungarian Grand Prix on 28-30 July is the final race before F1's four-week summer break. It's a tricky circuit with a lot of long corners, and a place where Mercedes might be expected to again have an advantage over Ferrari. It is the perfect opportunity for Hamilton to take the championship lead outright for the first time this year. And Hungary is a race where Hamilton already holds the record for most wins in the history of the sport with five. Bodes well... Media playback is not supported on this device Winner Lewis Hamilton: \\"It's never easy. The team were faultless all weekend. Valtteri had an incredible drive to go from ninth. \\"I am coming out to crowd surf over there later guys!\\" Second placed Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas: \\"I'm really happy today, It was not an easy race to start from P9. The team did a perfect strategy and I just kept my head down. It's a perfect weekend and well done to Lewis.\\" Third placed Kimi Raikkonen: \\"Mercedes were just a bit faster today. And, unfortunately, unlucky situations seem to be following us at the moment. \\"It's an unfortunate situation with the tyre at the end but luckily the car stayed in one place.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: On Nov.18th, 1908, three men went up in a balloon. They started early in London. The headman was Augusta Gaudron, and the other two men were Tannar and Maitland. They had a big balloon and they were ready for a long way. Soon they heard the sea. They were carrying the usual rope, and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight. It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 meters, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand, but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice. At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed up to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 meters! Everything became icy. They were so cold that they decided to land. They came down in Poland heavily but safely. They had travelled 1,797 kilometers from London! Question: Which of the following is NOT true?

News article: US protests over Russian 'harassment' as diplomats allegedly given date rape drug The US state department has expressed concerns to the Russian government over the harassment of American officials amid reports that two diplomats were slipped date rape drugs in St Petersburg last year. A man and a woman, both US officials with diplomatic passports, were drugged while they were attending a United Nations anti-corruption conference in November 2015, state news outlet RFE/RL reported, citing unnamed officials. The incident most likely occurred in their hotel bar, investigators concluded. One diplomat had to be treated at a local hospital before being flown out of the country. Investigators were unable to gather evidence from the hospital or hotel, and Moscow said there was no evidence of drugging when Washington served it a formal note of protest. When asked about the drugging incident, spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau declined to comment on specific cases but said the state department was “troubled by the way our diplomatic and consular staff have been treated over the past two years” in Russia. “We have raised our concerns at the highest levels,” Trudeau said at a briefing. “In particular, the harassment and surveillance of our diplomatic personnel in Moscow by security personnel and traffic police has increased significantly.” Western officials and journalists in Moscow have previously reported finding signs that intruders have entered their homes. During Barack Obama’s first term, Russian agents reportedly even broke in and killed the dog of a US defense attache in Moscow. But recent incidents suggest Russian security services are increasingly resorting to bizarre and invasive intimidation tactics as tensions with the west rise. Following sanctions against Russia over the 2014 annexation of Crimea, jingoist rhetoric has grown and President Vladimir Putin has warned about “enemies from abroad” and a “fifth column” sowing unrest in Russia. American officials in Moscow have complained about mysterious nocturnal break-ins during which furniture is rearranged and televisions and lights switched on, the Washington Post reported in June. Officials have returned home to find water faucets left running and, in two cases, human excrement on their floors. US diplomats were also stopped dozens of times by traffic police this spring. The secretary of state, John Kerry, spoke with Putin about the harassment of diplomats during a March visit. But in June, a Russian federal security service guard stationed outside the US embassy in Moscow attacked a US diplomat who was trying to enter, breaking his shoulder. The Russian foreign ministry said the diplomat was an undercover CIA agent. Moscow and Washington responded with tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats. After the June incident, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: “The more the US damages relations, the harder it will be for US diplomats to work in Russia.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. The US State Department has raised concerns with the Russian government about the harassment of American officials, particularly focusing on an incident where two US diplomats were allegedly given date rape drugs while attending a United Nations anti-corruption conference in November 2015 in St. Petersburg. 2.

Bristol, Rhode Island (CNN) -- The Willcox family has long been accustomed to prolonged absences from their seafaring patriarch. In fact, run-ins with the law were not unusual, given the fact that Peter Willcox had spent decades working for the environmental activist group Greenpeace, which is well-known for its provocative, headline-grabbing protests. But no one expected the 60-year-old mariner to end up languishing in a Russian jail in the Arctic, facing up to 15 years in prison on charges of piracy. \\"The situation he's in now is just way too extreme,\\" said his wife, Maggy.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". John's personal life greatly affected his reign. Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety. It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable. John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen. John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period. The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.[nb 14] How many of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried?","completion":"None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - broken bones - pain - injury - getting hurt contact with - going down The rationale to choose \\"pain\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"Pain is the most likely result of a small episode of falling because it is a common reaction to even minor falls and can manifest in various degrees of intensity depending on the individual's tolerance and the specific circumstances of the fall. This is not to say that the other choices are not possible outcomes as well, but they are generally less likely or less common. Broken bones are less probable in a small fall, especially for younger and healthy individuals, as they would require a greater impact or fall from a higher distance. However, for the elderly or those with weakened bones, this possibility increases. Injury and getting hurt are somewhat synonymous, but again, this is not a guarantee in every small fall. Sometimes, people can fall and experience minimal to no injury at all. Going down, which implies a person falling, is more of a description of the action itself rather than an outcome or consequence of the fall.

Information: - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Orestis Makris ( Greek : ; September 30 , 1898 -- January 29 , 1975 ) was a Greek actor and tenor . He graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and first entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925 . He later joined the Papaioannou troupe , before moving to more comedic roles . Makris excelled in the portrayal of folk characters , especially the stock role of the \`\` drunkard '' . Makris also participated in about forty movies , mostly as an over-strict father . He is considered one of the most significant modern Greek actors . He was decorated with the Order of the Phoenix . He died on January 29 , 1975 in Athens and is buried at the First Cemetery in a family grave . - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Spinto (from Italian, \\"pushed\\") is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms \\"lirico-spinto\\" or \\"jugendlich-dramatisch\\" are used to denote this category of voice.) - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two.

While the given statement about the winter storm blanketing the Midwest and being one of the worst snowstorms in decades suggests that there was a significant amount of snowfall in the region, it does not inherently imply that residents made snowmen and went sledding in the fluffy white snow. There are several possible reasons for this: 1. Safety concerns: If the snowstorm was as severe as described by weather experts, it could have led to dangerous conditions such as extreme cold, slippery roads, and limited visibility, making outdoor activities like snowman-building and sledding risky or even discouraged by local authorities. 2. Accessibility: The severity of the snowstorm might have caused disruptions to transportation systems and closures of public spaces, like parks and sled hills, making it difficult for residents to access locations for winter fun. 3. Comfort level: In the case of such severe winter storms, people might choose to stay indoors to avoid the harsh weather conditions or focus on keeping their homes safe and warm. 4.

Don't worry, it's very easy, and you can do it with the help of an adult friend. Let's look at the steps to make this delicious treat! 1. Get your oven and pan ready: First things first! We need to heat our oven to the right temperature so that our cake can cook properly. Ask an adult to help you preheat the oven. In the meantime, also get a cake pan ready by greasing it with some butter. 2. Mix the eggs: Now it's time to start making the cake batter. To do this, we need to beat some eggs until they become smooth and yellow. Ask your adult helper to break the eggs and put them in a big bowl, then use a whisk or fork to mix them well. 3. Add sugar to the eggs: Pour some sugar into the bowl with the beaten eggs. Keep mixing everything until the sugar dissolves, and the mixture becomes lighter in color and a little bubbly. It should look like a soft, pale yellow foam. 4. Time for some oil and a touch of vanilla: Now, we want to make our cake more flavorful, so let's add some oil and a little bit of vanilla extract. Pour these two ingredients into the bowl and mix everything together one more time. 5. Gather the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, we need to mix together some flour, salt, baking powder, and spices. These will help our cake turn fluffy and taste super yummy! Stir them well with a spoon until everything is nicely combined. 6. Combine wet and dry ingredients: Now it's time to bring our wet and dry ingredients together to make our cake batter. Carefully pour the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, and then gently stir everything until it is smooth and well-mixed. 7. Add the magical ingredient – carrots!: Last but not least, it's time to add our star ingredient – the carrots! We need to fold the grated carrots into the mixture. This means you should gently mix the carrots into the batter without stirring too hard, to keep our cake nice and fluffy. And that's it, little chefs! Now you have your carrot cake batter ready. With the help of your adult assistant, pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake it in the preheated oven. Once it's done, let it cool down and enjoy your delicious homemade carrot cake! Remember, baking is super fun, but always have an adult with you to help with the hot oven and sharp objects. Happy baking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Outside, the freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn, and despite Ashland's best efforts, collides with the cruise ship, sinking it.The next morning, a handful of survivors, including Marshall, his wife Margaret (Sally Ann Howes), their children Robin and Ben, a young officer named Nick (Nick Mancuso), his love interest Lori (Victoria Burgoyne), the ship's stand up comic Jackie (Saul Rubinek), and a passenger, Mrs. Morgan (Kate Reid), are adrift on a large piece of wreckage.

First of all, the casting for the movie was terrible. You feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end. Secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever.

'He just said he'd been attacked outside the school gates because of a row about a girl on Facebook. 'I rushed Akil to hospital where they initially thought he may have broken ribs and it about this time that Akil got the video of the attack emailed to him. 'I was sickened. It was a horrific attack outside the school gates just a few feet from parents. 'When I heard the pupils chanting 'kill him' I just knew there was no way my son was going back to that place. 'We have an appointment to get him into another school. 'Having spoken to other parents at Nottingham Emmanuel, bullying is a real problem which is not treated seriously by the staff.' Akil, who has been too scared to walk outside since the attack, added: 'I was walking to the bus stop when some people crowded around me. 'One started pushing me, then he started hitting me. 'It lasted about a minute and I could see people videoing it. 'It makes me sad and angry, now I want to go to a new school.'

Background: Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr. (born September 18, 1951) is an American neurosurgeon, author and politician serving as the 17th and current United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development since 2017, under the Trump Administration. Prior to his cabinet position, he was a candidate for President of the United States in the Republican primaries in 2016. Born in Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School, Carson has authored numerous books on his medical career and political stances. Context: By ninth grade, the family's financial situation had improved, his mother surprising neighbors by paying cash to buy a new Chrysler car, and the only government assistance they still relied on was food stamps. Carson attended the predominantly black Southwestern High School for ninth through 12th grades, graduating third in his class academically. In high school he played the baritone horn in the band, and participated in forensics (public speaking), chess club, and the U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program where he reached its highest rank--cadet colonel. Carson served as a laboratory assistant in the high school's biology, chemistry, physics school laboratories beginning in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, respectively, and worked as a biology laboratory assistant at Wayne State University the summer between 11th and 12th grades. In his book Gifted Hands, Carson relates that as a youth he had a violent temper. \\"As a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, and bricks, and baseball bats, and hammers,\\" Carson told NBC's Meet the Press in October 2015. He said he once tried to hit his mother on the head with a hammer over a clothing dispute, while in the ninth grade he tried to stab a friend who had changed the radio station. Fortunately, the blade broke in his friend's belt buckle. Carson said that the intended victim, whose identity he wants to protect, was a classmate, a friend, or a close relative. After this incident, Carson said that he began reading the Book of Proverbs and applying verses on anger. As a result, he states he \\"never had another problem with temper\\". In his various books and at campaign events, he repeated these stories and said he once attacked a schoolmate with a combination lock. Nine friends, classmates, and neighbors who grew up with him told CNN in 2015 they did not remember the anger or violence he has described. In response, Carson posted on Facebook a 1997 Parade Magazine issue, in which his mother verified the stabbing incident. He then questioned the extent of the effort CNN had exerted in the investigation. He has said that he protected white students in a biology lab after a race riot broke out at his high school in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. The Wall Street Journal confirmed the riot but could not find anyone who remembered Carson sheltering white students. Question: What High School did he attend?.

She's challenging international rules in order to compete in the ring wearing a hijab, a long-sleeved shirt and leggings. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Amaiya Zafar is a young girl in Minnesota who, like many her age, found a sport she loves and desperately wants to practice it, to learn more about herself and to test just how good she can become. But there are significant barriers standing in Zafar’s way. For one, the sport she fell in love with is amateur boxing. More significantly, she is a 15-year-old Muslim girl who is as devout as she is dedicated and she wants to wear a hijab, a headcovering for Muslim women, under her boxing headgear and uniform. While it’s nearly impossible for her to find opponents in her size and age groups, the bigger roadblock is that international rules that govern the sport do not allow her to wear a hijab in competition. Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should evolve with the times. “I think the rules are old school,” Zafar, who lives in Oakdale, Minn., told The Washington Post. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with getting them changed.” Her mother, Sarah O’Keefe-Zafar, believes the rule is now having unintended consequences. “I don’t think they ever intended to exclude anybody from the sport,” she told The Post. Against the odds for most young girls, Zafar fell hard for boxing two years ago when she saw the ring at a Minneapolis-area gym. Her father, Mohammad, suggested that she take up fencing, but that wasn’t for Amaiya. “I’ll box before I’ll fence,” she told him. And that was that. He helped her understand the finer points of the sport by showing her videos and teaching her about amateur boxing. Finally, she stepped into a gym and then the ring. “Everyone was like, ‘That’s Amaiya. She’s the small one,’ ” she said. Her parents, meanwhile, went from supportive to enthusiastic. “When she first trained, I came into this as a mom and a nurse,” O’Keefe-Zafar said, “but she was dedicated and trained for over a year without sparring. And I watched her go from a timid little girl to a confident young person.” Finally, she had to prove herself in the ring against an opponent. “All the boys around the ring kept telling him, ‘She’s just a girl. Punch her pretty little face off. You can’t let a girl beat you,’ ” Amaiya Zafar said. After she scored the last jab, she had the last word with the boy and his friends: “I might be a girl, but you hit like a girl.” Eventually, she found acceptance in the ring. “Now they’re my team,” she said, adding that they work out together and that “it’s fun to spar.” And when Zafar, one of three children in her family, takes a hit? “I look at it as something I did wrong defensively,” she said. “I try to learn from it and focus a lot on defense.” Zafar is a boxing purist; she won’t try to become the next Ronda Rousey. “I’m not a wrestler, I’m not a kickboxer. Amateur boxing is not like pro boxing,” she said. Rules about a hijab aren’t the only obstacle in Zafar’s way, though. She now stands 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 106 pounds; she’s always, she says, “the small one” at the gym. There aren’t a ton of possible opponents for women to begin with, let alone those in her height and weight class. In addition, opponents must be within two years of one another. And there’s the hijab. Removing it isn’t an option for a girl to whom faith matters deeply. International boxing rules stipulate that she cover neither her arms nor her legs below the knees and Zafar would like to wear a long-sleeved Under Armour shirt and leggings beneath her tank top and shorts. USA Boxing has requested a provisional ruling from AIBA, the international boxing organization to which USA boxing defers on rules. Neither USA Boxing nor AIBA responded to a number of requests for comment from The Post. Martino cited safety as a consideration for the rules. “If you’re covering up arms, if you’re covering up legs, could there be preexisting injury?” Michael Martino, the organization’s interim executive director, told MPR News’ Laura Yuen in September. “And then if someone got hurt during the event, the referee wouldn’t be able to see it.” While USA Boxing awaits some sort of ruling from AIBA’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, Martino said there was only so much officials could do. “We have 30,000 amateur boxers in the United States,” Martino said. “So if you make allowances for one religious group, what if another comes in and says we have a different type of uniform we have to wear? You have to draw a line some place.” Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Minnesota’s Council on American-Islamic Relations, told WDAZ.com that USA Boxing’s appeal was the right move. “You know, I think we are looking for an opportunity for this young girl to get a chance to do what all young teenagers [do], especially girls who want to play in this unique sport boxing and the only difference is that she’s a Muslim,” Hussein said. Zafar isn’t the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab during sports. In the spring of 2014, FIFA lifted a ban on players wearing religious head coverings during games. While she waits for the evolution of her sport, she focuses on her training. Boxing is something that is always there for her: “If I’m in a bad mood, emotional or having a bad day, my mom will say, ‘Get your butt out the door and get to the gym.’ ” While her mother says the family is “patient and hopeful” that a rule provision will come down, Zafar is taking her enthusiasm for the sport in another direction, one that brings nearly the same note of excitement to her voice as merely talking about boxing does. “I’m teaching a boxing class at the gym on Saturday mornings,” she said, “and I have eight [students] wearing hijab in the class.” Like her mother, her father sees boxing as a larger part of Amaiya’s life. “As a parent, person of faith and a person who admires integrity, determination and fight, as a father I am bursting with joy to see my daughter so strong in her quest to be the best in her faith and in life,” he wrote to The Post. “She has a competitive endeavor that flows through her actions and produces the most powerful and the most positive energy that is felt by those who know her. She gets respect by her actions and demands her place in a world through resiliency. She holds on to the rope of honor and gives back 110 percent to those she mentors. She lives by example and breathes by determination. This is my daughter Amaiya Zafar and I am her father.” After spending most of her career in traditional print sports journalism, Cindy began blogging and tweeting, first as NFL/Redskins editor, and, since August 2010, at The Early Lead. She also is the social media editor for Sports. What was this article about?","completion":"Amaiya Zafar is a 15-year-old girl who loves boxing. She is also a Muslim girl who wants to wear a hijab, a special headscarf, under her boxing gear. However, there are international rules in boxing that say she cannot wear a hijab during a match. Amaiya believes these rules are old-fashioned and wants them to change so she can keep practicing the sport she loves while also following her religious beliefs. Amaiya and her family are waiting for a decision on whether she'll be allowed to wear her hijab while boxing. In the meantime, Amaiya continues to train and teaches a boxing class for other girls who wear hijabs."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey. One week later, this dear sweet couple pulled our car all the way to our place and refused to take anything in return, except for us to pay it forward-and we have, and will continue to do it forever.

Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment: The force and energy of the waves cause water and sediment (like sand, pebbles, and rocks) near the shore to move. 3. The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper: When sediment is moved and pushed by the waves, it contributes to the erosion of the coastline by abrasion, as if a sandpaper is rubbing against the land. 4. Water washes the sediment back: After the erosion has taken place, the waves and water currents can carry the sediment back towards the coast or along the coastline. 5.

She even got into character as Princess Leia.May the \\"love\\" be with the two of you. ||||| A young Star Wars fan’s recent adoption ceremony in Delaware was attended by some very special guests who traveled from a galaxy far, far away. When 4-year-old Zoe Pedicone was officially adopted Friday by her foster mother in Wilmington, Delaware, she was surrounded by her favorite characters from the iconic franchise. As her name was officially changed, the family court judge touched a lightsaber to her forehead, Zoe’s new mom, Deanna Pedicone, tells PEOPLE. Get push notifications with news, features and more. “I wanted this day to be everything she ever wanted,” Pedicone told WPVI. “It’s only once in a lifetime that she’ll be adopted, and it’s the only time I’ll be adopting her, so I wanted it to be really special.” Star Wars favorites like Chewbacca, stormtroopers, R2-D2, Rey and Darth Vader were present — all played by volunteers, Pedicone says. The judge even got in on the fun, dressing as Princess Leia. After the formal proceedings, officials dimmed the lights in the Wilmington courtroom and played the Star Wars theme song, according to Wilmington News Journal. Zoe was placed in Pedicone’s care in 2013, and Pedicone told the News Journal that she knew she wanted to make the little girl’s official adoption extra special. “This is her day,” Pedicone told the paper. “She is old enough to remember it, and I want it to be as fun as possible.” Pedicone tells PEOPLE she got Zoe just two weeks after being licensed as a foster parent. “I describe it as the weirdest blind date ever,” she says. “They drop the kid off, they leave 20 minutes later and you sit there and wonder, ‘When is your mom going to come and get you?’ “ “One of the challenges is their story already started, so you have to figure out what the plot is,” Pedicone says. “It’s like the story is already moving and you come in at chapter 10 and you don’t really know what happened before,” she says, “so you start building that relationship and help them move in a direction that is more typical of a family: eating together at a table, sleeping in our own beds, taking a bath and not being frightened by that. … It’s a very thoughtful way to have to parent.” Pedicone says she became specially bonded to Zoe after the little girl went through a medical crisis. Her adoption application was approved in October. “That’s when I cried,” Pedicone says. “I didn’t real how much I worried about her future until someone said your application has been approved.” “The day they approved the application was the day I knew I wouldn’t have to worry about [Zoe] going anywhere,” she says. WATCH: This Man Sees New York for the First Time Through a Bionic Eye Zoe’s love for Star Wars is no secret, Pedicone tells PEOPLE. Her bedroom has a Star Wars wall sticker, an R2-D2 humidifier, a Storm Trooper teddy bear — and, of course, a Jedi lightsaber. “Some friends had sent me this really sweet video of a girl who had gotten adopted with princesses coming to her adoption and said, ‘You should do this,’ ” Pedicone says. “So I asked [Zoe]: If you could have anybody at your adoption hearing, who would you have? She said family and friends. I told her which family and friends were coming and then I said, ‘How about anybody else?’ She said, ‘Darth Vader.’ ” • Need a little inspiration?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Alexander married twice: Roxana, daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, out of love; and Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of Darius III of Persia, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Spirtual\\" correctly answer the question \\"What type of sexuality was Alexander speculated to have?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"spiritual\\" is not the correct answer to describe Alexander's speculated sexuality. According to the paragraph, there have been speculations and controversies about his sexuality, and it is mentioned that he may have been bisexual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Analyze the given statement \\"Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the Red Shirts, a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the Democratic Party, helped suppress black voting.\\" This statement discusses the political situation and voting suppression around the time of the abolition of slavery, specifically mentioning the Republican domination, the rise of the Red Shirts, and their connection with the Democratic Party. Step 3: Identify the information gap The statement doesn't address what slave owners did not receive when slavery was abolished. It focuses on political events and voter suppression. Step 4: Provide a correct answer A more appropriate answer to the question would be: \\"When the US abolished slavery, slave owners were not given compensation for the loss of their enslaved labor force.\\" By following these steps, we can conclude that the original statement did not correctly answer the question being asked, and a better response has been provided."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Languages of Mali. Yes or no? Answer: Of these, French is the official language and Bambara is the most widely spoken. Question: what is the language of mali Answer:","completion":"Mali is a diverse and multilingual country located in West Africa, with around 20 different languages spoken across its territories. However, there are two primary languages: French and Bambara. French is the official language of Mali, as it was a French colony until it gained independence in 1960. It is used in government, education, and formal situations. Although a significant percentage of the population doesn't speak or understand French fluently, it serves as a bridge between different ethnic communities and is the most widely recognized language. People who are educated in Mali typically learn French, as it is the medium of instruction in schools and universities. Moreover, French is used for national and international communication, official documents, and as a lingua franca among people from distinct linguistic backgrounds. Bambara, on the other hand, is an indigenous language that belongs to the Mande language family. It is the most widely spoken language in Mali, with approximately 80% of the population speaking or understanding it to some extent. Most Bambara speakers live in the southern and central parts of the country, but the language is understood across the nation and serves as a significant means of communication among various ethnic groups. It is written using both the Latin script and N'Ko script. Bambara has a strong presence in everyday life, particularly in oral traditions, music, and local markets. It is also used in informal settings and communities throughout the country. Other languages spoken in Mali include Fulani (also known as Peul or Fula), Dogon, Soninke, Songhai, Tamashek (spoken by the Tuareg people), and numerous other minority languages. These languages reflect the diverse range of ethnic groups and cultures present within the country, each with their own traditions, beliefs, and cultural expressions. Mali's multilingual nature is a testament to its rich history and cultural diversity. While French remains the official language and is used for formal communication and education, Bambara is the most widely spoken language, enabling connection among different communities. The nation's complex linguistic landscape is a testament to the country's vibrant and diverse cultural fabric, as each language offers a unique insight into the perspectives and experiences of its speakers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PUBLISHED:. 12:51 EST, 20 February 2014. |. UPDATED:. 13:58 EST, 20 February 2014. We swear far more on Twitter than in the real world, researchers have found. A major analysis of 51 million English language tweets revealed that one in 13 contains a curse. Researchers were also able to rank the most popular words, finding f**k was the most popular - and the top seven accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets. The most popular curse words on Twitter: Researchers examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. just before they go to bed, the researchers found. They also found people swore earlier in the week - Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contained the most curse words relative to tweet volume. 'It’s a sizable fraction of the words we use,' Wenbo Wang, a PhD researcher at Wright State University who led the study, told Fastco. 'On average, one tweet out of 13 tweets will contain at least one cursing word,' 'Because of social media, people don’t see each other. 'They can say things they wouldn’t say in the physical world.' The team at Wright State University examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts. They found that we curse more on Twitter than in real life, but tend to use only a few words. 'We found that the curse words occurred at the rate of 1.15% on Twitter, and 7.73% of all the tweets in our dataset contained curse words,' the team wrote in their paper, which was presented this week at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing. 'We also found that seven most frequently used curse words accounted for more than 90% of all the cursing occurrences.' The team say they wanted to find out it we cursed more on Twitter. 'Cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world: 0.5% to 0.7% of all the words we speak are curse words, given that 1% of all the words are first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us, our),' the researchers wrote. Lack of imagination: The top seven curse words accounted for 90% of all curses, the researchers found. 'On social media, people can instantly chat with friends without face-to-face interaction, usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network.' They also classified the cursing, and identified five different emotions from tweets - anger, joy, sadness, love, and thankfulness. 'Based on the classification results, we found that cursing on Twitter was. most closely associated with two negative emotions: sadness and anger. 'However, curse words could also be used to emphasize positive emotions such as joy or love.' Other insights in the paper involved timing, location, gender, and level of influence of the tweeters. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. before bedtime, and Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contain the most curse words relative to tweet volume. Researcher say the hour before we go to sleep is when we are most likely to swear in a tweet. They also found user swore less when talking directly to another user. 'Our study of the relation between cursing and message types suggests that users perform self-censorship when they talk directly to other users. 'We find that users do curse more in relaxed environments, but the differences across different environments are very small, partly due to the fact that Twitter messages are posted in virtual digital world. They also found men tended to swear more. 'Men curse more than women, men overuse some curse words different from what women use and vice versa, and both men and women are more likely to curse in the same-gender contexts.

Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go. In which way Rob would not sink, sign A or sign B? Hint: Quicksand forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it's challenging to definitively decide whether the path at sign A or sign B has quicksand. However, since sign A warns that it's quicksand, it's advisable for Rob to choose the path at sign B to minimize the risk of encountering quicksand.

Short movie review: meditative Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the term 'meditative', it implies that the critic thought of the movie in a positive light. Meditative films are known for their thoughtful, reflective, and contemplative nature. Such movies typically invite viewers to think about the deeper meanings, various themes, and complex layers hidden beneath the surface of the story. They go beyond straightforward plot narratives and approach storytelling with intricate depth, creating room for personal interpretation and introspection. Hence, a critic labeling a movie as 'meditative' likely appreciated these qualities. In a broader perspective, movies are a form of art and are designed to evoke a wide array of feelings, thoughts, and reactions. Art forms which inspire contemplation are often seen as successful in engaging viewers on a profound level. This resonance and engagement at an intellectual and emotional front make people applaud such pieces of art, considering them effective and impactful. Describing a movie as 'meditative' further suggests that the critic recognized the film's relaxing or soothing rhythm, it’s potential to delve into the psyche of characters, or highlight human behavior and social issues. Often these movies do not rely heavily on action or overt drama, but rather on character interactions, stylistic cinematic techniques, and skillful screenwriting to convey their intentions. Such features can inherently make a film more impactful and stand out for a critic trained to appreciate the art of nuanced storytelling. By choosing the term 'meditative', the critic is indicating that the movie stimulated thought, induced a sense of peace, tranquility, or introspection, and was likely well-crafted—elements that are typically associated with a positive movie review. Furthermore, it’s essential to keep in mind that the critic's positive view does not necessarily dictate the general perception of the movie. Different people may have different reactions to the same movie, depending on individual taste and personal interpretation. Nevertheless, a 'meditative' appraisal implies that there were elements within the movie that provoked careful thought and consideration, and this typically points towards creative success and a positive review from the critic's perspective. Therefore, we can conclude that the critic thought positively of the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church . - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster.

The time I spent with this book was a complete waste.","completion":"Considering the specific review provided, the likelihood of me buying the product would decrease. This response is based on a thorough evaluation of the review title and its content. Below is a detailed breakdown of the analysis: 1. Review title: \\"Does not live up to the hype!\\" The title suggests that the product might have received some positive attention or been advertised with high promises. However, according to the reviewer, it fails to deliver on those expectations. The negative sentiment in the title signifies dissatisfaction, thus decreasing the chances of considering the product. 2. Dissatisfaction with the selection of monologues: The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the content of the product they purchased (in this case, a book with a selection of monologues). This implies that the book may not provide what it claims or that the content does not meet the standards of the reviewer. In turn, this detracts from the product's appeal, further lowering the probability of a purchase. 3. Unproductive organization: The review states that the organization of the book is \\"extremely unproductive.\\" A disorganized and poorly structured book poses difficulty in navigation, comprehension, and searchability. This issue is another significant factor contributing to the negative assessment of the product, further decreasing the chances of purchasing it. 4. Time wasted: The reviewer says that the time spent with the book was a \\"complete waste.\\" This statement emphasizes that they did not derive any value from the product and that the investment of time had no favorable outcome. This sentiment is another compelling reason to avoid the product, as consumers generally seek products that offer tangible benefits, usability, or satisfaction. Based on the negative tone and specific drawbacks highlighted in the review, the chances of buying the product are diminished. The reviewer's dissatisfaction, criticism of content selection, disorganization of the book, and the wasted time invested in using the product are all factors that contribute to this decision. Since consumers typically rely on reviews to gain insights and learn from others' experiences, a review like this can significantly influence the decision-making process and decrease the likelihood of purchasing the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming.Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. He is picked up by a chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette.During his investigation Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be un-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognises Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter.

Choices: - fibers - ions - seeds - spores A: Answer:","completion":"The answer is - spores. Explanation: In the life cycle of a plant, sporophyte is the stage in which the plant is diploid, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes. Meiosis is the process by which these diploid cells (sporophyte) divide to produce haploid cells with just one set of chromosomes. These haploid cells are called spores. They further develop into the gametophyte stage of the plant, which can produce gametes for sexual reproduction. The other options - fibers, ions, and seeds - are not the products of meiosis in the sporophyte stage. This cycle, known as alternation of generations, is the typical reproduction cycle in many plants and some algae. The diploid stage (sporophyte) and haploid stage (gametophyte) alternate, ensuring genetic variation and continuity of species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: HANOI, Vietnam — Opening a new source of potential friction with China, the Obama administration said Friday that it would step into a tangled dispute between China and its smaller Asian neighbors over a string of strategically sensitive islands in the South China Sea. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking at an Asian regional security meeting in Vietnam, said, “The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia’s maritime commons, and respect for international law in the South China Sea.” The United States, she said, was prepared to facilitate multilateral negotiations over how to deal with the islands — something sought by Vietnam, which has had deadly clashes with China over some of them. In 1974, China seized full control of one group of islands, the Paracels, after the two sides fought. In 1988, Chinese and Vietnamese warships traded fire in another, the Spratly Islands, sinking several Vietnamese ships. Mrs. Clinton stressed that the United States was not changing its longstanding neutrality on the competing territorial claims. But China has been adamant that the disputes be resolved through one-on-one negotiations, and the administration’s decision to get involved angered China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. The United States appeared to catch China uncharacteristically flat-footed, lining up expressions of support. Twelve of the 27 countries at the meeting spoke out in favor of a new approach to the South China Sea, prompting Mr. Yang of China to observe that the American effort seemed orchestrated. International concern has been deepening about China’s maritime ambitions, which have expanded with its economic and military muscle. China is particularly covetous of the South China Sea islands — many of them just rocks or spits of sand — because they are rich in oil and natural gas deposits and because they lie so near. In recent months, administration officials said, China has harassed fishing boats and leaned on energy companies who try to make off-shore deals with other countries. It also put the United States on notice that it does not welcome foreign interference, saying it views the South China Sea as a “core interest.” China has particularly bristled over joint American-South Korean naval exercises starting this weekend off the Korean peninsula because some drills are to take place in the Yellow Sea, which China it claims as a military operation zone. Other tensions flared on the familiar front of North Korea, with an official threatening a “physical response” to the joint naval exercises. The United States intends the drills to be a deterrent to North Korean aggression, announcing them after an investigation led by South Korea found the North responsible for torpedoing a South Korean Navy ship, the Cheonan, in March. “This is not defensive training,” said the official, Ri Tong-il, noting that the United States was deploying one of its most formidable nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the George Washington, in the exercises. “It is a grave threat to the Korean peninsula and also to the region of Asia as a whole.” While the harsh words between North Korea and the United States predictably dominated this meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Mrs. Clinton’s comments about the South China Sea shone a spotlight on a less visible source of conflict in the region. For decades, China has sparred with Southeast Asian nations over control of the South China Sea islands. Earlier this year, it raised tensions with Vietnam by announcing plans to develop tourism in the Paracels. Vietnam’s strategy has been to “internationalize” the territorial disputes with China by bringing in other players for multilateral negotiations to dilute China’s power. Mrs. Clinton’s announcement that the United States would be willing to play a part was a significant victory for the Vietnamese. But it could further irritate Washington’s relations with Beijing. Last March, the Chinese government told two visiting senior Obama administration officials, Jeffrey A. Bader and James B. Steinberg, that it would not tolerate any interference in the South China Sea, an official said. The Unites States tried, with somewhat less success, to marshal support for South Korea in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan. While many countries expressed condolences for the attack, which killed 46 sailors, few were willing to point a finger at North Korea as the culprit. But North Korea has opened a small window of engagemetn on the issue. Military officers from North Korea and the United Nations Command met on the inter-Korean border on Friday for the second time this month to discuss the sinking. Meeting at the border village of Panmunjom, colonels from both sides “exchanged ideas and further details for convening a joint assessment group” to investigate “the cause of the armistice violations that led to the sinking,” the American-led United Nations Command said. It remained unclear whether North Korea accepted the proposal. North Korea has so far insisted that it conduct its own investigation by sending a team of “inspectors” to South Korea. On Friday, the United Nations Command notified North Korea of plans to hold another joint America and South Korean military exercise: an annual drill from Aug. 16 to Aug. 26. The United States military traditionally does not announce the location of the drill. Mrs. Clinton struck a bleak tone about any easing of tensions with North Korea. She said the United States was still open to talks with Pyongyang if it agreed to give up its nuclear weapons, but concluded, “Under the current circumstances, it appears unlikely that we will be able to make any progress in the near term.” Her stop in Hanoi wrapped up a grueling trip that amounted to a tour of American wars, past and present: from Afghanistan to the demilitarized zone in South Korea, and finally to Vietnam, where, in a sunset ceremony, she watched the remains of three American soldiers killed in the war loaded on an Air Force transport plane to be retuned to the United States. Mrs. Clinton sought to apply lessons from the American experience in the Korean War to Afghanistan. “We saw South Korea struggle to become a functioning democracy — huge amounts of instability, coups, corruption, scandal, you name it,” she said. It’s good to remind ourselves: the United States has stood with countries that went through a lot of ups and downs for a lot longer than eight years.” Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Ed Wong from Beijing.

However, you should follow standards you are most comfortable with to protect the health of your dog. Many kennel clubs require a dog to be 8 years or younger to register litters. Many vets suggest that dogs of normal health should be retired from breeding around 8 years old. The strictest standard to retire a dog from breeding is 5 years of age. Consult your vet when considering breeding a dog older than 5 years old. The age of your dog needs to be evaluated with other factors including size and breed. Certain breeds of dogs should be retired from breeding earlier than others. This is because some breeds have physiological issues and other related problems that could cause complications with pregnancy. Chihuahuas and other toy dogs should be retired from breeding around 5 years old. Large breed dogs like standard poodles should be retired from breeding around 5 or 6 years old. Medium sized dogs may be bred longer than small or large breed dogs, depending on specific medical conditions and the opinion of your veterinarian. Many responsible breeders, vets, and kennel clubs suggest that people stop breeding dogs after a certain number of pregnancies. Consider: Some kennel clubs will stop registering litters after a dog has whelped 4 or 6 litters. Many veterinarians advise to retire a dog from breeding after 4 litters. The higher number of pregnancies, the lower the genetic diversity within a certain breed. Many irresponsible breeders, known as puppy mills, produce large numbers of dogs regardless of the health and well-being of the dogs themselves.","completion":"People have different opinions about when dogs should stop having babies, but it's important to keep the dog healthy and follow rules set by dog clubs and vets, and it can depend on the dog's size and breed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about Old English.","completion":"What major factors contributed to the development and evolution of the Old English language? Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was a language spoken from approximately 450 AD to 1100 AD in what is now England and southern Scotland. As a Germanic language, it emerged from the linguistic influences of several tribes and significant historical events. The development and evolution of Old English language can be analyzed from various angles. In this answer, we will investigate five significant factors that contributed to its development: the arrival of Anglo-Saxons, Latin influence, Viking invasions, literary works, and regional dialects. 1. Arrival of Anglo-Saxons: The most important factor in the emergence of Old English can be traced back to the migration of three major Germanic tribes: the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes. These tribes arrived in Britain in the 5th century AD, following the withdrawal of the Roman Empire. As these tribes settled in Britain, they brought their own Germanic languages (Old Saxons and Old Jtivs, for example) and dialects, which started to mingle with the native Celtic languages. Over time, these languages evolved into a single, unified language known as Old English. 2. Latin influence: Even before the mass migration of Anglo-Saxons, Britain had been part of the Roman Empire since the 1st century AD, which introduced Latin into the region. While Latin did not become the dominant language of the native Celtic-speaking Britons, it still left its mark on Old English. The Latin impact on Old English included borrowed words, especially in areas of religion, education, and administration. As Christianity became more established in Britain around the 7th century, this Latin influence increased significantly because Latin was the language of the Church. 3. Viking invasions: Beginning in the late 8th century, Nordic invaders, primarily the Danes, began raiding Britain. They eventually settled in a specific region known as Danelaw in the north and east sections of England. The Vikings spoke Old Norse, which was another North Germanic language. Due to prolonged contact between the Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons and the Old Norse-speaking Vikings, the two languages began to influence one another. This linguistic exchange resulted in the incorporation of Old Norse vocabulary, grammatical structures, and various linguistic features into Old English. 4. Literary works: Old English literature played an essential role in preserving and codifying the language. Notable Old English works, such as the epic poem \\"Beowulf,\\" \\"Caedmon's Hymn,\\" and various law texts, religious manuscripts and historical chronicles, all contributed to the development and documentation of the language. Literature also played a part in preserving regional dialects, producing a more distinct picture of how Old English varied across different regions. 5. Regional dialects: Old English was comprised of different regional dialects, mainly West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian, and Kentish. Each of these dialects has unique features, such as phonetic, grammatical, and vocabulary differences. These variations were, in part, due to the geographical spread of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes across Britain and their interactions with native Celtic speakers and Viking invaders. West Saxon, in particular, became the dominant dialect during the reign of King Alfred the Great in the late 9th century and was the foundation for many literary works during this time, further influencing the development of Old English. In conclusion, the development of Old English language was a complex process that evolved over centuries from the early interaction between Celtic, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon linguistic influences to the intense contact with Old Norse speakers and the preservation of regional dialects. Each factor significantly shaped Old English's evolution and shaped the linguistic foundation that would eventually transition into Middle English after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

Which farmer didn't have soil development operate in relative drought on his parcel? Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Bob, the farmer with the old growth forest parcel, did not have soil development operate in relative drought on his parcel. This is because the paragraph states that the soil development operating in relative drought, along with the mentioned processes, occurs in grasslands.

Solve -19819 = 398*h - 15839 for h. Solve this problem.","completion":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this equation step by step. We want to figure out what 'h' is. We have this equation: -19819 = 398*h - 15839 First, we need to move the -15839 from the right side of the equation to the left side to help us solve for 'h'. To do this, we need to add 15839 to both sides: -19819 + 15839 = 398*h - 15839 + 15839 When we do this, we get: -3980 = 398*h Now, we need to find the value of 'h'. Since 398 is multiplied by 'h', we should do the opposite of multiplication to find 'h'. So, we need to divide both sides by 398: -3980 ÷ 398 = (398*h) ÷ 398 When we do this, we find that: -10 = h So there you have it, the value of 'h' is -10.

Can you tell me the answer to who did the voice of king louie in the original jungle book??","completion":"King Louie, the eccentric, fun-loving orangutan in Disney's original 1967 animated film \\"The Jungle Book,\\" was voiced by the talented singer, actor, and jazz musician Louis Prima. Born on December 7, 1910, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Louis Prima experienced considerable success in his career, spanning five decades. He was a well-known singer, trumpet player, and bandleader during the Swing Era, Big Band Era, and beyond. Born into a musical family, Prima was initially trained in the violin. However, he eventually discovered his passion for jazz and switched to the trumpet. By the age of 17, he started playing jazz professionally. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Prima made a name for himself in the music and entertainment industry. He had a unique performing style and a natural, charismatic stage presence. The Jungle Book, based on Rudyard Kipling's stories, follows the life and adventures of Mowgli, a human boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. In the film, King Louie is a comical character who rules over a kingdom of apes and desires to learn the secret of \\"man's red fire.\\" When Disney's songwriting team, Richard and Robert Sherman, were tasked with creating music for the film, they decided that King Louie required a jazz-based musical number. They thus specifically approached Louis Prima to lend his voice and style to the character. Prima gladly accepted the offer, and the Sherman Brothers crafted the delightful and catchy \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" song, which has become a quintessential element of King Louie's identity. Louis Prima's swing/jazz style and engaging voice turned King Louie into a truly memorable character. He infused the character with a playful, energetic, and lively demeanor that has essentially defined King Louie in the minds of audiences worldwide. Prima's performance as King Louie remains an iconic example of voice acting in the animated film industry, and the character continues to be cherished by generations of fans."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The air exploded in a flash of bone and steel and blood. The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. For most of the Gaelic period, dwellings and farm buildings were circular with conical thatched roofs (see roundhouse). Square and rectangle-shaped buildings gradually became more common, and by the 14th or 15th century they had replaced round buildings completely. In some areas, buildings were made mostly of stone. In others, they were built of timber, wattle and daub, or a mix of materials. Most ancient and early medieval stone buildings were of dry stone construction. Some buildings would have had glass windows. Among the wealthy, it was common for women to have their own 'apartment' called a grianan (anglicized \\"greenan\\") in the sunniest part of the homestead. The dwellings of freemen and their families were often surrounded by a circular rampart called a \\"ringfort\\". There are two main kinds of ringfort. The rath is an earthen ringfort, averaging 30m diameter, with a dry outside ditch. The cathair or caiseal is a stone ringfort. The ringfort would typically have enclosed the family home, small farm buildings or workshops, and animal pens. Most date to the period 500-1000 CE and there is evidence of large-scale ringfort desertion at the end of the first millennium. The remains of between 30,000 and 40,000 lasted into the 19th century to be mapped by Ordnance Survey Ireland. Another kind of native dwelling was the crannog, which were roundhouses built on artificial islands in lakes. There were very few nucleated settlements in Gaelic areas. However, after the 5th century some monasteries became the heart of small \\"monastic towns\\". By the 10th century the Norse-Gaelic ports of Dublin, Wexford, Cork and Limerick had grown into substantial settlements. It was at this time, perhaps as a response to Viking raids, that many of the Irish round towers were built. In the fifty years before the Norman invasion, the term \\"castle\\" (Old Irish: caistel/caislen) appears in Gaelic writings, although there are no surviving examples of pre-Norman castles. After the invasion, the Normans built motte-and-bailey castles in the areas they occupied, some of which were converted from ringforts. By 1300 \\"some mottes, especially in frontier areas, had almost certainly been built by the Gaelic Irish in imitation\\". The Normans gradually replaced wooden motte-and-baileys with stone castles and tower houses. Tower houses are free-standing multi-storey stone towers usually surrounded by a wall (see bawn) and ancillary buildings. Gaelic families had begun to build their own tower houses by the 15th century. As many as 7000 may have been built, but they were rare in areas with little Norman settlement or contact. They are concentrated in counties Limerick and Clare but are lacking in Ulster, except the area around Strangford Lough. In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' called a maighin digona surrounded each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied according to the owner's rank. In the case of a boaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring that person to justice by lawful means. Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items. Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism. Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen. Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman. Many moorland areas were \\"shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony\\". Gaelic Ireland was well furnished with roads and bridges. Bridges were typically wooden and in some places the roads were laid with wood and stone. There were five main roads leading from Tara: Slighe Asail, Slighe Chualann, Slighe Dala, Slighe Mor and Slighe Midluachra. Horses were one of the main means of long-distance transport. Although horseshoes and reins were used, the Gaelic Irish did not use saddles, stirrups or spurs. Every man was trained to spring from the ground on to the back of his horse (an ech-leim or \\"steed-leap\\") and they urged-on and guided their horses with a rod having a hooked goad at the end. Two-wheeled and four-wheeled chariots (singular carbad) were used in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war. They were big enough for two people, made of wickerwork and wood, and often had decorated hoods. The wheels were spoked, shod all round with iron, and were from three to four and a half feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature. Boats used in Gaelic Ireland include canoes, currachs, sailboats and Irish galleys. Ferryboats were used to cross wide rivers and are often mentioned in the Brehon Laws as subject to strict regulations. Sometimes they were owned by individuals and sometimes they were the common property of those living round the ferry. Large boats were used for trade with mainland Europe.

Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O' Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in. Man about the house was a pre-cursor to Cooke and Mortimer's spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred (the late and much missed Yootha Joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it). The American's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script.

The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

Noticing the man's determination to divorce his wife, Gavin decides to tell him the story of one of his clients, a personal friend of his. Oliver Rose, a student at Harvard Law School, meets Barbara at an auction, where they bid on the same antique. Oliver chats Barbara up and they become friends. When Barbara misses her ferry home, the two end up spending the night together at a local hotel. Eventually the two marry and have two children, Josh and Carolyn. Over the years, the Roses grow richer, and Barbara finds an old mansion whose owner has recently died, purchases it and devotes her time to making a home there. However, cracks seem to be forming in the family. As Oliver becomes a successful partner in his law firm, Barbara, who was a doting and loving wife early in the marriage, appears to grow restless in her life with Oliver, and begins to dislike him immensely. Oliver, for his part, cannot understand what he has done to earn Barbara's contempt, despite his controlling, self-centered, and generally dismissive behavior toward her. When Oliver believes he is suffering a heart attack, (actually a hiatal hernia) the day after an argument, Barbara (after her initial shock and concern) realizes she felt a sense of relief that he might be dead. She tells him so, adding that she no longer loves him and wants a divorce and Oliver accepts. Feeling that it might not be wise to represent himself, Oliver hires Gavin as his legal counsel on a retainer. Tension arises between Oliver and Barbara during negotiations when it becomes clear that she wants the house and everything in it. When Barbara's lawyer uses Oliver's final love note to her (which he had written in the hospital) as leverage against him in their legal battle, she refuses to back down.

Question: The man loved to fish bass, to be happy all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a what? Options: A. river B. freshwater lake C. sunshine D. music store E. live in ponds Answer:","completion":"B. Freshwater Lake The man loved to fish for bass, and to be happy, all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a freshwater lake. This is the option that aligns most closely with common sense in this context for the following reasons: 1. Freshwater lakes are known to be a natural habitat for various species of bass. Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are commonly found in freshwater lakes and reservoirs, which makes this the perfect setting for the man to go fishing. In contrast, options A (river) and E (live in ponds) also contain bass, but they are less commonly associated with bass fishing than a lake environment. 2. Sunshine (C) is a vital factor for a great fishing experience, but it is not directly related to the fishing activity itself. Having a sunny day might make the man happier and provide better fishing conditions, but it is not essential for bass fishing, and is not specifically associated with the pursuit and capture of bass. 3. A music store (D) is not pertinent to the man's interest in fishing. It is unrelated to the context and does not contribute to his enjoyment of bass fishing. Although music could be a source of enjoyment, it does not provide him with the bass fishing experience he desires. In conclusion, choosing option B, the freshwater lake, is the most consistent with common sense, given the man's love for fishing bass and the need for a suitable environment for pursuing his passion. The freshwater lake would provide him with access to the bass species and the best opportunity to stay happy and indulge in his favorite pastime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think in reds and blacks. Move clusters of the same color. Know that the rest of the rules apply.","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Spider Solitaire: Delving into the Strategy of the Two-Suit Variation Introduction Spider Solitaire is a popular and challenging card game that requires patience, strategy, and a keen eye for detail. The game comes in three different variations, distinguishing themselves by the number of suits they feature: one-suit (easy), two-suit (intermediate), and four-suit (expert). This article will provide an in-depth dive into the two-suit variation of Spider Solitaire, examining its rules, strategies, and helpful tips on how to play the game effectively. Setting Up the Game First, let's start by dealing out the cards. In this two-suit version, we will be working only with red cards (hearts and diamonds) and black cards (spades and clubs). Shuffle two decks of standard playing cards together, excluding jokers. Lay out ten piles of five cards each, flip the top card face-up in each pile, and place the remaining cards in the draw pile. Moving Clusters of the Same Color Now that the game is set up, the objective is to move cards between piles in descending order, beginning with the king and ending with the ace. However, in this two-suit version, you must focus on creating sequences by paying attention to both the rank and the color (red or black) of the cards. This means players can only move cards onto others of the same color (for example, a red eight can only be placed on a red nine). To optimize your play, look for clusters of the same color. A cluster is a group of cards of the same color in descending order. Moving clusters of the same color will allow you to more easily empty columns, which, in turn, gives you more space to play with and increases your chances of winning. Apply General Spider Solitaire Rules Aside from these specific recommendations, players should remember that standard Spider Solitaire rules apply to the two-suit version: 1. Empty Columns: If a column is emptied, any card or a cluster of the same color can be placed in that column. 2. Dealing New Cards: If you run out of moves, you can deal new cards from the draw pile on top of each column with at least one card. Make sure that all initial face-down cards have been turned face-up before doing this. 3. Building Complete Sequences: The ultimate goal of the game is to create complete sequences of the same suit. In this variation, the sequence must be from King to Ace of either hearts or diamonds for red sequences, and from King to Ace of either spades or clubs for black sequences. 4. Removing Completed Sequences: As you complete strategies, remove them from play by transferring them to a separate area. The game is won when all cards have been sorted into their appropriate sequences and removed from play. Helpful Tips for Winning Two-Suit Spider Solitaire 1. Prioritize unearthing face-down cards: Exposing and utilizing face-down cards should be your primary focus. This not only gives you more options for creating sequences but also uncovers any hidden potential clusters. 2. Be cautious about building on higher cards: While it’s necessary to make progress, building on higher-ranked cards can be risky, as it may limit your moves in the long run. Aim to uncover and use lower-ranked cards as much as possible. 3. Keep track of suits: As you progress through the two-suit version, remember that even though we think in reds and blacks, you must ultimately form sequences of the same suit (hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs). Knowing which cards belong to each suit can help with planning and increases chances of success. Conclusion The two-suit variation of Spider Solitaire raises the difficulty level by adding more dimensions to the game. By focusing on reds and blacks, moving clusters of the same color, and understanding how to apply the general rules effectively, players set themselves up for success. With practice, patience, and strategic thinking, players will improve their skill and enjoy the gratifying challenge of mastering the two-suit Spider Solitaire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It is one of the most annoying words in the English language and it seems there is no escaping it. The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages.

This is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy Jamaican restaurant known as The Breadfruit. I loved the vibe of this place as soon as I walked in the door. Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here. They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself. The first one I tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really delicious, though I expected more heat. My husband wanted a Jack and diet coke but was told that they had neither (no whiskey since rums are their thing and they also don't offer soda with artificial sweeteners). However the bartender recommended he try the Tennessee Rum Cider. This drink tasted surprisingly like whiskey but actually is made with a rum called Prichard's Fine (which is made in Tennessee) mixed with an organic apple cider. The second drink that I tried was a Dark and Stormy. I had this drink at Citizen Public House and didn't really care for it but I really enjoyed this one. Now don't get me wrong, I am well aware that CPH mixes up the best cocktails on the planet. But I just happened to like this particular drink here at the Rum Bar better. One of my companions said it was because of the type of rum they use (Goslings). The cocktails were all 8 or 9 and their wines were 10 a glass (but they had Dos Cabezas, yay!) so because of that this would never be someplace I would come drink on a regular basis. Though I certainly don't mind splurging on a premium cocktail every once in a while. I saw they also had a cigar patio so I think this would be the perfect place for a classy bachelor party or b-day.","completion":"Step 1: Read the review carefully.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article:It reminds me of reporting on a drought a few years ago: while filming interviews with people about the impact, the heavens opened and rainwater was soon flowing down my neck. So as journalists were invited to the Science Media Centre in London to hear how the worldwide rise in temperatures has stalled, the mercury shot up as if on cue to record the hottest day of the year so far. In many ways, this event was long overdue: climate sceptics have for years pointed out that the world is not warming as rapidly as once forecast. A lot depends on how you do the measurements, of course. Each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. But start your graph in 1998 - which happened to be an exceptionally warm year - and there hasn't been much global warming at all. Gradually the words 'pause' and 'hiatus' which first featured in the blogs have crossed to the media and then to the scientists professionally engaged in researching the global climate. The headline - which the scientists will not thank me for - is that no one is really sure why the rate of warming has stumbled. There are plenty of possible explanations but none of them adds up to a definitive smoking gun. Professor Piers Forster of Leeds University has tried to quantify the different factors involved - what's known as their \\"radiative forcing\\". Between 1998-2012, he reckons, manmade greenhouse gases were still the biggest influence, causing warming of 0.48 of a Watt per square metre (a key measure of energy flows to and from the planet). At the same, he estimates, two other natural influences might have led to some cooling: a relatively quiet Sun might have been responsible for a reduction of 0.16 of a Watt/sq m and volcanic eruptions another 0.06 Watt/sq m. A big unknown is the effect of aerosols - tiny particles released by industrial pollution which could cause a further cooling effect. It is thought that the world's massive industrialisation after World War Two contributed to a slight drop in global temperatures in the late 1940s. But the key factor - according to all the speakers at the briefing - is that whatever solar energy is making it through to the surface, much is being absorbed by the hidden depths of the oceans. The Argo network of automated monitors has been deployed since 2005 to measure the waters as deep as 1,800m. This isn't a very long period but the data are apparently showing some warming - even in this short time frame. And readings from satellites since 2000 show how much energy is arriving at the planet, and how much is leaving, so if the energy left behind is not manifesting itself in rising surface temperatures, then it must be going somewhere - and the deep ocean is the most plausible explanation. On top of that, the scientists say, pauses in warming were always to be expected. This is new - at least to me. It is common sense that climate change would not happen in a neat, linear away but instead in fits and starts. But I've never heard leading researchers mention the possibility before. Professor Rowan Sutton, of Reading University, said computer simulations or models of possible future climate scenarios often show periods of ten years with no warming trend - some even show pauses of 20-25 years. And Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said observations and models showed that on average there were - or would be - two pauses in warming every century. I asked why this had not come up in earlier presentations. No one really had an answer, except to say that this \\"message\\" about pauses had not been communicated widely. So where does this leave us, as greenhouse gases emissions keep rising but the temperature does not? Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office, pointed out that 12 of the 14 warmest years have occurred since the year 2000 and says that other indicators - like the decline in Arctic sea ice of 12.9% per decade and losses of snow cover and glaciers - still point to a process of manmade warming. But what about another possibility - that the calculations are wrong? What if the climate models - which are the very basis for all discussions of what to do about global warming - exaggerate the sensitivity of the climate to rising carbon dioxide? Dr Stott conceded that the projections showing the most rapid warming now look less likely, given recent observations, but that others remain largely unchanged. A Met Office briefing document, released at the briefing, says that, even allowing for the temperatures of the last decade, the most likely warming scenario is only reduced by 10% - so \\"the warming that we might have expected by 2050 would be delayed by only a few years\\". Overall, it concludes, the pause \\"does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century.\\" In other words, global warming is still on. But until the pause can be properly explained, many people will take a lot of convincing - especially if the pause lasts longer than expected. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses the worldwide stall in the rise of temperatures, which has led to a pause or hiatus in global warming. Despite this stall, each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. The cause of this rate stagnation in warming is unknown, with numerous possible explanations but no definitive answer. Factors that could contribute to the pause include manmade greenhouse gases, natural influences such as a dormant sun, volcanic eruptions, and the effect of aerosols. The article highlights the significant role of oceans in absorbing solar energy, resulting in hidden depths of warming. Additionally, the article mentions that pauses in warming were always expected, not happening in a perfectly linear manner but rather in fits and starts. Computer simulations often show periods of 10 to 25 years with no warming trend. Even as temperatures stall, other indicators such as the decline of Arctic sea ice, losses of snow cover, and glaciers point to a process of manmade warming.

In just the past year, Smith has lost 100 pounds. \\"Running the Marine Corps [Marathon] in D.C., demonstrates to people that if a50-year-old man that one year ago weighed 325 pounds can change his health, andreverse his Diabetes 2 symptoms, that they can do it too,\\" says Smith. \\"I've hadmany people say to me young and old that I've inspired them.\\" Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Good morning. Very exciting start to the 35th Marine Corps Marathon Weekend earlier this morning when the Health and Fitness Expo opened at the Washington Convention Center. Lots of activities and events around \\"The People's Marathon\\" and Art and I are happy to answer questions to make everyone's experience even better. McLean, Va.: So what should we be wearing on Sunday? By 8 a.m., will it be warm enough for shorts and short sleeves? I remember all of the gloves tossed on the ground last year. On the course, are there places (like the water stations) where it's okay to drop a layer of clothing? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Runners should dress for cold dark early morning arrival at MCM. Sunrise is usually around 7:10 a.m. We will have UPS trucks in Runners Village for runners to check their bags and then pick up at finish. Recommend if cold, stay in clothing as long as you deem necessary. Some shed at the start...others in Runners Village at the trucks. Arlington, Va.: Can you elaborate on the tracking of runners during the race? This year there are no text message; rather, an iPhone/Android app. No one I know that is running can explain to me how exactly it will work. Do you still collect position information at each mile via shoe tags, or do you have to carry the phone during the marathon to use its GPS function? The latter seems onerous; however, the Web site says the new system uses GPS and you need a device to get \\"full functionality.\\" I expect this to be a major friction point on Sunday, so can you clarify the situation? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: The MCM collects split time data every 5k and will be live on the website. The timing device is on the reverse side of the bib. THe iPhone app is a GPS tracking program to locate runner and spectator. Both parties require the app and phone. Harrisburg, Pa.: Are you familiar with the diet being mentioned by Don Imus that suggests that a diet free of sugar may be good. What are your thoughts on a totally sugar free diet? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Iam not familiar with his diet, but for me personally I now longer eat any refined white sugar, even brown sugar. I do LOVE sweets, so Ive discovered agave made from the agave cactus. Good luck with your diet! XOART Tallahassee, Fla.: We're rooting for you Art. Congratulations. Marc Goldman and Art Smith: I LOVE TALLY! XOOXOXART Harrisburg, Pa.: As Oprah's chef, what have you observed during her battles with weight loss and weight gain, and would do you recommend someone do nutritionally who (like most of us) face these battles all the time? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: As a personal chef to many of our country and world celebrities, just like us they deal with diet and weight issues. Trust me when everybody knows you they all want to feed you! I have won the battle by portion control and consistent excercise. Keep people around you that show you love and appreciation. XOART Philadelphia, Pa.: When did you first run a 26-mile marathon, and how long did it take once you began running to be able to run such a marathon? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: I ran my first marathon 3 weeks ago, 4.32 45 seconds. Ive been doing small runs and some long ones. Personally, i believe I was born to run, so its easy for me. Iam excited about Sundady, but every race is different. Ive heard there are some BIG BIG HILLS! XOART Washington, D.C.: Sorry, I'm a newbie. What is split-time data? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: this is your timing results from the 5k marks along the course. Rosslyn, Va.: If I'm not checking a bag and am coming from Rosslyn, can I just walk to the starting line, or do I still have to Metro to Pentagon station? I'd prefer to walk as a warm-up but want to make sure it's okay to enter the corrals from that side. Marc Goldman and Art Smith: You can walk from Rosslyn to the start. Just about a mile away.

Ive been doing a lot of traveling around the world, and with my new health journey Ive ran in some of the most amazing cities in the world, Shanghai, South Africa, Toronto etc. Reston, Va.: I have a question for Art about weigh loss. Art, do you have any advice for people who are struggling with loosing weight and keeping it off? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Every morning I have oatmeal, egg whites and fruit, it re- establishes my daily health routine. Eating a healthy simple breakfast keeps me on task. Drink lots of water, because most people are not hungry but dehydrated. Washington, D.C.: Chef Art, what is your favorite music to listen to while running or working out? What kind of tunes get you motivated? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Lady Gaga! I love and adore her music. I lost a majority of my weight listening to Bad Romance. Ok, but Iam a child of Modonna! Music sure makes the running go by faster! Sunday Washington, D.C.: Chef Art - Are you trying to beat Oprah's time? What was her marathon time? We have an office pool going on. Just kidding. I wish you the very best on Sunday and always. Marc Goldman and Art Smith: You know don't think it hasnt crossed my mind! LOL My beloved Oprah was 40 years of age when you ran the marathon at 4.29. Iam 50 and going to have to really hoof it! Looking at doing better than my 4.32 in the Chicago Marathon. Thank you for your confidence! XOART Washington, D.C.: Did you just run another marathon recently? If so, what was the biggest obstacle you facedduring that race? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Just ran the Chicago Marathon, and ran it in 4.32. The biggest obstacle was just finishing the race! Those last 2 miles seem like 20 miles. Thanks to the crowds the great bands etc. I finished! Keeping a great pace is the secret to finishing and not \\"hot dogging it\\"! Washington, D.C.: Art, what is your favorite run in D.C.? When you are here in D.C., what your favorite route to run/jog? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: My favorite run in DC is running from Art and Soul Restaurant, my restaurant on the hill to the Lincoln Memorial and back. What a gorgeous beautiful strip of land and love dodging the tourists! XOART Fairfax, Va.: Are you doing a load-the-carb dinner Saturday night? What creation will you make? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: My favorite is multi grain pasta with a simple tomato sauce and a HUGE SALAD. We also have some great farro with grilled salmon too. XOART Brookeville, Md.: Art, what do you eat the night before, morning of, and day after a marathon? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: I eat some great multi grain pasta and simple clean sauce the night before with some grilled fish. The morning of very early, I have oatmeal, egg whites, fruit and lots of water. After, I have a BIG BIG PARTY! Going to eat a big plate of fried chicken after the race. XOXOART Are you running on a daily basis to prepare for the marathon? How many miles per day? Do you give yourself days off? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: I ran at least 3-8 miles a day and some days I bike. Also, give myself 1 day off a week. Today Iam running 3 miles down the mall and back from Art and Soul, it helps to have a running partner. XOART Washington, D.C.: What is currently on your iPod when you're training? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: LADY GAGA, MODONNA, BLACK EYE PEAS, CHRISTINA AUGILERA!!! College Park, Md.: From observing my friends who are runners, I have noticed that they all have specific training schedules before a half or full marathon (i.e., run XX miles this Saturday, XX miles next Saturday). Art, how did you plan out your training schedule? And how did you find time in your busy schedule for it? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: My health guru Az Ferguson, Game On Diet, set-up my running schedule. YOu can find Az on Facebook. He's the best! Having someone that is part of process, from coach to a great friend, really helps. One of my new friends a fan, gave me an IPOD programmed with music, that really inspired me. Schedules are tough and with my mine???You just have to do whats best for you. XOART Washington, D.C.: Chef Art - Have you thought about a victory dance for when you cross the finish line? Something Lady Gaga/Madonna-inspired. Marc Goldman and Art Smith: GREAT IDEA! Ok, Iam going to call the Oprah Show and get some advice! Thank you, my last race I just collasped next to my health guru Az Ferguson. XOART New York, N.Y.: This is for Chef Art. Training for a marathon takes extreme dedication. How do you keep yourself disciplined? If you're feeling tired, how do you motivate yourself to keep going? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: I feel and look great! People tell me and that motivates me too! XOART D.C.: What time should runners get into their corrals? I like to do a little job about 15 minutes before racing, but wonder if that's possible in such a big race. Also, with the recent course modification, is this year's MCM still certified as a full 26.2 miles? Thanks! Marc Goldman and Art Smith: We recommend moving up to ROute 110 around 7 a.m. JOgging space is availble in Pentagon Parking Lot. Course change is just a step onto the curb instead of on the street. Fairfax, Va.: How many people do you predict will be running? How many spectators? What's the route? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: 22000 in the MCM. About 10000 in the 10 K. Appox. 100,000 spectators. A party on the sidewalks and the streets. Alexandria, Va.: Are spectators allowed to make hand-offs to runners at any accessible place on the course? My husband is planning on giving me a hand-off of gel packs on M Street and later along Madison Ave. I haven't heard official word, but I was hoping this is allowed. Marc Goldman and Art Smith: If you are the lead runner, I wouldn't recommend it. Wow, 100 pounds?: I just saw a recent photo and good for you! I've enjoyed seeing on Top Chef episodes. Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Yes one year and a 100 pounds! Iam feeling very good! All those fears I had about being to old and it being hard for a person who is older to loose weight????Well, its not true! Clean, whole food, and moderate excercise will set you free. Thank you for watching Top Chef Masters! XOART Brookeville, Md.: Is there anything in particular you drink to stay hydrated during your run (sports drinks, etc)? Or just water? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: To be honest I hate the taste of them and I rather drink water. My favorite is a double espresso before the race and water. XOART Upper Marlboro, Md.: Art, I wish I had that feeling: \\"born to run.\\" I really struggle after about 15 miles. What can I do to help me get through? By the way Table 51 is awesome!! I met you at the restuarant in 2007; the grueling hot weekend of the Chicago Marathon Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Thank you! Iams so happy that you loved Table 52, its my baby! We all struggle after 15 miles, you just practice and take care of yourself. My favorite is to have a double espresso before I run and it keeps me very perky all the way through. Yes, it was really really hot in Chicago, but thanks to my health coach Az Ferguson I made it through. College Park, Md.: What is your most memorable 'eye of the tiger' moment in all of your training? Marc Goldman and Art Smith: Seeing the finish line at The Chicago Marathon!

The series was the first animated production by Walt Disney Animation Television, and loosely inspired by the gummy bear candies; Disney CEO Michael Eisner was struck with inspiration for the show when his son requested the candies one day. The series premiered on NBC on September 14, 1985, and aired there for four seasons. The series moved to ABC for one season from 1989 to 1990 (airing alongside \\"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\\" as the \\"Gummi Bears-Winnie the Pooh Hour\\"), and concluded on September 6, 1991 as part of the Disney Afternoon television syndication package. Of the series' 65 shows, 30 were double-features, consisting of two 11-minute cartoons, thereby bringing the series total to 94 distinct episodes overall. The show is well-remembered for its theme music, written by Michael and Patty Silversher and creation of \\"gummiberry juice\\" which was a type of magic potion, gaining abilities, which allowed them to bounce away from their hunters. - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center). - Gerald David \\"Lorenzo\\" Music (May 2, 1937 August 4, 2001) was an American actor, voice actor, writer, producer, and musician.

CLOSE Actress Allison Janney gives her thoughts on Tonya Harding at the 2018 Golden Globes. USA TODAY Tonya Harding arrives at the 75th annual Golden Globe Awards. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Invision via AP) Allison Janney’s Golden Globe-winning portrayal of Tonya Harding’s mother in I Tonya included two constants: drinking and physical abuse of her star figure skater daughter. Harding’s real-life mother, LaVona \\"Sandy\\" Golden, however, told ABC News as part of a two-hour special that she neither consistently abused Harding and the scenes that showed her drinking while Harding skated as a child were inaccurate. “I didn’t abuse any of my children,” Golden said per part of the interview ABC News released ahead of Thursday’s show. “Spanked? Yes, (I) spanked. Absolutely, positively you (have) got to show them right from wrong.” Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story airs on ABC Thursday night (9 p.m. ET). Golden admitted one incident from the movie did occur. “I spanked her once with a hairbrush at a competition,” Golden said. Harding, however, said the abuse wasn’t isolated as Golden contends and the scene where Golden threw a steak knife that lodged in her arm indeed took place. “I was about 10 feet from her,” Harding told ABC News. “It was a steak knife.” Golden said the incident didn't happen. “Why would I throw a steak knife at anybody?” Golden said. “She’s lied so much she doesn’t know what isn’t a lie anymore.” As far as the drinking, Harding told ABC News that she knew at age 11 half a thermos her mother would take to the rink in the morning was filled with “brandy and the rest was coffee.” Golden said it wasn’t actually alcohol. “I would have coffee and sometimes I would put brandy flavoring in it,” Golden said. ||||| Former Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding said that her mother abused her throughout her childhood, including that she once threw a steak knife at her, and that any support from her mother came at an emotional price. “I don’t think that there was more than one day a week, sometimes, that I didn’t get beaten,” Harding told ABC's Amy Robach. But her mother, LaVona \\"Sandy\\" Golden, told ABC News that wasn't the case at all. “I didn’t abuse any of my children,” Golden said. “Spanked? Yes, [I] spanked. Absolutely, positively you [have] got to show them right from wrong.” ABC News Harding and her tumultuous relationship with her mother are receiving new attention in the movie, “I, Tonya,” which was inspired by Harding’s life and includes a scene in which Allison Janney, who plays Golden, throws a steak knife at Harding, played by actress Margot Robbie. Janney won a Golden Globe award Sunday night for her portrayal of Golden. Golden’s new ABC News interview is featured in the two-hour ABC News special “Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story.\\" LaVona Golden Tonya Harding was just 3 years old when she stepped out onto the ice for the first time, and her mother said she knew instantly that her daughter had a talent for figure skating. “Whatever the other people were doing, she turned around right behind them and did the same thing,” Golden said. “She wasn’t supposed to be able to do any of it, but she just went and did it.” “Tonya was my little dynamo,” she added. “I called her my little twinkle, my little star.” LaVona Golden Golden said Harding was the youngest of four children. Harding’s father is Golden’s third husband. She said the family had a modest life together. “Tonya herself called us trailer trash. We were never trailer trash. We had a beautiful new trailer,” Golden said. “We didn’t live in filth or dirt or anything that I would call unusual.” As her childhood progressed, Harding spent most of her days on the ice, practicing and in competitions. Her mother said that she worked overtime to pay for the sport’s expenses, like lessons, costumes and competition fees. LaVona Golden Golden said she had jobs as a waitress, a bartender and a cook, adding, “I was working right around the clock, morning, noon, and night, trying to get the money for her to skate and have lessons…. I had to work sometimes two and three jobs a day trying to make ends meet.” “My mother did pay for skating, but I worked at the rink for my ice time or I worked at the roller rink for my ice time,” Harding told ABC News’ Amy Robach. “It’s a very expensive sport.” Play But Harding said that while her mother helped her pay for skating, that support came with a price. Harding said her mother once hit her in the bathroom at an ice rink, saying, “I remember she dragged me into the bathroom and beat me with a hairbrush, literally.” Golden admitted it. “I spanked her once with a hairbrush at a competition,” said Golden, but claimed that it was an isolated incident. LaVona Golden But Harding alleges that the abuse went far beyond a single swat with a hairbrush. She says that once when she was in high school, her mother threw a steak knife at her, which landed in her forearm. Harding said she tried to leave the house in the middle of a conversation with her mother when she was struck. “And that’s when it happened,” Harding said. “I was about 10 feet from her. It was a steak knife.” However, Golden denies that the incident ever occurred. “Why would I throw a steak knife at anybody?” Golden said, claiming that her daughter has a history of being dishonest. “She’s lied so much she doesn’t know what isn’t a lie anymore.” LaVona Golden Harding became a force of nature on the ice. She skated her way to victory at the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships, where she became the first American woman to land a triple axel in competition, and she went on to compete at the 1992 and the 1994 Winter Olympics. Today, Harding has her own family -- a husband of seven years, and a son. “With my husband and my son, I get my second chance in life to be loved and to be happy,” she said. Golden said she has never met her grandson, and Harding said that’s not going to change. “I don’t want her anywhere near me. I don’t want her anywhere near my son,” Harding said of her mother. “She wants forgiveness. She wants to see me. She wants to make amends. She wants to meet and be part of the family. Hell no.” ||||| And the Golden Globe Award goes to … Allison Janney! The actress took home the statue for best supporting actress in a motion picture at Sunday night’s award show for her role in I, Tonya. Janney portrayed Tonya Harding’s mom, LaVona Fay Golden, in a dramatized version of the true story of figure skater Tonya Harding. Janney thanked screenwriter Steven Rodgers in her acceptance speech for creating a “very distinctive, unique, mother…. of a character.” “What he did is tell a story about class, tell a story about the disenfranchised about a woman who was not embraced for her individuality, tell a story about truth and the perception of truth in the media and the truths we all tell ourselves when we wake up in bed in the morning.” Steve Granitz/WireImage She also gave a shoutout to flu-ridden star Margot Robbie, who played Harding. “Margot, my goodness, she’s a quadruple threat,” Janney said. Be sure to check out PEOPLE’s full Golden Globes coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood’s big night. The actress, 58, told PEOPLE at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association after party that she was “very excited and very proud” of her award. Janney has been earning major Oscar buzz for her role as U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding’s controversial mother LaVona Golden in I, Tonya, which details the skater’s career and 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan that got Harding banned for life from figure skating.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage.

Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who searches the plane wreckage? ? In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

What 2007 film is an over-the-top send-up of action movies, featuring a large amount of violence (including killing by carrots), starring Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci & Paul Giamatti?","completion":"The 2007 film you are referring to is \\"Shoot 'Em Up,\\" a stylized, over-the-top action-comedy directed and written by Michael Davis. The movie stars Clive Owen as Mr. Smith, a mysterious loner with exceptional shooting skills, Monica Bellucci as Donna Quintano, a lactating prostitute, and Paul Giamatti as Hertz, the ruthless and determined villain. \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" pays homage to and parodies various action, crime, and thriller movies, blending excessive violence with tongue-in-cheek humor. Its plot revolves around Mr. Smith, who unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of a gunfight when he tries to save a pregnant woman from being killed. Despite his efforts, the woman dies, and Mr. Smith is left to protect her newborn baby from Hertz and his team of assassins. Donna Quintano becomes an inadvertent ally, using her maternal instincts and street smarts to help Mr. Smith keep the baby safe. One of the film's most distinctive features is its highly imaginative and ludicrously violent action sequences. Mr. Smith uses anything and everything as a weapon, including carrots, which he masterfully employs to kill several enemies. The movie's relentless pace, exaggerated fight scenes, and acrobatic gunplay are purposely overdone to create a sense of exhilaration and exuberance. In addition to its frenetic action, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is also notable for its quick-witted dialogue and biting humor, which further contribute to its send-up of the action genre. The film often pokes fun at action movie clichés and tropes, such as the calm, collected hitman or the seemingly invincible protagonist. By subverting these conventions, Michael Davis crafts a movie that serves as both a tribute to and a send-up of its cinematic predecessors. In conclusion, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is a 2007 film that parodies and celebrates the action genre with its extreme violence, outlandish combat scenes, and dark comedy. Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti deliver memorable performances as they navigate a world filled with over-the-top mayhem and dangerous assassins.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. The writer believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - natural shampoos scent does not stay on the hair - chemical shampoos leave hair looking greasy - not enough information - natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well Answer:","completion":"natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dr. Death is Released Pathologist, angel of mercy, advocate, lightning rod, scofflaw, punchline — to Dr. Jack Kevorkian’s long resume of sobriquets we may now add ex-con. After serving 8 years of a 10-to-25-year sentence for second-degree murder, the doctor walked out of the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Mich., and into the predictable media frenzy. He had only a few offhand, characteristically vinegary remarks for the legions of reporters and camera crews on the scene, but there will be all manner of TV appearances and news conferences in the days and weeks to come, one may be sure. Seventy-nine and not in the best of health himself, Dr. Kevorkian returns on parole to a society that still hasn’t figured out what to do about one of the great unintended consequences of modern science: The growing number of people with profound illnesses whose death can be staved off indefinitely but whose suffering and misery, physical or psychic or both, cannot be meaningfully relieved. The law, medical ethics, religious teachings and the gut feelings of the average Joe or Joan can all be in wildly different places on what’s right and what’s wrong in such cases. It’s fairly well settled that any mentally competent person has the right to refuse medical treatment, even life-saving treatment, and “let nature take its course.” But there is much more widespread disagreement about helping nature along — and that’s the fault line where Dr. Kevorkian stands. When the patient does it himself or herself, say by using the machine Dr. Kevorkian invented, it seems most people would call that suicide — a sin in most religions, but generally not a crime. If anyone else lifts a finger to actively help, even a compassionate doctor whose patient has begged for the help and has no other hope of relief, 49 of the 50 states call that homicide, a stance that the Supreme Court found to be constitutional in two 1997 cases. Oregon is the exception, with a law expressly allowing physicians to assist suicide in certain circumstances, which was passed by referendum in 1994, survived a repeal referendum and has likewise been upheld in the courts. Dr. K’s own sojourns in the legal system have been similarly mixed. As one writer on the subject, Ronald Standler, has pointed out, as long as he listened to good legal advice, Dr. Kevorkian managed to stay out of jail while helping more than 100 people slip the mortal coil at a time of their choosing. Only when he decided to represent himself in court was he convicted and imprisoned. He’s promised not to assist suicides any more; he seems unlikely to want to break parole and go back to jail. But his views on the issue haven’t changed, his associates say, and we’ll doubtless be hearing him expound them quite a bit now that he’s back in circulation. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Dr. Jack Kevorkian, known for his controversial role in physician-assisted suicide, has been released on parole after serving 8 years of a 10-to-25-year sentence for second-degree murder, reigniting debates over the ethical issues surrounding end-of-life care.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who sinks into a deep depression? , can you please find it? Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him. She quickly breaks away, and says she cannot see him any more. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who sinks into a deep depression is Lorna."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood.

In general, a pressure is a force per unit area, across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton's second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth's atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth's surface, thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere. Question: with regard to the pressure gradient force air will always move from low to high pressure?","completion":"Imagine you have two balloons, one big and one small. The big balloon has more air inside, so it has higher pressure, and the small balloon has less air, so it has lower pressure. Now, imagine connecting these two balloons with a tiny straw.

Aliquippa Police Chief Donald Couch Jr. said the loaded .22-caliber revolver was found Monday morning inside a backpack, but they are sure the student meant no harm. Superintendent David Wytiaz told parents that another student told a teacher about the weapon inside a backpack. Administrators at Aliquippa Elementary School secured the firearm and turned it over to Aliquippa police. “It's a very unique situation,” Police Chief Donald Couch Jr. said. “As far as the circumstances, how it got there, I can't go into that.” Police have contacted the child's mother and her boyfriend to determine whether any criminal charges are warranted. The gun came from the boy's home and is registered to someone born in 1914 who police think is dead. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf visited the school that day at around 2:15 p.m. “I can stress that at no time were any students in danger,” Couch said. “We are definitely sure there was no ill will by the student towards anyone.” Wytiaz reiterated that point. “We believe at this point, there was no threat made or anything like that,” Wytiaz said. “The gun was removed without anyone seeing it.” Channel 11’s Gordon Loesch reported the child who had the gun is 5 or 6 years old. The boy’s family told Channel 11’s Courtney Brennan that the boy wasn’t being aggressive. He simply was trying to protect his younger brothers. “For them to say he’s aggressive, that’s a lie,” said his godmother, Nicole Lutle. “It’s not that this child was bad. It’s not that this child had a temper because all of that is a lie.” According to Lutle and other family friends, the boy found the gun on a bed inside his apartment in the Linmar Terrace housing complex Sunday night. “He picked it up because he didn’t want his little brother to get to it,” Lutle said. “He knew his little brother wouldn’t go through his book bag, so he put it in his book bag and forgot it was in there. The boy’s younger brother is 3 years old. “He’s a very sweet kid. He wasn’t taking the gun to school to hurt anyone,” Lutle said. Lutle doesn't condone what happened but said this kindergartener and his siblings need help. “We have to show these kids more love because if we don’t show them, what do they think they have?\\" she said. On Tuesday, several parents told Channel 11’s Gordon Loesch that they’re angry and fearful after the incident. “My son, they all ride the bus together. I feel really scared for him,” said Darryce McCoy. A letter was sent home to parents Tuesday, but some said they should have been notified sooner. “That’s not good enough. We need to know when it happens,” Smith said. The Associated Press and Channel 11’s news exchange partners at TribLIVE contributed to this report. ||||| School has just begun for most kids, and along with the pencils and notebooks that the students brought to one school in Pennsylvania was a gun -- a loaded gun. It was found in a 5-year-old's backpack in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, after a classmate told the teacher about it. These kids are in kindergarten. And there was a loaded gun in a kindergarten student's backpack. Terrifying. The boy was suspended, but I don't think he should have been. He has a very good reason why he brought the gun to school. The child said he found it on a bed in his house and didn't want his 3-year-old brother to get it, so he packed it in a place he thought was safe. The child's grandmother, Nicole Lutle, spoke to WPXI and said: He put it in his book bag and forgot it was in there .... For them to say he’s aggressive, that’s a lie. It’s not that this child was bad. It’s not that this child had a temper because all of that is a lie. This whole story is worrisome on so many levels. I have 5-year-old twins who are in kindergarten. The thought of either of them somehow handling a loaded gun scares me to my core. The thought of them being in a classroom where another child brings in a gun is equally frightening. I am so thankful this story didn't turn out worse. But I also do not think this child should be suspended -- his parents should be. They should be charged somehow. If what this child said was true, he was protecting his 3-year-old brother. He didn't want him to get the gun, which was reportedly loaded and lying on a bed in their home. That decision may have saved this boy's brother's life. Of course there are so many ways this could have played out and thank everything everywhere that no one was harmed. Kids and guns do not mix in my opinion. Ever. Not even at a shooting range -- the story of a 9-year-old accidentally killing her firing range instructor is proof of that. But I just can't stop thinking about a loaded gun lying on a bed with a 3- and 5-year-old in the home. I can't stop thinking that what this kid did was sincerely what he thought was the right thing. What do you think? Should the child be suspended? Should any action be taken against the parents?

Some parents were killed, others were unharmed when soldiers came calling. Investigators examined period between 1977 and 1989, 'peak' adoption period. Reports says many more could have been taken, investigation underway. Article:","completion":"Title: Tragic Truth: Children Stolen for Foreign Adoption in the 20th Century Revealed by Report Introduction In recent years, reports have been surfacing about the dark history involving the stealing and trafficking of children for adoption in various countries across Europe and North America. A new investigative report has recently shed light on this tragic issue and the heart-wrenching stories of innocent families torn apart during the peak adoption period between 1977 and 1989. This astonishing discovery has unveiled the untold horrors faced by countless children and their families, and pushed for a thorough investigation into this deeply rooted problem. Paragraph 1: Countries and Adoption Trends The report highlights cases in countries like the United States, Sweden, Italy, and France, where desperate couples seeking to adopt a child often unwittingly became accessories to this illicit industry. The children, many of whom were unaware of their backgrounds, were taken from their families and put up for adoption against the wishes of their birth parents. The investigation focuses on the peak adoption period between 1977 and 1989, with the report surmising that so many more children may have been taken from their families during this time. Paragraph 2: Parents' Survival Rates In chilling detail, the report describes the events that unfolded when soldiers came calling to take these innocent children from their homes. Some parents were tragically killed, further illustrating the brutality of these abductions. The parents who were spared met with other unimaginable horrors, as they were forced to watch their children being taken away from them. In the aftermath, several distraught families spent years desperately searching for their loved ones. Paragraph 3: Ongoing Investigations An ongoing investigation has been launched to determine the extent of these abductions and to identify those involved in these criminal activities. As the truth continues to unravel, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this problem is rooted far deeper than initially thought. It also speaks volumes to the corruption and lack of oversight in the adoption process in the past. Conclusion: Hope for Justice With this new report, light has been shed on one of the most tragic cases of child abduction and human trafficking in modern history. As the investigation progresses, victims and their families can finally begin to seek justice, and governments worldwide need to address and learn from these painful lessons of the past. The ongoing investigation will hopefully aim to reunite families that were systematically separated and ensure that measures are put in place to prevent future tragedies of this nature."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: \\"What were the desired solution?\\" Context: \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The desired solution in the context of Indian independence was to address the demands and concerns of both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League while ensuring a peaceful transition of power. The steps taken in an attempt to reach this solution were: 1. Recognizing the pressing need for Indian independence: The Labour government, led by Clement Attlee, made it a priority to address Indian independence following their election in 1945. 2. Acknowledging the differing positions of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League: Congress wanted a unified secular Indian state, while the Muslim League sought a separate Muslim state in Muslim-majority regions. 3. Assessing the urgency of the situation: With increasing civil unrest and potential for civil war, the British government realized that a swift resolution was necessary, leading to Attlee promising independence by 1948 and Lord Mountbatten bringing the date forward to 15 August 1947. 4. Partitioning India based on religious demographics: To address the concerns of both parties, the British drew borders to broadly separate Hindu and Muslim areas, which ultimately led to the creation of two independent states, India and Pakistan. 5. Ensuring the independence of other nations previously under British influence: Burma and Sri Lanka gained their independence in 1948, with India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka becoming members of the Commonwealth. However, it is important to note that the desired solution did not entirely mitigate the issues at hand, as it led to mass migrations, violence, and the loss of lives among the Hindu and Muslim communities."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc Chief Executive Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have been conducting behind-the-scenes talks about a range of intellectual property matters, including the mobile patent disputes between the companies, people familiar with the matter said. The two executives had a phone conversation last week, the sources said. Discussions involving lower-level officials of the two companies are also ongoing. Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set, the sources said on Thursday. One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear. The two companies are keeping lines of communication open at a high level against the backdrop of Apple's legal victory in a patent infringement case against Samsung, which uses Google's Android software. Last Friday, a jury awarded Apple 1.05 billion in damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some Samsung products in a case that has been widely viewed as a \\"proxy war\\" between Apple and Google. One possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in Google's Android mobile software, one source said. But it was unclear whether Page and Cook were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies, most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area, or are focused on a more limited set of issues. Competition between Google and Apple has heated up in recent years with the shift from PCs to mobile devices. Google's Android software, which Apple's late founder Steve Jobs denounced as a \\"stolen product,\\" has become the world's No.1 smartphone operating system. The popularity of the software has been in tandem with patent infringement lawsuits involving various hardware vendors who use it, including Samsung and HTC. The latest complaint was filed by Motorola Mobility, now a unit of Google, against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming some features of Apple's devices infringe on its patents. A previous lawsuit between the two in a Chicago court was thrown out by a federal judge, who said neither side could prove damages. Apple in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on Google's products. Apple recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software, replacing the Google product used in the iPhone, and said it would no longer offer Google's YouTube as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its iPhone. Cook took the helm at Apple a year ago, and Page stepped into the top job at Google a few months before that. The conversation between Page and Cook last week did not result in any formal agreement, but the two executives agreed to continue talking, according to one source. Google's Larry Page, who sat out several public speaking engagements earlier this summer because of an unspecified medical condition affecting his voice, has continued to run Google's business. Apple and Google declined to comment on any discussions. (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Poornima Gupta with additional reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Martin Howell and Leslie Gevirtz) ||||| CNET confirms that Google CEO Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have held at least one conversation and plan to talk again in bid to settle lingering patent disputes. Maybe Google got the hint after watching what happened to Samsung last week, but CNET has confirmed that the CEOs of Apple and Google have held at least one conversation in a bid to resolve the myriad intellectual property and patent disputes between the companies. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page talked before last week's verdict in the Samsung-Apple trial and plan to talk in a few weeks, according to a person familiar with dealings. The news of the conversations between the two CEOs was first reported by Reuters. Reuters also reported that talks are also taking place between the companies at a lower echelon. Google declined comment. We've reached out to Apple and will update the post when we hear back. But you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind's blowing. After its one-sided court victory last week over Samsung in a landmark copy infringement lawsuit, Apple has added incentive to press its legal claims against other computer makers who use Google's Android operating system. When the Samsung decision got announced last Friday afternoon, Google immediately attempted to distance itself from the case, declaring that most of the patents in question \\"don't relate to the core Android operating system.\\" Given the lopsided nature of Samsung's legal defeat, Google may believe the prospects of an Apple lawsuit are higher than they were just a week ago. \\"Theoretically they could hold Google responsible for all of the harm that Android allegedly causes to Apple, but it's a much more difficult story to tell to a judge and, especially, a jury,\\" noted Florian Mueller, a legal analyst who writes a widely-read blog about intellectual property and patent law. \\"It's also more difficult to get an injunction against someone who doesn't compete with you directly, only indirectly.\\" Meanwhile, the repercussions of Apple-Samsung are still reverberating. Earlier this week, the Korea Times reported that Samsung and several U.S. carriers were seeking to find ways to modify their designs to avoid further legal entanglements with Apple. Of more direct concern to Apple, the paper also reported considering warming up to Microsoft and reducing its reliance upon Google's Android platform.\\" The companies are already involved in litigation through Google's ownership of Motorola Mobility. A couple of weeks back, Motorola Mobility filed another lawsuit against Apple in a move to block the company from importing the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and certain Macs. This was part of a longer back-and-forth patent fight that's raged for years between Apple and Motorola. At the same time, the companies were able to reach a tentative deal a few days ago to license out certain Motorola patents to Apple. |||||Summary:","completion":"Google CEO Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have had behind-the-scenes talks about intellectual property issues, including mobile patent disputes.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

The Verve were an English rock band formed in Wigan in 1990 by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bass guitarist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound with their debut LP The band's physical and mental turmoil continued into the chaotic recording sessions of the band's second album, 1995's A Northern Soul, produced by Owen Morris. The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of A Storm in Heaven and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft's vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft, Noel Gallagher, dedicated the song \\"Cast No Shadow\\" on the album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? to Ashcroft, and Ashcroft returned the gesture by dedicating the song \\"A Northern Soul\\" to Noel. The band released the album's first single \\"This Is Music\\" in May, and it reached No. 35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by \\"On Your Own\\" in June which performed even better, reaching No. 28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single \\"History\\", which reached No. 24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: \\"I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with \\"History\\" doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away.\\" Ashcroft reunited with Jones and Salisbury just a few weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, but he spent only a couple of days with the band. The band then chose Simon Tong, a school friend credited with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances for all of 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York. The rest of the year was spent playing and recording songs for a new album.

After the financial crisis of 2007–08, it was known in 2008–2009 that two Portuguese banks (Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) and Banco Privado Português (BPP)) had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes. In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the Portuguese people in general. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why was the case of BPN more serious?","completion":"The case of Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) was more serious for a few reasons: 1. Size and market share: BPN was a larger bank with a significant market share in Portugal. Its collapse could have had a more pronounced impact on the overall stability of the Portuguese banking system and financial markets. A failure of BPN could potentially trigger a loss in confidence among the public and other financial institutions, leading to a larger systemic crisis. 2. Political implications: The fact that Portugal's then-current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO made the situation more delicate. This connection raised questions about the integrity of the political establishment and its potential role in the bank's failure or in the decision-making process of granting a bailout. 3. The nature of the crimes: The CEO of BPN was charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes, which made the case even more severe. This suggests that the bank's issues were not only due to bad investments but also due to criminal activities, which could have potentially led to further investigations and legal actions against the bank and its leadership, extending the consequences beyond the financial aspect. In summary, the case of BPN was more serious due to its size and market share, the political implications, and the nature of the crimes associated with its failure. These factors made the potential consequences of BPN's collapse more significant than those of Banco Privado Português (BPP) and further justified the government's decision to provide a bailout to prevent a potentially more severe financial crisis in Portugal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Now, I have a new situation: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E.

Movie plot title: Lake Dead Movie plot: Three sisters, Brielle, Kelli, and Sam, are on a college break. They discover that their grandfather has just died and he has left them a motel in his will. Their father, John, tries to persuade them not to go, but the sisters ignore him and head off, accompanied by their friends: Tanya, Ben, Bill, and Bill's girlfriend, Amy. Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, an iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles. Afterwards, the three are in a boat, where the inbreds tie a badly beaten Sam's legs to a concrete block, and dump her into the water, where she is still alive as the concrete block pulls her beneath the water, where she drowns. The rest drive to the motel and meet the caretaker, an old lady who appears kind. After finding a lake on their property, the group of friends take a swim, not noticing that Sam's dead body is floating in the lake beneath them. After the swim, the friends return to their trailer, where they set up a small campsite. Bill and Tanya go out to the woods to get some firewood, and end up having sex (much to the chagrin of Amy). After encounters with large, strange-looking, unkempt men, the friends are terrified. Bill, Tanya, and Amy are butchered, while the remaining friends escape but are picked up by a mysterious, pushy cop. He tricks them into coming back to the motel where everything slowly falls into place. It is later revealed that the cop and caretaker are all a part of the evil scheme to make Brielle and Kelli a part of their devious plans.

Yes; Is this product review positive? Title: Disappointed!! Review: You are showing it with a handle and there is none. It is made good but it is not like in the picture. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The product review in question is not positive. The reasons for this are outlined in two parts: Firstly, the title \\"Disappointed!!\\" already indicates a negative sentiment. The title of a review often summarizes the sentiment of the reviewer and in this case, expressing disappointment typically suggests an unfulfilled expectation or a negative experience with the product. Secondly, the content of the review provides specific reasons for the user's disappointment. The reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the product didn't come with a handle even though the picture showed it did. This suggests that the product did not meet the customer's expectations based on the information provided during the purchase process. Misrepresentation of a product in its description or image can lead to a breach of trust and disappointment, which are displayed in this review. The customer, while indicating that the product was \\"made good\\", firmly asserts that it doesn't match what was shown in the picture. Although this is a partial positive comment indicating that the quality or craftsmanship may be acceptable, it does not negate the overall negative sentiment. In summary, while there is an element of positivity regarding the quality of the product, the overall tone and message of the review is negative. This is due to the product not matching its representation and the resulting disappointment, which was significant enough to elicit this review. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that this is not a positive review in its entirety."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - Music notation or musical notation is any system used to visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols, including ancient symbols or modern musical symbols and including ancient symbols cut into stone, made in clay tablets or made using a pen on papyrus, parchment or manuscript paper; printed using a printing press (ca. 1400s), a computer printer (ca. 1980s) or other printing or modern copying technology. Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional classical music performers, sheet music using staves and note heads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional country music session musicians, the Nashville Number System is the main method. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - A string quartet is a musical ensemble of four string players two violin players, a viola player and a cellist or a piece written to be performed by such a group. The string quartet is one of the most prominent chamber ensembles in classical music, with most major composers, from the mid to late 18th century onwards, writing string quartets. - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - Giulietta e Romeo is a dramma per musica by composer Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli with an Italian libretto by Giuseppe Maria Foppa after the 1530 novella of the same name by Luigi da Porto . The opera premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 30 January 1796 . Giulietta e Romeo was composed by Zingarelli in only eight days and it is considered by many scholars to be his best work . The opera remained a part of the Italian repertory well into the nineteenth century and the role of Romeo was a favourite vehicle for Maria Malibran until c 1830 . - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.

Symptoms: Although high temperatures can induce certain symptoms such as sweating or dehydration, this option is not directly related to the given facts about combustion and dioxin production. 2. Dioxins: As stated in Fact 2, dioxins are byproducts of combustion processes. Given that high temperatures can cause an object to combust (Fact 1), it is logical to conclude that high temperatures can result in the production of dioxins. 3. Rise: This option is vague, but if it refers to a rise in temperature, then it could be indirectly related to the facts provided. High temperatures leading to combustion can cause a localized spike in temperature, leading to a rise in the given area. However, this is not a direct consequence of high temperatures as specified in the facts. 4. Pollution: Dioxins, being byproducts of combustion, are known to be harmful to both human health and the environment. Given that high temperatures lead to combustion and the subsequent production of dioxins, it is reasonable to conclude that high temperatures can cause pollution. 5. Anemia: The term anemia refers to a medical condition with a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. While high temperatures could potentially exacerbate anemia symptoms, such as fatigue, there is no direct correlation to the facts provided on combustion and dioxins. 6. Allergies: Allergies are immune system responses to specific substances or environmental factors. High temperatures can contribute to certain allergic reactions, such as those involving pollen, but this option is not directly tied to the facts provided about combustion and dioxin production. 7. Disease: Diseases are typically caused by pathogenic organisms or various other factors. While high temperatures can play a role in disease transmission or the exacerbation of certain symptoms, the given facts on combustion and dioxins do not directly link high temperatures to disease. 8. Sweating: Sweating is a natural response to high temperatures as the body attempts to regulate its internal temperature. While this option is relevant to high temperatures, it is not directly linked to the facts provided on combustion and dioxin production. In conclusion, given the two facts provided, high temperatures can cause the production of dioxins (option 2) and subsequently lead to pollution (option 4).

Your job is to classify the command into one of these seven categories: (1) majority, (2) unique, (3) superlative, (4) count, (5) comparative, (6) aggregation, and (7) ordinal. Here are the defications of each category: 1. majority: Describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 2. unique: Describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 3. Superlative: Describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 4. Ordinal: Describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 5. Comparative: Comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column 6. Count: counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 7. Aggregation: Describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows. Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command: 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments. 13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument. 14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument. 15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument. 16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table 17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. 20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. and { greater { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; collingwood } ; crowd } ; hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; carlton } ; crowd } } ; and { eq { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; collingwood } ; away team } ; south melbourne } ; eq { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; carlton } ; away team } ; geelong } } } A:","completion":"The given command is: and { greater { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; collingwood } ; crowd } ; hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; carlton } ; crowd } } ; and { eq { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; collingwood } ; away team } ; south melbourne } ; eq { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; home team ; carlton } ; away team } ; geelong } } } Let's break down the command to understand what it's doing: 1. filter_eq is used to get subviews of all rows where the home team is Collingwood and Carlton separately. 2. hop is used to get the crowd values for both filtered subviews. 3. greater is used to compare the crowd values of the two filtered subviews (Collingwood and Carlton) 4. eq is used to check if the away team in both the filtered subviews is South Melbourne for Collingwood and Geelong for Carlton. 5. and combines the result of greater and eq. The command compares two rows in the table (Collingwood and Carlton) to check which row has a larger crowd value and if their away teams are equal to specific values. Therefore, this command falls under the category of (5) comparative as it compares two rows in the table regarding their values in one column (crowd)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her wish to save sweet potatoes in Kenya. (B). Her great interest in genetic engineering. (C). Her love for sweet potatoes. (D). Her interest in plant life. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Scientist Florence Wambugu works with farmers in Kenya, a country in East Africa. She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.

He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all.

This article: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat.

The work was well done, for the amount paid. Color matched and dents were not to be seen. However, I did notice a few scratches on my driver side fender area that I know were not there before I dropped it off.

Answer: The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart . Question: what is the song heart shaped box about Answer:","completion":"\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, released in 1993 as the lead single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero.\\" The song was written by the band's frontman, Kurt Cobain, who also contributed to the music and lyrics. While the international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, the meaning and interpretation of the song have been a subject of much debate and speculation among fans and music critics alike. Kurt Cobain never explicitly stated the meaning behind \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" which has left fans exploring a variety of interpretations for the song. Some of the most common theories about the meaning of \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" include: 1. Love and Relationships: Many people believe that the song is about the complexities of love and relationships, with the heart being a prevalent symbol of love. The \\"heart-shaped box\\" could represent the vulnerability and emotional turmoil of being in love, with the box acting as a metaphor for the fragility and complexity of human emotions. 2. Drug Addiction: Another interpretation of \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" relates to Cobain's struggles with drug addiction, specifically heroin. The lyrics \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" might refer to the self-destructive nature of addiction and the desire to save someone you love from the harmful effects of substance abuse. 3. Cobain's Relationship with Courtney Love: Some fans have speculated that \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" was written about Cobain's relationship with his wife, Courtney Love, and the difficulties they faced as a couple. It is said that Love had given Cobain a heart-shaped box as a present, which could have inspired the song's title and imagery. The lyrics of the song could be interpreted as Cobain's reflection on their tumultuous relationship. 4. Exploring the Dark Side of Human Nature: Another possible interpretation of the song is that it explores the darker side of human nature, including aspects such as depression, addiction, and unhealthy relationships. The imagery in the lyrics and the accompanying music video directed by Anton Corbijn contain elements of surrealism, and the juxtaposition of beautiful and grotesque images can leave a lasting impression on the listener. 5. Confronting Mortality and Suffering: The song could be interpreted as a reflection on the inevitability of suffering and death. The line \\"I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\\" might suggest a sense of entrapment and existential angst, while the references to cancer and the blackened emotional state could represent the pain and fear that come with facing one's mortality. In conclusion, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a complex and multi-layered song that can be interpreted in various ways. The song may be about love and relationships, drug addiction, Cobain's relationship with Courtney Love, the dark side of human nature, confronting mortality and suffering, or a combination of these themes. While its meaning remains open to interpretation, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" stands as a powerful and evocative example of Nirvana's masterful songwriting and Cobain's poignant lyrical style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first stamp marking the opening of the White Olympics was issued on January 25th, 1932 in the United states to celebrate the 3rd White Olympics. From then on, issuing stamps during the White Olympics became a tradition. To observe the 4th Winter Olympic Games, a group of stamps were published in Germany in November, 1935. The five rings of the Olympics were printed on the front of the sportswear. It was the first time that the symbol appeared on stamps of the Winter Olympics. In the 1950s, the stamps of this kind became more color1ful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as the non-host countries published stamps to mark those Games. China also published four stamps in February, 1980, when the Chinese sportsmen began to march into the area of the Winter Olympics. Japan is the only Asian country that has ever held the White Olympics. Altogether 14,500 million stamps were sold to raise funds for the sports meet. Different kinds of sports were represented on these small stamps. People can enjoy the beauty of the wonderful movements of the athletes. Question: The White Olympics and the Winter Olympics are _ .

Here is a hypothesis: They ran in once they saw those weapons were better. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To understand if the hypothesis can be concluded based on the premise, let's break down the information in both statements: Premise: 1. They saw an advantage. 2. They rushed in as a result of seeing the advantage. Hypothesis: 1. They saw better weapons. 2. They ran in as a result of seeing the better weapons. Now, let's analyze each part step-by step: Step 1: Analyze the advantage observed In the premise, the nature of the advantage is not specified. In the hypothesis, the advantage is specifically described as seeing better weapons. Since the premise does not provide any specific information about the advantage, we cannot confirm that it refers to the better weapons mentioned in the hypothesis. Step 2: Analyze their actions upon seeing the advantage In the premise, the action is that they rushed in after observing the advantage. In the hypothesis, the action is that they ran in after seeing better weapons. Rushing in and running in are similar actions, so this part of the hypothesis aligns with the premise. Conclusion: Although the actions align between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise, because the nature of the advantage is not specified in the premise. It is possible that the advantage observed is related to better weapons, but it could also refer to a different advantage entirely. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In addition to this, Maine Coons are a large and beautiful breed that are expensive to purchase. While it's rare, people do steal Maine Coons they see outdoors. For your cat's safety, keep it as an indoor cat only. A clean litter box is important to any cat. Maine Coons in particular, due to their long hair, require a clean litter box. Debris from litter can easily get caught in their fur, so clean your litter box daily. Each day, scoop any feces or clumps of urine out of the litter box and add a small amount of fresh litter. Swap the litter out completely once every two to three weeks. When you do so, make sure to scrub out the inside of the box and let it dry before replacing the litter. Maine Coons are one of the most social cat breeds. They do not do well without daily attention. Make sure to give your Maine Coon plenty of love to keep it happy. Maine Coons may follow you around. You can pet them on occasion, but if you're busy they're generally happy to observe you. It's a good idea to pet them and snuggle at the end of the day, when you have time. In addition to keeping your cat active, playing can help you bond with your Maine Coon. Maine Coons, due to their friendly demeanor, generally do well with young children. However, interaction should be supervised. Maine Coons are tolerant of children, as long as kids are taught to handle them gently. Encourage your kids to treat your cat with respect. Let them know they should only handle your cat when it comes to them and should not attempt to grab or restrain a Maine Coon. Young children may sometimes try to dress up an animal, or place it in a toy like a toy high chair or stroller. Maine Coons are more tolerant of this behavior than many house cats, but you should still keep an eye on your kids when they play with your Maine Coon. Make sure the cat does not seem aggressive or frightened during play. Summary:","completion":"Keep Maine Coons safe indoors, clean their litter box daily, give them lots of attention and playtime, and teach kids to handle them gently for a happy, healthy cat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
