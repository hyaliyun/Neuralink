Here are the main differences between granite and marble: Composition: Granite: Granite is an igneous rock composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma beneath the Earth's surface. The interlocking mineral crystals give granite its characteristic speckled appearance.Marble: [LINKED_TEXT: Marble] [URL: https://www.rajasthan-stone-exporter.com/marble-exporter.php], on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock primarily composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, usually calcite or dolomite. It forms from the metamorphism of limestone, a sedimentary rock, under high heat and pressure. Appearance: Granite: Granite has a distinctive granular texture with visible mineral grains, giving it a speckled or \\"salt-and-pepper\\" appearance. It comes in a wide range of colors, including various shades of white, gray, black, pink, and brown.Marble: Marble often features a smooth and elegant appearance with characteristic veining patterns. It comes in various colors, including white, gray, green, pink, and even rare hues like blue. Marble's veining adds to its visual appeal and uniqueness. Hardness: Granite: Granite is a very hard and durable stone, ranking around 6 to 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. It is highly resistant to scratching and suitable for high-traffic areas.Marble: Marble is softer compared to granite, with a Mohs hardness of around 3 to 5. It is more susceptible to scratching and etching from acidic substances. Use and Applications: Granite: Due to its hardness and durability, granite is commonly used for countertops, flooring, and outdoor applications such as cladding, paving, and monuments.Marble: Marble's elegant appearance makes it popular for use in sculptures, decorative accents, and interior applications such as flooring, wall cladding, and countertops in low-traffic areas. Porosity: Granite: Granite is relatively less porous than marble, which means it is more resistant to liquid absorption and staining.Marble: Marble is more porous, making it susceptible to water absorption and staining, especially if not properly sealed and maintained. Maintenance: Granite: Granite requires minimal maintenance, typically needing only regular cleaning and occasional sealing to protect the surface.Marble: Marble requires more care and attention to maintain its appearance. It needs periodic sealing to protect against staining and etching from acidic substances. In summary, granite is a durable and versatile stone commonly used for functional purposes like countertops and outdoor applications, while marble is prized for its elegant appearance and is often used for decorative elements and interior applications. The choice between granite and marble depends on the specific requirements of the project, considering factors such as aesthetics, durability, and maintenance needs."},{"prompt":"When the Apollo 11 lunar module was attempting to land, Commander Neil Armstrong had to take control of the ship manually to land it safely because of an unsafe landing area.

For this trading session, you just need to understand the market structure and the upcoming pumps. Basically, one of us can’t make money just by doing trading individually, hence people use to join telegram channels, WhatsApp groups. They collectively invest in an currency/stock and due to this collectiveness, the price of that particular thing goes up, nearly upto 3100% (maximum seen by me). There are several groups and channels which use to do this kind of activities. No one of them will face loss. Ex. - I the current price of a particular stock is 5₹. They all collectively place their order at the same time. And the price start moving upwards. These kind of activities attract people out of the groups, and they also invest their money in it. This all makes the market to pump much more higher. And the amount of that particular stock may reach 40₹. All the group members collectively square-off their positions. Hence, the overall profit is 8 times the invested amount. Far better than jobs and FDs. And all these make people rich even without doing job from 9 - 5. Hope you understand this.

US District Judge Moxila Upadhyaya referred to Donald Trump as “Mr. Trump” and not “ Mr. President”.","completion":"He is not President."},{"prompt":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","completion":"The use of microwave ovens to cook food has been a major source of debate for decades. While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

They supported several pillars necessary for the Renaissance to occur: banking, art, and architecture. At the time."},{"prompt":"Are there any disadvantages in using robots?","completion":"Sure…but it’s complicated. Let’s imagine that someone invents a robot that can replace humans in a fast-food restaurant…and I’m going to pick one of the most well-known robot - Boston Dynamics’ “Spot”… This little robot is about the size of a large dog - and costs 75,000 - I suspect that’s WITHOUT the robot arm on the top - which is an optional extra. You’ll also need to program it to do the actual job. So I’m going to say that MAYBE 100,000 would suffice…certainly it’s not going to be much cheaper than that. According to Zippia - a human fast food worker gets paid an average of 11 per hour. i’m going to round that down to 10 to keep the math simple. So you could employ a human for 10,000 hours for the price of our robotic worker. An average worker does about 2,000 hours work per year - so the robot will pay for itself in 5 years…assuming it doesn’t need too much maintenance and doesn’t wear out in that time. For a large fast-food company - that might not be a terrible deal. You need thousands of these robots - so you can afford to invest a lot of money in customizing the software - you can design new equipment specially for the robot to use, etc, etc. But for a “Mom & Pop” diner - this is impossible. Investing 100,000 in ANYTHING is incredibly difficult - and a pay-back time of 5 years until it starts being cheaper than hiring a person is way too long. But worse still - the robot has to somehow be taught every subtle nuance of the job. If the customer says “Hold the lettuce” - then maybe the bot can cope with that. But “Can I have hot-sauce instead of mayo on the chicken and no pickles on the burger?”…that’s going to be tough for the robot to deal with. At Tesla’s investor day recently - it was estimated that Tesla’s new humanoid robot could cost 20,000 - and that’s getting down into the realms of the possible. With a payback time of just ONE year - it starts to look more feasible. If enough small fast food places would see that as attractive - then maybe a larger company will design software for that specific market and amortize the cost over MANY small businesses. So the key here is the cost of these devices - if someone could make a robot that could do the job for 10,000 then a six month payback time would be compelling to nearly every restaurant. No doubt robots lack the flexibility of humans - if a customer spills an entire cup of soda onto the floor - a human can grab a mop and bucket and without any training - deal with it. Adding that sophistication to a robot would be VERY tough. However, with that human flexibility comes fallibility. Humans get sick and don’t turn up for work. If that’s the guy with the keys to the restaurant - then your business doesn’t open on time. If someone quits mid-shift then chaos ensues and lots of customers get pissed at you. Robots are reliable…they have limited skills - but they perform them well every time. CONCLUSION: Sure - there are situations where robots are an incredibly valuable thing for a business - but mostly in LARGE businesses. For small operations, one or two human employees are zero investment - and can ensure much better reliability."},{"prompt":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","completion":"When bed time came for my boys I devised a game for when they didn't want to go to sleep which they agreed to. If they could lay motionless for five minutes and pretend they were asleep I'd let them stay up as long as they wanted to. Everytime one of them would snicker or open their eyes the time would start over. Not one time did they make it to the five minute mark. Fast asleep every time. It work for about three years.

Any charge of Treason would be, or at least should be, dismissed on motion as insufficient as a matter of law. It is not even a close question. Snowden was indicted for violation of the Espionage Act and for Theft of Government property a decade ago and if US authorities can ever acquire jurisdiction and custody of him, he will be prosecuted on those pending charges His Russian citizenship will not be a defense or shield him from the charges he faces in the pending indictment, but it might shield him from extradition."},{"prompt":"As an American, do you agree that statistics that show the US way down low at #37 for quality of healthcare is farleft propaganda that folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand love to repeat, when in reality the US is always #1?","completion":"No, it is true."},{"prompt":"lost my email password.

A number of the people present are there to have their professional lives massively improved by a moment of concentrated approval and applause, and leading up to that moment, during the time when so many people there are in the running for that big positive kick from the Academy, the Academy toys with them a bit by hiring a comedian to make fun of as many of them as he (have there been any women?) possibly can in the time he has. Every single person there knows that if they’re famous to the public they’re subject to being roasted, that is, sarcastically made fun of, and Jada Pinkett and Will certainly fit in that category, and had every reason to expect to be made fun of. Whether people enjoy it or not, one has to consider that it is an honor, because little known people aren’t teased, only very famous ones. Jada doesn’t have some medical condition, unless you consider ever person in the country who has thinning or thin hair to be sick, which would make every man with male pattern baldness and every woman with hair loss during menopause, which is most, to be sick. Jada has been putting intense pressure on her hair for hears, if you look at her hairstyles, they are a high-tension war between competing rows of hair; that’s why she had previous described herself as suffering from traction alopecia, something that is self-induced. And the word “alopecia”, which the media suddenly decided to describe as a “medical condition”? It simply means thinning hair, which occurs for most Americans by her age. Jada, who isn’t known for anything other than harassing and tormenting her poor cuckold husband in his home and by having sex with his children’s friends and making sure everyone knows it who possibly could, has decided that her celebrity cause is her own hair. So she shaved her head, something she doesn’t have to do, and the only obvious bit of hair loss is a very thin line that looks like she had a procedure of some kind, like scalp reduction, but other than that, she has lots of healthy hair follicles all over her head, as visible as will’s shame each time he’s made one of his insincere apologies one of his “people” have insisted that he further embarrass himself with. There was absolutely nothing for Will to react to or respond to. All he did was destroy his career for good. Would I have done the same thing to Chris Rock? You mean would I have taken over the entire Oscars ceremony on live national TV, committed a criminal act of violence, and then pimp-walked off with confidence and pride before returning to my seat so I could yell more pimp-culture nonsense at a man doing his job by comparing my wife, a woman who made a big announcement just before the Oscars that she didn’t care what anyone said about her hair—an invitation if ever there was one to freely make comments about her celebrity cause she can’t stop talking about? No. And if I were there and that a-hole still got his award, I wouldn’t have stood up and clapped for him either. I would have stayed in my seat and waved my first finger back and forth in disapproval and hoped I ended up being shown on the broadcast as the only person in the room with any character or courage, but there were no such people there that night. Will Smith is finished, for good, and Jada is hated as well. So,did he help matters with his assault and yelling?"},{"prompt":"NFL continues to drop in Nielsen ratings for playoffs 2023, down 9.46% almost double digits. Why are people not watching NFL?

The brother spent two years in jail. How did he live for 2 whole years with the stain of raping his own sister? God! Three things hurt me: Indian legal system, which kept him in prison for two years.Indian laws, which can be misused by women.Indian men, who are far from getting benifit of doubt not only in court but also in society.

Aloe vera has many benefits for the skin, including moisturizing, soothing, and reducing inflammation. However, it's important to keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, and some people may be more sensitive to aloe vera than others. It's always a good idea to do a patch test on a small area of skin first to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction or sensitivity to the gel. Additionally, it's important to use pure aloe vera gel and avoid any products that contain alcohol or other harsh chemicals, which can irritate the skin and cause dryness or redness. Overall, applying aloe vera gel on the face overnight can be a safe and effective way to improve the health and appearance of the skin. However, it's always best to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your skin or the use of aloe vera."},{"prompt":"Why do some gun control opponents feel that the second amendment guarantees the right to own any type of gun whatsoever?","completion":"The Second Amendment says arms which covers all firearms plus some other things.

Here are the steps to follow for recommended vinyl plank installation. Get your work area ready with appropriate tools. Tape Measure, Utility Knife, Jigsaw, Tapping Block or Rubber Mallet, Pull Bar, ¼\\" Spacers, T-Square, Safety Glasses, Broom or Vacuum and, if necessary, tools for subfloor repair. Prepare the subfloor and / or take up any existing flooring, swept clean the subfloor, skim coat with ardex feather finish any low spots. All subfloors must be clean, flat, dry, and structurally sound. The correct preparation of the subfloor is a major part of a successful installation. When laying the floor, you should start laying the planks along the length of the longest wall of your room. Take the position of your windows and the direction of the light into account, too. Ideally, the light will fall along the long length of the boards. Also, take a look at the direction of any other flooring adjoining the room. Ideally, you’ll want the boards to run in the same direction. Layout Step 1: Begin installation working from left to right. Insert spacers at ends and edges where flooring meet wall. Step 2: Lock short end of flooring by inserting tongue into groove at an angle and drop in place. At end of the row, measure and cut the flooring to complete the row. Install the cut edge closest to the wall. Step 3: Use leftover flooring from first row as starter for second row. There must be at least 20cm between flooring end joints on adjacent rows. FOR TILE INSTALLATIONS: The distance between end joints should be equal to 30cm for proper appearance. Step 4: Lock long edge of flooring by inserting tongue into groove at an angle and drop in place. Slide flooring toward end of previously installed flooring until the tongue just touches the groove. Step 5: IMPORTANT! Use hammer and tapping block to tap long edge of plank to ensure a tight fit. ANY GAPPING CAN COMPROMISE THE LOCKING SYSTEM! Step 6: Attach a scrap piece of floor to bridge the gap between ends of planks. Step 7: Tap end of flooring with hammer and tapping block to lock ends of flooring together. Remove bridge and continue towards wall until installing the final flooring in the row. BE SURE TO TAP ON EDGE OF VINYL SO AS NOT TO DAMAGE LOCKING PROFILE. Step 8: Use hammer and pull bar to lock final piece in row. Insert spacer at end of row. Continue installation to final row. Step 9: Use hammer and pull bar to lock long edges of flooring on final row. INSTALLING UNDERNEATH DOOR JAMBS: Step 1: Undercut space under door jamb to allow flooring to slide freely. Tap long edge with hammer and tapping block to lock long edge. Step 2: Use hammer and pull bar to lock this piece of flooring. COMPLETION Protect all exposed edges of the flooring by installing wall molding and/or transition strips. Make sure that no plank will be secured in any way to the subfloor.For wet areas such as bathrooms caulk the perimeter of the floor with a flexible silicone caulk.Protect the finished flooring from exposure to direct sunlight to reduce fading and thermal expansion.Cutting resilient product into a fine point may lead to delamination. Use an ethyl cyanoacrylate based glue to help fuse the resilient point together. Be sure to clean all glue from the top surface immediately. Alcohol based glues may cause resilient products to swell.Adhering tape to the surface of your resilient flooring could damage the surface. Do not use tape to secure floor protection directly to the floor during construction or renovation. Instead, adhere tape to the material used to protect the floor and secure it to the base molding along the wall. A material such as ram board can also be used to protect your flooring."},{"prompt":"recently lost my younger brother to a car accident. What is the most exhaustive list of steps you can suggest for people to avoid car accidents?","completion":"I am sorry for your loss. I don't know what to say. I would try to give my best possible answer. *First, when you buy a vehicle, Focus more on safety list-Airbags,ABS, Stability control, traction control,whichever is available in your budget and type of vehicle. *Also, check the crash rating of the vehicle,if available. More number of stars means safer. *Never drive at speeds more than the speed limit assigned by the government for different roads. *Always drive in the lane you are supposed to, depending on the country. *Be calm and focused while driving. *Don't drink and drive. *Don't talk on phone while driving. *Overake other vehicles only if you have enough space and time. *Follow all the traffic rules. *Get your vehicle serviced regularly to rectify any defects. *Weather also influences drivability. So, be extra careful in bad weather. *Use proper gear,if you are riding a bike or if you are participating in some motorsports. *Always cross the road after checking both the sides.

Back when I was working at Neiman-Marcus from 2006 to 2007- I ended up getting to know this guy who worked as a supervisor for another department. That happened while I was driving home from my job one day (after I had been an employee for that company a little more than two months)- and I accidentally hit the back of his pick-up truck while he was stopped at a red light. So after we both pulled over into the parking lot right next to us- he had me see the damage I put on his back bumper and then said that we needed the police to come out. I could definitely understand that- since this was an auto accident that involved two vehicles. The front of my car was badly smashed up- and I was lucky to later find out my insurance could just pay to have all that damage repaired. When a police car did come pulling up- two policemen got out of it and came walking over to us. Then they decided to ask him about what happened- since he was an older person and I looked really young at the time. He had them find out that he was stopped like he was supposed to be- and then I suddenly showed up ramming right into him. So that had them ask me what my reason for doing that was- and I actually told them ‘the truth’ that I apparently was going a little faster than I should have been. The cops then said that I will be written up in their report as ‘the one’ responsible for the traffic violation- and that had them give me a ticket saying I owed up to 300 to the police department. I later learned that I could have it reduced down to 100- if I was okay with having to take a session of defensive driving one Saturday (and I most certainly did when I could have that scheduled). The policemen had each talked with one of us- as one was getting his personal information and the other one was doing the same with me. The cop who was talking to me asked where I was currently employed- and I told him that I had been working at Neiman-Marcus starting that year in June. When both of the cops were done doing what they had to do- that was when the man came over to me and asked if he overheard me say I was working at where I did. After I told him ‘yes’- he then said that was where he worked and told me he did what I have already mentioned. Now to get to the actual point of this story- which had happened several months later after it was already the next year. I had later set up an account on MySpace- and was requesting people I had known during my life. Since I had already gotten a few that I was working with there at Neiman-Marcus- I looked him up on that website and sent him ‘a request’. He then sent me a PM saying that he had looked at my profile- and was going to turn down my request because he did NOT take other employees as a general rule. I told him about us having the auto accident together months earlier- and just thought that I could get to know him better on that website. He explained himself by saying that since he was a supervisor at that place- he just thought it would NOT be a good idea to get personally involved with anyone he did NOT have anything to do with outside of there. Since I was a very young person at the time- I made the mistake of sending him multiple PMs thinking I was just making conversation with somebody else. He started off just NOT replying to whatever I had sent- and then eventually did what he thought was necessary. One day I was in my department just getting my work done- and then one of my own supervisors comes approaching me. She says that the woman who is the manager in the Human Resources department needs to see me- and I go walking over into her office wondering what that is about. When I come inside- that woman is sitting at her desk looking ready to chew somebody out. So she asks me if I go on a website called MySpace- and I replied to her by saying ‘yes’. After I answered the question- she wants to know if I was the one who had been repeatedly sending PMs to that man. Then I once again tell her ‘yes’- and it was right then that she told me to take a seat. That is when she tells me about how he had come into her office earlier- and said that he wanted me to immediately stop making contact with him on the website. So she talks about how him NOT accepting the request I sent him meant something in particular- that I was NOT to be talking to him “at all”. Since I had failed to show that I understood that- he decided it was time that I get reported and am informed by someone in upper management about my wrongdoing. I was made to understand that since he was a supervisor there- he did NOT want any employees talking to him unless they were his friends that he spent personal time with. He was in charge of a different department- and there were times that he himself had to personally discuss business with the supervisors over my department. So since I was talking to him on MySpace- that had him worried that I somehow was going to cause “major conflicts” with what he had to do there at that job. I NEVER could figure out how that would be possible- but that woman did tell me I had to stop sending him PMs or else he was to let her know (and I would find myself back in her office). That made me so upset- I felt like I wanted to tell that guy right off for reporting me. I had been doing what I did when I was ‘at home and on my own time’- NOT when I was at the job and currently under the management for the company. All he had to do was let me know himself that I was NOT to do that anymore- and then just have given me his own warning telling me that I would be blocked if I sent him another PM. So I just thought there was NOTHING I could do about it as long as I was employed there- but I did later send him something on MySpace on the day that I left that place for good saying I was extremely mad at him for getting me fussed at. He did NOT reply back to me after that- and did actually block me that time so I could NOT talk to him again."},{"prompt":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?","completion":"The speed of attaining the goal."},{"prompt":"What champion is the best for the Apex Legends solo mode?","completion":"Good question, It is easiest to start with which Legends are not good to play as in the new Solo Mode. Legends NOT to use in Solos Lifeline: A great Legend if you have a squad to play with, but not so much in solos where her Passive is useless and her ultimate dangerous to use (it’s like sending up a flare). Wattson: Better than Lifeline, but still not as effective in solos as in regular Apex. Legends to Use Stick with Characters whose abilities do not rely on having other teammates. Octane, for example, is a very good Legend to play as in solos mode as all of his abilities center around his own maneuverability. Pathfinder is good as well, as is Bloodhound, Mirage, Wraith, and Bangalore. Even Gibraltor plays decent in solos with his 15% damage reduction perk and gun shield (not to mention his excellent ultimate and tactical). Caustic can be very good as well. To be honest, you can play well in solos with practically any Legend, the real difficulty is adapting your own playstyle to fit with the change in pace of the game. But if I had to pick one Legend I think is the best in Solos? I’d choose Octane. Why Octane is the Best He’s very fast. In a game mode where you will often have to juggle fighting multiple players, Octane’s high speed and small hitbox are beyond useful. His jump pad ultimate is great for reaching higher areas or outmaneuvering other players. Not to mention, his passive (Recharge health slowly) is one of the better ones. Disclaimer bit But, as I’ve said before, being good at the new solos mode in Apex Legends is (In my opinion) more about adjusting your play style than it is about choosing the right Legend. Almost all of the Legends perform really well in Solos and only a few suffer from the change in pace. Thanks for the fun question, Hope this helps!"},{"prompt":"have £5,000.

के दस नाटक प्राप्त हुए। खोज करने पर तीन और नाटक मिले। 1912 ई 0 में गणपति शास्त्री द्वारा अनंतशयन संस्कृत ग्रंथावली में भास के नाम से वे प्रकाशित किए गए। इन नाटकों की कई प्रतियाँ अन्य स्थानों से प्राप्त हुई हैं। उक्त 13 नाटकों को पूर्णत: या अंशत: भासकृत मानने / न मानने वालों के पक्ष तर्कसमर्पित होकर भी आजतक निर्णायक नहीं हो सके। इस विवाद के उठने के अनेक कारण हैं। नाटकों की स्थापना (प्रस्तावना) और पुष्पिका में कहीं भी नाटककार भास का नाम नहीं मिलता। संस्कृत ग्रंथों में भास के जो अंश उदधृत हैं उनमें अधिकांश अक्षरश: इन नाटकों में अनुपलब्ध हैं। इसी प्रकार अनेक कारण है जो उन तेरह नाटकों की भासरचना विषयक प्रामाणिकता को संदिग्ध बनाते हैं। इस प्रसंग के प्रमुख मतपक्षों को चार वर्गो में रखा जा सकता है (क) कुछ विद्वान् इन नाटकों को भासकृत मानते हैं - जैसे डॉ॰ कीथ, पुसलकर, अय्यर आदि;(ख) कुछ लोग प्रचलित नाटकों को केरल के चाक्यार नटों की कृति मानते हैं या परवर्ती किसी सामान्य नाटककार की रचना समझते हैं;(ग) दूसरे पंडितों का कथन है कि \\"प्रतिज्ञायौगंधरायणम्\\" \\"स्वप्नवासवदत्तम्\\" आदि नाटक भासकृत हैं क्योकि प्राचीन संस्कृत ग्रंथों में उनका संकेत है तथा अन्य भासकृत नहीं है;(घ) अन्य कुछ विद्वानों के मत से मूलत: वे नाटक भासकृत थे; पर उनका वर्त्तमान रूप नटों या अन्य द्वारा नाट्यप्रयोगानुकूल परिवर्तित या संक्षिप्त होकर सामने आया है। यह भी कभी कभी कहा जाता है कि भास के उपलब्ध नाटक अधूरे थे जिसे अन्य या अन्यजनों ने पूरा करके उन्हें वर्तमान रूप दिया। जो हो, यह निश्चित है क ये नाटक जाली नहीं हैं। केरल के चाकार परंपरा ने समान रूप से सुरक्षित रखा है। परंपरागत प्रसिद्धि के अनुसार उनकी संख्या 23 या 30 कही गई है। त्रिवेंद्रम् संस्करण के 13 नाटकों में कुछ ऐसी समानताएँ और विशेषताएँ हैं जिनके कारण वर्तमान संस्करण की नाट्यलेखन और नाट्यशिल्प के कलाकार की एकता सूचित होती है। \\"नांद्यंते तत: प्रविशति सूत्रधार:\\" से इनका आरंभ, प्रस्तावना के स्थान पर स्थापना शब्द का प्रयोग, नाटककार के नाम का अभाव, भरतवाक्य में प्राय: साम्य, भरत के नाट्यशास्त्रीय कुछ विधानों का अपालन, संस्कृत में कतिपय अपाणिनीय रूप का प्रयोग, अनेक नाटकों में कुछ पात्रों के नाम का साम्य, विचार और आदर्श की समानता, प्राकृत भाषा की कुछ विलक्षणता आदि ऐसी बातें हैं जिनके कारण इन सब के एककर्तृत्व का संकेत भी मिलता है। पर वह भास थे या चाक्यार नटों के नाट्यरूपंतकार, यह नहीं कहा जा सकता।

अयोध्या के पास मार्ग में स्थित देवकुल में पूर्वजों की प्रतिमायें देखते हैं , वहाँ दशरथ की प्रतिमा देखकर वे उनकी मृत्यु का अनुमान कर लेते हैं। प्रतिमा दर्शन की घटना प्रधान होने से इसका नाम प्रतिमा नाटक रखा गया है। प्रतिमा निर्माण की कथा भास की अपनी मौलिकता है। भास ने इस नाटक में मौलिकता लाने में प्रचलित रामचरित से पर्याप्त पार्थक्य ला दिया है। यद्यपि ये सारी घटनायें प्रचलित कथा से भिन्न हैं , पर नाटकीय दृष्टि से इनका महत्व सुतरां ऊँचा है और पाठक अथवा दर्शक की कौतुहल वृद्धि में ये घटनायें सहायक हुई हैं। इस नाटक में [LINKED_TEXT: रामायणीय] [URL:

प्रसंग नाटककार द्वारा गढ़ा गया है। पांचवें अंक में सुमंत्र का वन में जाना तथा लौटकर भरत से सीताहरण बताना कवि कल्पना का प्रसाद है। [LINKED_TEXT: कैकयी] [URL:

ही राज्याभिषेक इस नाटक में मौलिक ही है। प्रतिमा नाटक भास के सर्वोत्तम नाटकों में से एक है। सात अंकों के इस नाटक में भास की कला पर्याप्त ऊँचाईं को प्राप्त कर चुकी है। इस नाटक में भास ने पात्रों का चारित्रिक उत्कर्ष दिखाने का भरसक प्रयास किया है। इतिवृत्त तथा चरित्रचित्रण दोनों दृष्टियों से यह नाटक सफल हुआ है। भावों के अनुकूल भाषा तथा लघु विस्तारी वाक्य भास के नाटकों की अपनी विशेषताएँ हैं। यह

करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=5] यह भी रामकथा पर आश्रित है। इसमें छः अंक हैं। इसमें रामायण के किष्किंधाकाण्ड से युद्धकाण्ड की समाप्ति तक की कथा अर्थात् बालिवध से राम राज्याभिषेक तक की कथा वर्णित है। रामराज्याभिषेक के आधार पर ही इसका नामकरण किया गया है। कथानक को सजान संवारने में नाटककार ने पर्याप्त मौलिकता का परिचय दिया है। बालिवध को न्या ̧य रूप देने का भी नाटककार ने पर्याप्त प्रयास किया है। इस नाटक के नायक मर्यादापुरूषोत्तम श्री रामचन्द्र हैं। लोकोपदेश उनके चरित्र का प्रधान भाग है। लक्ष्मण का चरित्र इस नाटक में विशेष प्रस्फुटित नहीं हो सका है। वे श्रीराम क एक आज्ञाकारी सेवक तथा विनीत भक्त के रूप में सामने आते हैं। सुग्रीव का चरित्र इस नाटक में प्रारंभ से लेकर अन्त तक किसी न किसी रूप में वर्तमान रहता है। विभीषण न्यायप्रिय भगवद् भक्त के रूप में अंकित किया गया है। रावण क्रूर, दुराचारी तथा परस्त्री लम्पट के रूप में चित्रित किया गया है। अभिषेक नाटक के प्रणयन में भास ने पर्याप्त सफलता प्राप्त की है। यद्यपि काव्य तथा नाटकीयता की दृष्टि से यह नाटक प्रतिमा नाटक की अपेक्षा अवर कोटि का है तथापि इस नाटक की अपनी विशेषतायें हैं। राम-रावण युद्ध अपनी विशिष्टताओं में बेजोड़ है। पात्रों का कथोपकथन आकर्षक है। छोट - छोटे तथा सरल वाक्यों का विन्यास भास की अपनी विशेषता है तथा उस विशेषता का दर्शन इस नाटक में होता है। इस नाटक का प्रधान रस वीर है जो समग्र नाटक में व्याप्त है, पर करूण रस भी यत्र तत्र अनुस्यूत है। इसकी सत्ता बालिवध के अनन्तर, सीता के सन्ताप आदि में देखी जा सकती हैं। श्रृंगार का इसमें अभाव है तथा उसके लिए कहीं अवसर भी नहीं आया है। मध्यम व्यायोग[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=6] यह एक अंक का व्यायोग है। व्यायोग रुपक का एक भेद होता है। इसकी कथावस्तु का आधार महाभारत है। इसमें पाण्डवों के वनवास काल में भीम द्वारा घटोत्कच के पंजे से एक ब्राह्मण बालक की मुक्ति की कथा है। मध्यम शब्द मध्यम पाण्डव भीम और ब्राह्मण के मध्यम पुत्र दोनों के लिए प्रयुक्त हुआ है। इसलिए इस नाटक का नाम ‘‘मध्यम व्यायोग’’ है। नाटकीय दृष्टि से यह नाटक उत्तम कोटि का है, क्यों की इस परिपाक तथा भावोन्मेष में नाटककार को पूरी सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। कथोपकथनों में कहीं वैरस्य नहीं आता तथा दर्शक का कुतुहल प्रतिक्षण बढ़ता हुआ दिखाई देता है। इन कथोपकथनों में भाषा भी बड़ी सहायक सिद्ध हुई है। लम्बे समासान्त पदों का यहाँ अभाव है। भाषा सरलता में बेजोड़ है। घटनाक्रम में सत्वरता प्रभावोत्पादन में चार-चाँद लगा देती है। भास का काव्य कर्म भी इस रुपक में सफल रहा है। कर्णभार[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=7] यह भी एक अंक के कथानक वाला महाभारत की कथावस्तु से सम्बद्ध व्यायोग है। द्रोणाचार्य के परलोक सिधारे जाने पर कर्ण को सेनापति बनाया जाता है तथा युद्ध का भार उस पर आ पड़ता है, इसलिए नाटक का नाम ‘‘कर्णभार’’ है। ‘‘कर्णभार’’ शीर्षक की व्याख्या विद्वानों ने अनेक प्रकार से की है। प्रोफेसर ए डी पुसालकर की सम्मति में कानों के भारभूत कुण्डलों का दानकर यहाँ कर्ण की अद्भुत दानशीलता वर्णित की गई है। अतः कानों के आधारभूत कुण्डलों के दान को केन्द्र मानकर इस नाटक की रचना करन से इस नाटक का नाम ‘‘कर्णभार’’ है। डॉ विन्टरनित्स ने कर्णभार की व्याख्या कर्ण के कठिन कार्य से की है। डॉ॰ भट्ट की धारणा है कि कर्ण की चिन्ता ही भारस्वरूप हो गई है। इसी बात को ध्यान में रखकर इस नाटक का नाम कर्णभार रखा गया है। कुछ लोगों के मत में कर्ण द्वारा प्राप्त युद्ध कौशल उनके लिए भारभूत हो गया था, अतः इस नाटक का नाम कर्णभार पड़ा। इस नाटक में दो पात्रों का चरित्र मुख्य रूप से चित्रित है। एक है इस नाटक के नायक कर्ण और दूसरे हैं , छः ब्राह्मण वेषधारी देवराज इन्द्र। कर्ण के चरित्र की सबसे बड़ी विशेषता जो यहाँ उभर कर सामने आयी है, वह है उसकी अपूर्व ब्राह्मण निष्ठा तथा महती दानशीलता। वह ब्राह्मणों के लिए सर्वस्व दान करने के लिए तत्पर दिखाई पड़ता है। जब इन्द्र गौ, सुवर्ण आदि लेना अस्वीकार करते हैं , तब वह अपना सिर देने की बात कहता है। उसका विश्वास है कि मरने पर भी यश ही स्थिर रहता है - ’’हतेषु देहेषु गुणा धरन्ते’’। कर्ण के चरित्र की दूसरी बड़ी विशेषता है कि वह दान से किसी प्रतिफल की आशा नहीं रखता। इन्द्र के चरित्र में स्वार्थी रूप के अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई विशेषता लक्षित नहीं होती। शल्य का चरित्र कोई विशेष उभरकर सामने नहीं आया है। अपने लघु विस्तार में यह नाटक पूर्ण है। काव्यरस के परिपाक तथा नाटकीय तत्वों क निर्वाह दोनों दृष्टियों से यह नाटक उच्च कोटि का है। यद्यपि नाटक का विषय वीर रस और युद्ध भूमि से ही सम्बन्ध रखता है, पर नाटक में करुण रस की ही विशष प्रभा दिखाई पड़ती है। पंचरात्र[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=8] यह तीन अंकों का ‘‘समवकार’’ हे। इसकी कथा महाभारत के विराट पर्व पर आधारित है। इसका नामकरण स्पष्ट रूप से पॉच रात्रियों में पाण्डवों को ढूँढनें की बात से हुआ है। द्रोणाचार्य के सत्प्र यास से पाण्डव मिल जाते हैं तथा दुर्योधन द्वारा उन्हे आधा राज्य दे दिया जाता है। इस नाटक में सबसे प्रधान चरित्र दुर्योधन का चित्रित है। आरंभ से अन्त तक वह नाटक में वर्तमान है। नाटक में सर्वप्रथम एक धार्मिक राजा के रूप में उसका चरित्र सामने आया है। पाण्डवों को राज्य भ्रष्ट कर वह महान् यज्ञ का प्रवर्तन करता है। यज्ञ में सभी देश देशान्तर क राजा उसको कर देने उपस्थित होते हैं। यह उनके महान् शौर्यं पराक्रम को घोषित करता है। अवभृथ स्नान के समय दुर्योधन की अटूट गुरूभक्ति भी सामने आती है। काव्योत्कर्ष की दृष्टि से यह रुपक उत्तम कोटि का कहा जायेगा। सरल शब्दावली में भावोन्मेष भास की अपनी विशेषता है। शब्दों के आश्रय से भास ऐसा चित्र खड़ा कर देते हैं कि पूरा दृष्य ही सामने आ जाता है। अलंकारों की संघटना भी नितान्त आकर्षक है। स्थान-स्थान पर सूक्तियाँ इस बारीकी के साथ दी गई हैं कि प्रभावोत्पादन में वे दूनी वृद्धि कर देती हैं। इस रूपक का प्रधान रस वीर है। श्रृगांर का इसमें पूर्णरूपेण अभाव है, जो नाटक में स्त्रीपात्रों के न आने से हुआ है। संक्षेप में इसे भासे की नाट्यचातुरी का अनुपम उदाहरण कहा जा सकता है। उरुभंग[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=9] यह भी महाभारत की कथा पर आश्रित एक एकांकी है, इसमें व्यायोग के लक्षण घटित होते हैं। द्रा पे दी के अपमान का प्रतिशोध लेने हेतु भीम व दुर्योधन का गदायुद्ध इसमें वर्णित हुआ है। इसमें एक ही अंक है तथा समय व स्थान की अन्विति का पूर्ण रूप से पालन किया गया है। नाटक की विशिष्टता इसके दुःखान्त होने के कारण है। इस रुपक का नायक दुर्योधन है। उसके चरित्र विन्यास में नाटककार ने पर्याप्त कौशल प्रदर्शित किया है। इस एंकाकी में नाटककार ने उसके चरित्र को नितान्त उदात्त तथा प्रांजल रूप में प्रदर्शित किया है। वह शौर्य पराक्रम का जीवन्त प्रतीक है। दुर्योधन के अतिरिक्त अश्वत्थामा तथा बलराम का व्यक्तित्व भी अपने में महत्वपूर्ण है। संस्कृत नाट्य-साहित्य में उरुभंग अपना विशिष्ट स्थान रखता है। नाटकीय कौशल की दृष्टि से यह नाटकप्रशंसनीय है। कथोपकथनों में स्वाभाविकता सर्वत्र परिलक्षित होती है। समय और पात्र के अनुकूल ही वार्तालापों की संघटना की गई है। दुर्योधन के उरुभंग हो जाने पर बलराम जी की चेश्टाओं तथा कथनों में पर्याप्त स्वाभाविकता है। रस की दृष्टि से भी नाटककार को पर्याप्त सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। नाटक में करुण तथा वीर रस परस्पर अनुस्यूत हैं। इन दोनों रसों के चित्रण में लेखक को पर्याप्त सफलता मिली है। बाल चरित[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=10] इसमें पाँच अंक हैं , यह नाटक भगवान् श्री कृष्ण की बाल लीलाओं पर आधारित है। पुराणों मे य ह प्रस ग बहुचर्चित है। विशेषतः श्रीमद्भागत महापुराण का तो यही सार है। इसमें श्रीकृष्ण के जन्म से कंस वध तक की कथा वर्णित है। इसमें बाल रुपधारी भगवान् श्री कृष्ण की लीलायें व चरित्र प्रदर्शित है। अतः इस नाटक का नाम बालचरित रखा गया है। इस नाटक में नायक के रूप में भगवान् श्री कृष्ण का चरित्र वर्णित है। नाटककार इन्हें साक्षात् परात्पर ब्रह्म के रूप में चित्रित करता है। पृथ्वी के भार को दूर करने तथा गो-ब्राह्मण की रक्षा एवं असुरों के संहार के लिये उन्होंने नर रूप धारण किया है। इसमें कृष्ण का अलौकिक एवं मानवीय दोनों रूप स्पष्टतः देखेन को मिलते हैं। कृष्ण के अलावा बलराम, वसुदवे जी एवं कंस का चरित्र भी इस नाटक में चित्रित किया गया है। वासुदवे जी का चरित्र शालीनता से ओतप्रा ते है। कंस का चरित्र अत्यधिक कठोर प्रदर्शित किया गया है। नाटकीय दृष्टि से इसे एक सफल नाटक कहा जा सकता है। इसका नायक प्रख्यात तथा धीरोदात्त है। वह नायक के सभी गुणों से सम्पन्न है। इस की दृष्टि से इसमें वीर रस प्रधान है तथा करूण, रौद्र आदि रस अंग रूप में आये हैं। भाषा कथोपकथनों के अनुरूप है। सरल भाषा दर्शक के हृदय पर अपना अपूर्व प्रभाव डालती है। काव्य परिपाक की दृष्टि से यह नाटक अत्यन्तप्रशंसनीय है। अलंकारों का सुन्दर व समुचित प्रयोग किया गया है। बालचरित का निम्न श्लोक अनेक अलंकार ग्रन्थों में उल्लिखित हुआ है - लिम्पतीव तमोऽगांनि वर्षतीवान्जनं नभः। असत्पुरूष सेव वे दृष्टिर्निष्फलतां गता॥ (1/15) रात्रि के वर्णन में नाटककार को विशेष सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। शब्दों के द्वारा भावदशा के चित्रण में भास ने महान् सफलता प्राप्त की है। शब्दों के आश्रय से सम्पूर्ण भावदशा सारी परिस्थितियाँ साक्षात् दृष्टिगत होने लगती हैं। दूतवाक्य[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=11] यह भी एकांकी नाटक है। रुपक के भेदानुसार यह ‘‘व्यायोग’’ है। इसमें श्रीकृष्ण का दूत के रूप में वर्णन हुआ है। श्रीकृष्ण दुर्योधन के पास संधि का प्रस्ताव लेकर आते हैं किन्तु उनका वहाँ अपमान किया जाता है तथा वे असफल होकर लौटते हैं। वे कुद्ध होकर सुदर्शन चक्र का आह्वान करते हैं तथा उसे दुर्योधन का वध करने का आदेश देते हैं। परन्तु वह वैसा करन से रोकता है। इसकी कथावस्तु महाभारत से ली गई है। इसका नामकरण बहुत ही सटीक है। सम्पूर्ण नाटक दूतवेशधारी श्रीकृष्ण के वचनों स अनुप्रमाणित है। अतः ‘‘दूतवाक्य’’ नाम पूर्णतया सार्थक है। सम्पूर्ण नाटक वीररस से ओतप्रा ते है। श्रीकृष्ण के अस्त्रों की सहसा उद्भावना तथा विराट रूप प्रदर्शन में अद्भुत रस का चमत्कार है। प्रधान रूप से आरभटी वृत्ति की योजना है। राजनीतिक सिद्धान्तों की यह नाटक खान है। ‘‘द़ायाद्य’’ को लेकर दुर्योधन एवं श्रीकृष्ण के मध्य हुआ वार्तालाप अत्यन्त रोचक एवं सटीक है। राज्यशासन के संदर्भ में दुर्योधन का कथन अत्यन्त सारगर्भित एवं महत्वपूर्ण है। वह कहता है कि ‘‘राज्य शासन असक्तों का काम नहीं वह तो महान् बलशालियों से सिद्ध होता है - राज्यं नाम नृपात्मजैः सहृदयैर्जित्वा रिपून् भुज्यते। तल्लोके न तु याच्यते न तु पुनर्दीनाय वा दीयते॥ भास की भाषा सरल, पात्रानुकूल व रसानुरूप है। दूत घटोत्कच[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=12] यह एकांकी भी महाभारत की कथा पर आधारित है। इसमें अभिमन्यु की मृत्यु के पश्चात् श्रीकृष्ण घटोत्कच को दूत रूप में धृतराष्टं के पास भेजते हैं। दुर्योधन क्रुद्ध होकर घटोत्कच का तिरस्कार करता है। दोनों में परस्पर वाद विवाद होता है। घटोत्कच दुर्योधन को युद्ध के लिये ललकारता है। धृतराष्टं उसे शान्त करते हैं। अन्त में घटोत्कच अर्जुन द्वारा अभिमन्यु का बदला लेने की बात कहकर धमकी देते हुये निकल जाता है। घटोत्कच के दूत बनकर जाने के कारण ही इसका नाम ‘‘दूत घटोत्कच’’ रखा गया है। इस नाटक का प्रधान पात्र घटोत्कच है। वह वीर रस से ओतप्रा ते है। वीरता क साथ-साथ उसमें शालीनता तथा शिष्टता भी समभावेन दृष्टिगत होती है। वह वाक्पटु भी है। संक्षेप में हम यह कह सकते हैं कि नाटककार ने घटोत्कच का चरित्र बहुत ही उन्नत रूप में प्रस्तुत किया है। घटोत्कच के अलावा दुर्योधन, शकुनि तथा दुःशासन के चरित्र भी इस नाटक में उभरकर समाने आये हैं। ये सभी अत्यन्त अभिमानी तथा क्रूर प्रकृति के हैं। निहत्थे बालक अभिमन्यु का मारकर वे प्रसन्न होते हैं। नाटक वीर तथा करुण रस का सम्मिलन है। एक और अभिमन्यु की मृत्यु से करुण रस का वातावरण प्रस्तुत है तो दूसरी और घटोत्कच तथा दुर्योधनादि के विवाद में वीररस अपना अस्तित्व व्यक्त करता है। यह नाटक वास्तविकता के निकट प्रतीत होता है मानव हृदय की आकांक्षाओं एवं कमजोरियों के चित्रण में नाटककार अत्यन्त सफल है। इस नाटक में भरतवाक्य का अभाव है, अतः कुछ लोग इसे अपूर्ण बतलाते हैं , संभव है आगे इसमें कुछ अंश रहा हो। परन्तु यह नाटक अपने प्रयोजन में पूर्ण है। प्रतिज्ञायौगन्धरायण[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=13] यह लोककथाश्रित नाटक है। इसमें कौशाम्बी के राजा वत्सराज उदयन द्वारा उज्जयिनी के राजा प्रद्योत की पुत्री वासवदत्ता rajkumari के हरण की कथा है। इसमें चार अंक हैं। इस नाटक का नामकरण अमात्य यौगन्धरायण की प्रतिज्ञाओं पर आश्रित है। इस नाटक में अमात्य यौगन्धरायण अपने स्वामी को शत्रु के बन्दीगृह से छुड़ा लाने की प्रतिज्ञा करता है तथा अनेक विध्नों के उपस्थित होने पर भी उसे पूर्ण कर बताता है। इस नाटक का नायक वत्स देश का राजा उदयन कलाकारों का सिरमौर है। वह भरतवंशी राजा है। वह अत्यन्त रूपवान है तथा उसके रूप पर महासेन प्रद्योत की स्त्री भी मुग्ध है। वीणावादन में वह आचार्य है। उसके वीणावादन की प्रसिद्धि देश देशान्तर में व्याप्त है तथा बन्दी अवस्था में ही उसे प्रद्योतपुत्री वासवदत्ता को वीणा सिखाने का दायित्व मिलता है। अतुलित कला प्र मे होने के साथ-साथ वह शौर्य तथा पराक्रम से भी ओतप्रा ते है। कृत्रिम गज को पकड़ने का प्रयास करते समय जब प्रद्योत की सेना उस पर टूट पड़ती है, वह किंचित् मात्र भी विचलित नहीं होता तथा अनेकों को मृत्यु के घाट भेज देता है। यहाँ उसके धैर्य तथा पराक्रम की परीक्षा होती है जिसमें वह सफल होता है। जब उसे बन्दी बना लिया जाता है तो वह अपने आपको मन से बन्दी नहीं मानता तथा यौगन्धरायण द्वारा मुक्ति का पूरा प्रबन्ध कर लेने पर भी वासवदत्ता को लेकर चलने का निश्चय करता है। इस काम में वह अपने कौशल तथा यौगन्धरायण के बुद्धि कौशल से सफल होता है। उदयन के अलावा अमात्य यौगन्धरायण की भी इस नाटक में महती भूमिका है। वह बुद्धिमत्ता तथा नीतिकौशल का चूडान्त निदर्शन है। अन्य पात्रों में उज्जयिनी के राजा महासेन प्रद्योत प्रतापी राजा हैं। सर्वत्र उनके आधिपत्य का सम्मान है। वह गुणग्राहक है। मन ही मन वह वत्सराज उदयन के गुणों काप्रशंसक है। रुमण्वान तथा विदूषक दोनों स्वामिभक्त हैं। ‘प्रतिज्ञायौगन्धरायण’ भास के सफल नाटकों में अपना स्थान रखता है। कथानक का विन्यास, पात्रों का चरित्र-चित्रण, संवाद योजना एवं रसयोजना सभी का इस नाटक में सुन्दर समन्वय है। काव्यकला के परिपाक की दृष्टि से भी यह नाटक उच्चस्तरीय है। इसमें राजनीति एवं कूटनीति का साम्राज्य है। स्वामीभक्ति का महत्त्व इस नाटक में सर्वत्र लक्षित होता है। सूक्तियों का इसमें प्राचुर्य है। स्वप्नवासवदत्तम्[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=14]

प्रतिज्ञायौगन्धरायण से आगे की कथा का वर्णन है। इस नाटक का नामकरण राजा उदयन के द्वारा स्वप्न में वासवदत्ता के दर्शन पर आधारित है। स्वप्न वाला दृष्य संस्कृत नाट्य साहित्य में अपना विशेष स्थान रखता है। यह नाटक नाट्यकला की सर्वोत्तम परिणिति है। वस्तु, नेता एवं रस-तीनों ही दृष्टि स यह उत्तम कोटि का है। नाटकीय संविधान, कथोपकथन, चरित्र-चित्रण, प्राकृतिक वर्णन तथा रसों का सुन्दर सामन्जस्य इस नाटक में पूर्ण परिपाक को प्राप्त हुये हैं। मानव हृदय की सूक्ष्मातिसूक्ष्म भाव दशाओं का चित्रण इस नाटक में सर्वत्र देखा जा सकता है। नाटक का प्रधान रस शृंगार है तथा हास्य की भी सुन्दर उद्भावना हुई है। अविमारक[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=15] यह लोककथा सम्बन्धी छः अंकों का रूपक है। इसमें राजा कुन्तिभोज की पुत्री कुरंगी का राजकुमार अविमारक से प्रणय एवं विवाह का वर्णन है। नायक के आधार पर इसका नामकरण अविमारक रखा गया है। अविमारक का यथार्थ नाम विष्णुसेन था तथा अवि रूपधारी असुर को मारने से उसकी संज्ञा अविमारक है। नाटक का नायक अविमारक है। वह अतुलित पराक्रमशाली है। सहज पराक्रमशीलता तथा पर दुःखकातरता उसके स्वभाव के अंग हैं। इसी कारण वह राजकुमारी कुरंगी पर हाथी के आक्रमण करने पर उसे मुक्त करता है। अविमारक एक धीरललित नायक के रूप में इस नाटक में प्रस्तुत किये गये हैं। नाटक की नायिका कुरंगी है। वह रूपयौवन सम्पन्ना है। अन्य पात्र सौवीरराज तथा कुन्तिभोज हैं। नाटकीयता की दृष्टि से भास के अन्य नाटकों की तरह यह नाटक भी सफल है। सरल भाषा का प्रयोग नाटक की अभिनेयता में चार-चाँद लगा देता है, कथोपकथनों में स्वाभाविकता तथा भावांकन भास की अपनी विशेषता है। छोट - छोटे वाक्य, सरल भाषा, रसानुकूल एव पात्रानुकूल भाषा का प्रयोग इस नाटक को उच्चकोटि में ला खड़ा करता है। इस नाटक का प्रधान रस श्रृ गार है तथा अन्य रस उसके सहायक बनकर आये हैं। काव्यकला की दृष्टि से भी यह नाटक नितान्त उदात्त है। परिस्थितियों , अवस्थाओं एव भावों का सटीक शब्दों एवं आलंकारिक भाषा में वणर्न सर्वत्र विद्यमान है। प्रकृति चित्रण में नाटककार पूर्णतया सफल रहे हैं। नाटक में सूक्तियाँ यत्र-तत्र बिखरी हुई हैं। प्रसिद्ध सूक्ति ‘‘कन्यापितृत्वं खलु नाम कष्टम्’’ का भास ने यहाँ उत्तर उपस्थित किया है - ‘‘कन्या पितृत्व बहुवन्दनीयम्।’’ इस प्रकार सभी दृष्टियों से यह रूपक प्रषस्त कहा जा सकता है। चारुदत्त[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=16] महाकवि भास की नाट्य श्रृंखला में चारुदत्त अन्तिम कड़ी माना जाता है। इसकी कथावस्तु चार अंकों में विभाजित है। शूद्रक के प्रसिद्ध प्रकरण ‘‘मृच्छकटिक’’ का आधार यही माना जाता है। इसमें कवि ने दरिद्र चारूदत्त एवं वेश्या वसन्तसेना की प्रणय-कथा का वर्णन किया है। एक अन्य पात्र शकार है जो प्रतिनायक के रूप में है। प्र मे के आदर्श की सामाजिक प्रस्तुति इसमें दृष्टव्य है। इस नाटक का नायक वणिक्पुत्र आर्य चारूदत्त है। उसी के नाम पर इस नाटक का नामकरण हुआ है। नाटक की सम्पूर्ण घटनाएँ उसी के सुकृत्यों पर केन्द्रित हैं। चारुदत्त की दरिद्रता का बड़ा ही मार्मिक चित्रण इसमें किया गया है। चारुदत्त अत्यन्त दानी, गुणवान् एव रूपवान है। दानशीलता के कारण ही वह दरिद्र हो गया है। चारुदत्त धीर प्रकृति का मानव है। वह कला मर्मज्ञ है। वह महान् धार्मिक है तथा निर्धनावस्था में भी पूजा एवं बलिकर्म सम्पन्न करता है। नाटक की नायिका वसन्तसेना है। वह उज्जयिनी की एक प्रसिद्ध गणिका है। वह अत्यन्त रूपवती है। शकार तथा विट उसके रुप-जल के पिपासु हैं। गणिका होते हुये भी उसका चारित्रिक स्तर ऊँचा है। वह चारुदत्त के गुणों पर अनुरक्त है। उसके एक-एक गुण वसन्तसेना के प्र मे को दृढ़ करते जाते हैं। शकार से रात्रि में रक्षा और विदूषक के साथ वसन्तसेना का सकुशल घर पहुँचाना, चेट को प्रवारक देना, वसन्तसेना के न्यास की चोरी हो जाने पर उस अपने स्त्री का अत्यन्त मूल्यवान हार देना - ये सभी गुण वसन्तसेना के हृदय में स्थायी प्रभा डालते हैं तथा वह स्वयं अभिसार के लिये उसके पास चल देती है। वसन्तसेना गणिका होने पर भी धन लोभिनी नहीं है। वह अत्यन्त उदार मनवाली नायिका है। नाटक के अन्य पात्रों में चारुदत्त का मित्र मैत्र य विदूषक है। वह जन्म का ब्राह्मण है। वह अपने मित्र का विपत्ति-सम्पत्ति दोनों समयों में साथ देने वाला है। मैत्र य संस्कृत नाट्कों में अन्य विदूषकों के समान केवल भोजनभट्ट मूर्ख ब्राह्मण नहीं है। वह समयानुसार उसके हित सम्पादन के लिए कठिन कार्यों को भी सम्पन्न करता है। शकार इस नाटक में खलनायक है। वह मूर्ख है। सामान्य से सामान्य बात का भी उस ज्ञान नहीं है। गुणवानों के प्रति उसका कोई आकर्षण नहीं है। वह वसन्तसेना के रूप पर मुग्ध है तथा बलात् उससे प्र मे करना चाहता है। यह नाटक दैव-दुर्विपाकवश अकस्मात् समाप्त हो जाता है तथा यह सहज में अनुमित हो जाता है कि अपने वर्तमान रूप में यह पूर्ण नहीं है। यह भी संभावना है कि इस नाटक की रचना करते समय भास की मृत्यु हो गई हो तथा इस प्रकार यह अधूरा रह गया हो। यह नाटक सरल व सुबोध है। चरित्र-चित्रण की दृष्टि से बेजोड़ है। नाना प्रकार क सज्जन से सज्जन तथा दुर्जन से दुर्जन यहाँ वर्तमान हैं। एक ओर चारुदत्त सज्जनता की सीमा है तो दूसरी ओर शकार दुर्जनता का चूडान्त प्रतीक है, कथोपकथन की दृष्टि से भी यह नाटक उच्च कोटि का है। इस नाटक में भास का कविहृदय भी पूर्णरूप से अभिव्यक्ति को प्राप्त हुआ है। प्रकृति का चित्रण भी स्वाभाविक एवं हृदयाकर्षक है। नाटक का प्रधान रस श्रृंगार है तथा अन्य रसों का भी समयानुसार सुन्दर प्रयोग किया गया है। इस नाटक में देशकाल का चित्रण बड़ा ही स्वाभाविक है। द्यूत का वर्णन दृष्टव्य है। दास-प्रथा का संकेत सज्जलक द्वारा वसन्तसेना की चोरी को मुक्त कराने के उद्योग से लगता है। चोरी का दृष्टान्त सज्जलक का कृत्य है। नाटक की भाषा सरल, सरस एवं पात्रानुकूल है। नाटकों का रचनाकाल[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=17] भास और उनके नाटकों का अविर्भाव

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"I’m sorry to know that your family wants to have your cat killed rather than investigate what’s going on with her. If you’d been throwing up and/or had diarrhea, they would know that something was wrong and probably take you to the doctor. They may not value your cat’s life, which is sad. These behaviors are symptoms of a hidden issue. Some possibilities have been noted in the answers: Stress from something or someone new in the house. Routine changes can be upsetting to cats. Stress between humans can cause stress in a cat.Urinary tract infection, which is painful, as you may know. It’s difficult to know the cause of this, but a diet of dry food, lack of fresh water, dirty litter box can be contributing factors. The vet will give pain medicine, usually liquid Bubprenorphine, and anti-biotics like Clavamox. A urinalysis may reveal crystals, which are sharp and painful when the cat urinates.Digestive issues, which can be caused by food allergies or swallowing too much fur. Long haired cats need to be brush and combed daily so they don’t ingest so much fur when grooming. A “de-shedding” tool can be very helpful. I don’t know where you live, but they can be ordered online. I have several different ones, but my favorite is the “Shed Monster” that I bought at Walmart for 7. It works better for my cat than the 40 Furminator. Another one I like is made by Sargeant, and has two sets of teeth that are easily flipped from one to the other. One is like a large tooth comb and the other is more like flea comb teeth which gets the loose undercoat fur. I use the large tooth end first to check for mats. The cost to euthanize your cat by a vet would cost about the same or close to an exam and urinalysis. Most reputable vets won’t euthanize a healthy cat. Although your cat is not healthy, her issues are treatable. If your family won’t support you in helping her, then the best thing to do is surrender her to a no-kill shelter. She has a good chance of being treated, and put up for adoption by someone who knows how to care for cats. My own cat has recently shown that she had a UTI because she started peeing outside her box, and making lots of unsuccessful attempts to pee in the box. She also cried. I took her to the vet after I observed this for a day. The urinalysis showed crystals, which surprised me because I give her commercial raw cat food along with some high quality dry at night. I also mix in a little D-Mannose, which is a preventative for bacterial infections in the urethra. I didn’t get her urine cultured to see if it was bacterial, because of the extra cost. She got anti-biotics (just in case) and pain medicine. That was about a week ago, and I can see that she’s back to normal. I took away the dry food for awhile, and gave her only raw meat. (thin slices of beef and chicken) The urine needs to be on the acid side in cats, and raw meat is helpful. I don’t know if she still has crystals, and I’m researching ways to dissolve them, even though she’s not straining in the box anymore. I’ve been under extreme stress, and cats are sensitive to this, so she may have picked up on this. Stress in humans or animals can cause health issues. So, de-stressing is a very critical element in treatment. Please let me know your response to this, and your next steps. It’s hard to love your kitty, and be unable to do what’s needed. I feel for you, and hope this answer helps."},{"prompt":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","completion":"I don’t know, probably “Dying Inside,” by Robert Silverberg.

No, you can’t do this. You’ve been given some reasons in other answers. I’ll elaborate on one additional one. In order to equate one quantity with another, the two must have the same dimensions. Charge difference would have the dimension of charge. the correpsonding SI base units would be ampere-seconds. The dimensions for potential difference correpsond to SI base units of kilogram-meter[math]^2[/math] per Ampere-seconds[math]^3[/math], which is the volt. Coulonb’s law for the force between two charges, from which the equation for potential difference can be obtained, has a constant in it, as do most such laws, such as the law of universal gravitation. Aside from making sure that the answer comes out numerically correct, these constants also are responsible for converting units from, in this case, charge and distance to potential difference. If you are unfamiliar with dimensional analysis, you should become so because it is a useful tool for detecting mistakes. If you start off with some dimenstions such as charge and distance and wish to calculate potential difference, and at the end of the calculation you answer does not have the dimensions appropriate for potential difference, then your answer is wrong. If the dimensions are correct, it still does not mean that your answer is right; for instance, you might have omitted a dimensionless constant such as [math] pi [/math] or [math] sqrt{2}[/math] but at least you have some assurance that you are on the right track. 12–31–2020"},{"prompt":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","completion":"The tallest mountain in the solar system.

I’m probably still considered ‘overweight;’ but my life has vastly improved nonetheless. There is probably nothing more socially debilitating than being morbidly obese. Not being able to fit into a standard chair was one of the most humiliating aspects of social interaction for me. From those office chairs with arms to those unforgiving football stadium seats, chairs became a big issue for me. I remember being at some outdoor event where the choice was sitting in a standard lawn chair, standing or sitting on the ground. Standing for a long time was painful on my back, so sitting on the ground while there were available lawn chairs became an embarrassing thing to explain to all those normal-sized people who INSISTED I sit in a lawn chair. No, folks, I’d never be able to get OUT of it, thanks. I’d have to wear it home…you know? The physical limitations for me were daunting. Having no endurance for simple tasks like stair climbing or shopping was not only physically terrible, but took a mental/emotional toll as well. Not being able to sit on the floor in a kneeling position (as it was too painful) was frustrating. Knowing if I actually got down all the way to SIT on the floor made me soon realize I’d have a terrible time trying to get up off the floor again. Normal things like this that most people never have to think about, until maybe they are elderly.

Outside of even that, both Kakashi and Guy get immensely more powerful through the course of the 4th War to the point they could easily challenge all of the Akatsuki by themselves. Pretty much everyone below Obito would get outright blitzed by either of them including Pain & Itachi. Sage Mode Naruto could percieve Pain's movements and I'd argue was half a breath faster at CQC, while Itachi is outright stated to be less powerful than Pain (talking about Sick Itachi). Kakashi easily blitzed numerous jinchuriki comparable to KCM1 Naruto in speed & Guy's movements in 7th Gate were beyond anything Gaara percieved prior to his fight with Jūbidara, including those of lightened V2 Ay & Edo Madara. Deidara can fly but even with that, nothing's protecting him from getting vaporised by the residual force of one single hirudora, which easily has more AoE than any aerial height he can fly up to. Said Hirudora also plows through all three hundred of Sasori's puppets, stomps a mudhole through Hidan & blows up whatever Susano'o Itachi manages to conjure up (if he can do it in time, which he can't). Meanwhile, Kakashi casually blitzes Kakuzu with one lightning blade, literally smashes through every Path of Pain, decapitates Kisame & probably burns all of Konan with a single fire jutsu. A fully powered Catastrophic Shinra Tensei (the Konoha busting kind) will not even tickle Kakashi's mud walls, which can tank Uchiha Madara level fire release (who could pull off higher AP than the CST with BARE PUNCHES) and a Chibaku Tensei core will just get warped in a microsecond by Kamui (if Guy can't just blow it up alone). The ONLY people remotely relevant to this topic at all are Edo Nagato, Edo Itachi & War Mask Obito. Nagato is the weakest of those three, but still comfortably above KCM1 Naruto level. Then again, so is Kakashi/Guy and they have better feats than just being “vaguely” above KCM1 Naruto. Nagato has a better arsenal, but he's also stated to have shit mobility & actually needs to summon beasts to reliably react to Kakashi or Guy. In his white haired form, his durability is low enough that he can just about be one shotted by a lone hirduora blast (furthermore because he can't absorb it). If we're allowing him his full healthy state (which he has to absorb chakra to get to), he has a shot but he still can't beat Kakashi & Guy working together especially if you consider Late War Kakashi being able to react on par with and move at relative pace to KCM Minato who in turn scales above EMS Sasuke who's above Edo Itachi who's blatantly blitzed Nagato on panel twice in broad daylight with Nagato being amped up by his summons. For that last point I'd say Kakashi can take out Edo Itachi as well. His speed scaling is pretty much better & he could already draw counters to all of Itachi's genjutsu by the begining of Shippuden & stated Itachi wouldn't be able to catch him a second time. Even if Itachi could trap him in Tsukuyomi there is no real evidence he could do it before Kakashi places a Kamui warp off his head & IMO it's biased to suggest Tsukuyomi would land faster than Kamui if both go at it at the same time (especially since both scale to the speed of the user's perception and Kakashi's perception is higher than Itachi's). Using something like Boruto Era Kakashi is even more blatant mismatch considering he's hilariously more powerful than his War self. The only opponent I would say both lose to is War Mask Obito considering he alone would be able to summon seven powerful Jinchuriki & his own Kamui has been shown phasing through Kakashi's speed. Even then by the end of the War Kakashi could react and throw a KUNAI faster than Jūbimadara could throw a TSO at his direction, with the latter being fast enough to completely shut off Obito's attempts to phase into Kamui altogether. That and he could already physically contend with him, nearly kill him with one Raikiri, etc etc. Guy and Kakashi would lose at this point with the sheer numbers but that too with extreme difficulty but in all honesty, Boruto Era Kakashi is so absurdly powerful he can probably pull it off on his own. He's atleast a blitz tier faster than everyone else and even with lacking hax, should still be able to pull off war arc+ levels of firepower."},{"prompt":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","completion":"There are many natural remedies that can help relieve lower back pain. I have included some of them try to enjoy an anti-inflammatory drink every day when you consume anti-inflammatory foods regularly, several antioxidant anti-inflammatory and even anti-cancer agents can build up in your blood. Over a period of time these potent agents can play a significant role in reducing and or eliminating inflammatory reactions in the body. Try consuming these healthy drinks on a regular basis may help reduce your back pain. Some examples of anti-inflammatory drinks include turmeric milk, tart cherry juice, and ginger-green tea. Fall asleep faster and sleep longer when you have a restful night’s sleep your back will then feel less sore during the day. Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night. Avoid prolonged static posture. Sitting or standing for long periods of time can cause your muscles to become strained and fatigued. To avoid this, try to change positions frequently throughout the day. Use ice and or heat therapy Ice packs this can help reduce inflammation and numb soreness while heat therapy can help relax muscles and improve blood flow. Stretch your hamstrings twice daily. Tight hamstrings increase stress across the lower back and can cause back pain. To stretch your hamstrings, lie on your back with both knees bent and place a rolled-up towel under the ball of one foot. Straighten your knee and slowly pull back on the towel until a stretch is felt in the back of your thigh. You can try acupuncture. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical practice that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. It has been shown to be effective in treating chronic back pain. Practice yoga regularly. Yoga is an excellent way to prevent and relieve back pain because it strengthens your core muscles which support your spine If you have severe or persistent back pain, it’s important to see a doctor.

However, it's always a good idea to do a patch test before using it on your entire face to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction or irritation. Leaving aloe vera gel on your face overnight can help to hydrate and soothe your skin, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. Aloe vera gel is known for its moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and irritation. If you decide to leave aloe vera gel on your face overnight, it's important to make sure you're using a pure, high-quality product that doesn't contain any added ingredients that could irritate your skin. You may also want to cover your pillow with a towel or use an old pillowcase, as the gel can sometimes transfer onto your bedding. Overall, using aloe vera gel on your face overnight can be a safe and effective way to improve your skin's hydration and overall appearance, but as with any skincare product, it's important to listen to your body and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions. Additionally, it's important to note that aloe vera gel is not a substitute for a comprehensive skincare routine. While it can help to soothe and hydrate your skin, it's important to also cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize your skin regularly to maintain its health and appearance. If you have any concerns about using aloe vera gel on your face, or if you have a pre-existing skin condition, it's a good idea to consult with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional before using it. They can provide guidance on the best skincare routine for your individual needs and help you avoid any potential risks or complications. In summary, using aloe vera gel on your face overnight can be a safe and effective way to moisturize and soothe your skin, but it's important to use a pure, high-quality product and to listen to your body and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions."},{"prompt":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","completion":"To pick a best [LINKED_TEXT: Mobile App Development Company in Chicago] [URL: https://bit.ly/2g8LFTx] from various is not a simple task.

According to [LINKED_TEXT: Whole Foods Market's average store size worldwide, 2016 | Statistic] [URL: https://www.statista.com/statistics/258684/whole-foods-markets-average-store-size-worldwide/], the average store is 39,000 square feet of floor space. Assuming a person started by eating or preserving the most perishable foods first (salting and pickling meats and veggies, drying out some fruits, maybe even making jerky if the deli ovens are working the first day), there should be hundreds of pounds of meats, and several hundred pounds of produce. Dairy would be a problem. If the power stayed on, you’d have milk for 3 weeks, and yogurt for a couple months. It’s probably best to put as much in the freezers as possible. If power is off, you’ve got milk for 5 days and yogurt for a couple weeks.

Your diet would probably be very protein heavy the first few months, and more fats and carbs after that ( a shelf full of vegetable oil keeps a long time, and can provide hundreds of thousands of calories).

How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies including Google have been trying to do it for years?","completion":"They are quite different. Google's system uses an expensive 64-beam LIDAR to localize itself to within 10cm on a detailed pre-existing map. It's incredibly precise. It also uses the LIDAR data to build a 360 degree world model that tracks and predicts movements for all nearby vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles, so it's able to plan intelligent paths through complex highway or urban environments. Tesla's system is reportedly based on monocular forward-looking camera technology from Mobileye. This means it's very unlikely that Tesla's system can localize itself on a map, at least to the degree needed to accomplish lane keeping (GPS isn't reliable enough). However, the forward-looking camera can pick up the location and curvature of highway lane makers, which is more than enough to simply keep the car in its lane and accomplish basic lane change maneuvers. Each of these systems excels in its own domain. Tesla's is low-cost and will likely be effective at accomplishing Elon Musk's goal of automating 90% of driving within a few years. But handling the last 10% of driving situations is very, very hard. Google created the 90% solution years ago and accurately predicted others would follow soon after, so they decided to focus on solving the really hard problems that will give them a major, potentially even monopolistic advantage in the long run."},{"prompt":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Homemade Healthy and delicious Smoothie for every human disease extracted from The Ayurveda: Ayurvedic Super SmoothieHomemade Healthy and delicious Smoothie for every human disease extracted from The Ayurveda: Ayurvedic Super Smoothie eBook : Bhattacharya, Sukanta: Amazon.in: Kindle Storehttps://www.amazon.in/Homemade-delicious-Smoothie-extracted-Ayurveda-ebook/dp/B0BX4KFYC7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14Z3XNGC4FSN7&keywords=Homemade+Healthy+and+delicious+Smoothie+for+every+human+disease+extracted+from+The+Ayurveda&qid=1677750687&sprefix=homemade+healthy+and+delicious+smoothie+for+every+human+disease+extracted+from+the+ayurveda%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1] [URL: https://www.amazon.in/Homemade-delicious-Smoothie-extracted-Ayurveda-ebook/dp/B0BX4KFYC7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14Z3XNGC4FSN7&keywords=Homemade%20Healthy%20and%20delicious%20Smoothie%20for%20every%20human%20disease%20extracted%20from%20The%20Ayurveda&qid=1677750687&sprefix=homemade%20healthy%20and%20delicious%20smoothie%20for%20every%20human%20disease%20extracted%20from%20the%20ayurveda%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1]"},{"prompt":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","completion":"There are a few tricks that will help you get lower prices at hotels"},{"prompt":"w do I create a text file list of the contents of a folder?","completion":"Use the find utility on unix.

One of the best ways to make a good impression on a date is to be a good listener. Pay attention to what your date is saying and ask follow-up questions. This shows that you're interested in what they have to say and that you're engaged in the conversation.Be respectful. Always be respectful of your date, even if you don't end up hitting it off. This means being polite, and considerate, and avoiding any behavior that could be seen as offensive or disrespectful.Have fun! A first date should be fun, so try to relax and enjoy yourself. If you're having fun, your date will likely have fun too. Here are some additional tips: Plan a date that is appropriate for the time of day and the weather. If it's a hot day, avoid going to a restaurant where you'll be sweating and uncomfortable. Instead, go for a walk in the park or have a picnic.Choose a location that is convenient for both of you. If you live in different parts of town, choose a location that is halfway between you. This will make it easier for both of you to get there.Dress appropriately. You don't need to go overboard, but you should dress in a way that makes you feel confident and comfortable.Arrive on time. Punctuality is important, so make sure you arrive on time for your date.Be prepared for anything. Things don't always go according to plan, so it's a good idea to be prepared for anything.

If bullets were sharp it would increase their penetrating power, but their energy would be released into the target over a larger period of time. This is also one of the reasons why we use lead bullets that deform on impact."},{"prompt":"w do new owners of big 35 foot or longer class A motorhomes go from driving an everyday car or pickup truck to driving such a giant vehicle?","completion":"In the UK the vehicle regulations state that any motorhome (of any size) is tested for fitness as a “motor caravan” which is the same class as a car. It does not matter what size it is its road worthiness is tested as a car. The difference comes when you wish to drive it. A motorhome that weighs over 3500 Kgs is classed as a heavy vehicle, and must be driven on a LGV (Large Goods Vehicle) licence. This is the same licence you need to drive a truck. The Government realises it takes greater skills to drive a large vehicle so a car licence is no good. You must display a degree of awareness and consideration of its size, so a goods vehicle licence is the licence required."},{"prompt":"Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time?

If you want to change the volume you adjust the output from the pre-amp and then the amplifier just does its thing. CO2 is the control knob, even if H2O is doing the heavy lifting. CO2 levels determine the initial amount of heating, which then gets amplified by H2O. More heat due to added CO2 puts more H2O in the air, which traps more heat, etc. until a new (higher) equilbirium level is reached. The amplification doesn’t become runaway because the amount of heat being radiated increases as the fourth power of the temperature, and that acts as a strong brake on temperature increases. We can’t control H2O levels directly, because they will very quickly revert to the current equilibrium value, either by increasing evaporation to add H2O if the level is below equilibrium or by condensation to remove H2O if it’s above equilibrium. But we can affect CO2 levels and thus add direct heating from the CO2, plus additional heating from the newly raised equilibrium level for H2O. And people tend to focus on the things they can control."},{"prompt":"Sometimes when I'm on a WhatsApp call, the app suddenly says call on hold.

I see painful sycophantic weakness in journalism in the US. For example, to see the press briefings from the White House and no one stands up to the orange buffoon, no one punches to the facts and truth. It’s sickening to watch the bottom lickers being cowards and not doing their job. Trump sends people out? So all leave and report why … brt no, they are too scared to stand up and fight and tell the public what’s happening. In the US it’s about brainwashing and dumbing down and being afraid. That’s NOT journalism. That’s being afraid to stand out and do a job that should be reporting the truth. We in the UK make mistakes in journalism, we have had horrific instances of phone tapping for example. Our press can be totally intrusive and annoying and they print lies too. I am not defending this practice by any means but there has to be a happy medium and being a bottom licker isn’t journalism. NOT reporting the truth about Trump and his regime (for example), isn’t journalism. Being tied to your job by advertising is NOT journalism."},{"prompt":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","completion":"However, Ayurveda takes a holistic approach to health, which means it considers a person's overall health and well-being, rather than just addressing specific symptoms. Therefore, an Ayurvedic practitioner may recommend a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes, along with specific Ayurvedic herbs and medicines, to help manage diabetes in a healthy way. Some common Ayurvedic herbs that are known to aid in diabetes management include: Bitter melon: It is a vegetable that is known to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.Gymnema Sylvestre: It is a herb that is known to improve insulin secretion and help lower blood sugar levels.Cinnamon: It is a spice that is known to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels.Fenugreek: It is a seed that is known to improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels.Amla: It is a fruit that is known to help regulate blood sugar levels and improve overall health. It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for managing diabetes. A qualified Ayurvedic practitioner can assess your individual needs and recommend a personalized plan that suits your body type, health conditions, and lifestyle. Additionally, it's important to combine any Ayurvedic remedies with a healthy diet and regular exercise for optimal results. It's also important to continue taking any prescribed medications or insulin as directed by a licensed medical professional."},{"prompt":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","completion":"I used to work with some of the most known software but none of them seemed to pay off. I think that the biggest problem they had was that the data was not accurate. I booked a free trial with ZoomInfo and I have to say I was rather disappointed by them. The platform didn’t rise to my expectation. The database was inaccurate A few months after that, a former colleague of mine recommended me Voogy and I booked a demo. The platform opened so many possibilities. I was able to narrow down by my ICP and get accurate data based on my Buyer Persona. The developers installed a feature that enables you to predefine the Buyer Persona from the very beginning. The bounce-back guarantee was another touch that I liked because it allowed me to prospect more in case of the inaccurate data. The feature that I consider a game changer is the Auto Prospector. Basically, it does all the work for me: it prospects by my ICP and by Buyer Persona and engages with them through an inbuilt sequence engine. From 4 hours that I used for prospecting to 40 minutes a day, this platform gives me more time to focus on closing close deals."},{"prompt":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","completion":"As a resident of Manhattan, I have been familiar with Donald Trump for over 40 years. In 1979 I worked for two weeks as a management trainee for the new Grand Hyatt Hotel which was an overhaul of the derelict Commodore Hotel at 42nd St. This was a Trump project although he was a nobody compared to the other big-shots involved. I was supposed to work for free while I was in training. After my first week I was told that I was being promoted to a more advanced program where I was expected to work another week without salary. After another week I caught on that I was being scammed and took another job. I remember that the the Grand Hyatt project did not do well and there was a big lawsuit between Trump and the City over a tax dispute. Over the next few decades I watched as Trump performed his antics. At first, I found him mildly entertaining but my disgust grew as his virulent racism and bigotry became more and more obvious. Occasionally, during the ‘90s I would hear him saying crude, vulgar things on the Howard Stern Show, a place for crude, vulgar things. I vividly remember his vicious racial attacks on the Central Park Five which continued long after they were exonerated by DNA evidence. I avoided “The Apprentice” since I have no stomach for “reality TV.” Everything I observed about him disgusted me especially his treatment of women and minorities. His pursuit of “birtherism” was the final straw. I often said, “If this guy ever gets in the White House it will be the end of our democracy, if it doesn’t get us all killed first.” Looks like I was right. I believe we will someday discover his financial empire was a fraud and that he is financially controlled by Russian oligarchs."},{"prompt":"What comes after video game graphics get as realistic as possible?","completion":"What comes after video game graphics get as realistic as possible? I guess we could try upping the sizes of game worlds. Graphically speaking I think we are hitting a plateau. You can’t make a game world look much better then Red Dead Redemption 2. So I would move my eyes to making the world bigger so as to allow more things to do. Maybe you implement a random quest system that makes people run up to you asking for aid in a task. This makes it so even after beating the game you always have a job to do or a base/camp to clear out. In games with trains have them be drivable. I hate seeing a train and not be able to take over and ride the tracks. The same goes for planes. If you have them I should be allowed to take them and use them."},{"prompt":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","completion":"It’s never the size that counts, it’s the workmanship. Infinity is akin to never-ending time and space. As we live through time, time ages us to death. Imagine becoming immortal! Read on! Dr. Gerhauser discovered a fountain of youth, how to turn 90 years old into 30 years old defying time. He says when the Mitochondria inside our bodies die we age—they are our power energy source.

The brain is thought to contain memories, it's thought to create your sense of self and it's thought to create your personality (and well… thoughts). With those things gone, what is left of 'you'? Even if there's some ever-pervading awareness, that isn't exactly 'you', it's more like the quality of experience which experienced what it was like to be 'you'. My view is this: There's not a good argument against after life, but there's a good argument against an afterlife for 'you'."},{"prompt":"Can I let my pet rat go into the wild?","completion":"I don't know.

I think the civil war yielded the slaves a far better deal than if they would have received if economic forces were the determining factors like the high cost to keep them or obsolescence do to advances in technology.

So yeah , I saw the picture a day before and all I could say is that it touched my heart❤️. I’m not a fan of love stories, I rarely watch them, but Dil Bechara proved to be an exception, just because it was the last of legacy of our own “Apna Hero” Sushant Singh Rajput. So , when I was watching this movie , during the last 30 minutes I cried so hard that I almost choked . And I am not exaggerating . I literally found it difficult to breathe . I don't know the fact that Sushant is really no more made the death seem realistic . His smile 💔 The story is set in Jamshedpur and revolves around Kizie and Manny, two individuals with contrasting personalities who have a really unfortunate common trait- cancer. Adapted from John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars, the movie doesn’t come up with any surprise in terms of plot and the story. Manny and Kizie’s battle with cancer and their subsequent struggles to just make their lives feel normal hits at an emotional level as to how we tend to take this life for granted and seldom appreciate the normal in our lives. This may sound like an overstatement, but Dil Bechara is a movie for our generation which is so lost and broken in the pursuit of future, that it has forgot to enjoy the present. Immanuel Rajkumar Jr. aka Manny aka Apna Hero SSR, a Rajinikanth fan and a Bollywood buff believes that life is a gift and must be lived to the fullest, pretty much evident from his dialogue- “जन्म कब लेना है और मरना कब है, ये हम डिसाइड नहीं करते. पर जीना कैसे है, वो हम डिसाइड कर सकते हैं.” Having seen him in Kai Po Che , MSD, Sonchiriya and Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! I won’t say this was Sushant’s best performance till date, but there was something different about this one. Earlier, upon seeing him giving excellent performances, the mind always said, “This guy, who represents all of us small town kids, all of us who chose a safe profession but were hustlers in our mind, will go miles ahead and be what he always dreamed to be.” While watching Dil Bechara, this feeling was replaced by the realization that this will be the last of him, the last of his legacy, the last of our own hero, who had his head held high in the sky with his feet firmly grounded. Dil Bechara may not be the last or the best love story I ever come across, but it will always bear a special place in my heart, such was the impact of the movie and the actors. A few takeaways from the movie I wanted to share- Live in the present, enjoy every moment. Life is too unpredictable to be taken for granted Appreciate the normal in your life, what’s natural to you is a dream for somebody If your brain tells you it’s silly to do something, it probably is, but if that silly something makes you feel wonderful and changes your life for good, go ahead and do it You live in the people who love you, even after you’re long gone. Make them your priority, you’ll never regret it! I would give Dil Bechara a 10/10 because taking out even one point would be an injustice . If you get time , do watch this movie . At last a quote on life ( it's by me : no this isn't flaunting ) If I ever die and get a choice to go to heaven or be a ghost and return back , I'll chose the later . Why? Because I left my heaven behind when I died Thank you ❤️"},{"prompt":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","completion":"Some of my favourite jokes troll bassists.

Bordered by the Lakes and Volcanoes District to the North, Argentina to the east, Southern Patagonia to the South and the Pacific Ocean to the west, Northern Patagonia can be reached in a number of ways, the most common being through the Balmaceda airport, served by flights from Santiago. Other options include driving along the Carretera Austral, parts of which are connected by ferries, or taking the small plane that flies from Puerto Montt. This enchanting and wild area, generously endowed with native forests, millennia-old glaciers, and outstanding adventures, awaits visitors all year round, although the weather is best between October and April. 2- Kamchatka // Russia There are few places in the world that can enthral quite like Kamchatka, easily Russia's most scenically dramatic region. A vast volcanic peninsula that is almost entirely wilderness, Kamchatka is a place of extraordinary primal beauty, rushing rivers, hot springs and snow-capped peaks. Getting here takes time and effort, and exploring the region even more so, but few visitors leave anything other than awestruck. Visitors to Kamchatka have traditionally been an intriguing mix of outdoorsy types and package tourists, both with deep pockets. Yet against all odds, Kamchatka has recently become viable for independent, relatively budget-conscious travellers. The capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, may be gritty, but it enjoys an incredible setting and has its share of easily accessible activities, including lift skiing into late May and some very doable volcano climbs. Kamchatka may not be a budget destination yet, but no longer is it strictly the domain of tycoons. 3 - Northern Forest Complex // Myanmar Spanning more than 12,000 square miles at the crossroads of India, Myanmar, and China, this vast landscape encompasses the highest mountain and the headwaters of the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin, the country’s most important river system, sustaining extensive rice farming that supports many local communities. Four protected areas embrace one of the region’s largest remaining expanses of natural forest, which host some of the region's greatest biodiversity, including what are believed to be its best remaining populations of tigers and elephants. These forests are also home to more than a million people who depend on the region's vast ecological resources, both inland and along the adjacent coastline. 4 - Southern Namibia The Namib is estimated to be the world’s oldest desert, and it’s one of the driest, least-populated places in the world.

Beyond this point, we’ve got a bunch of ideas as to what could be there to solve various open questions in physics; too many ideas, one might say. The open problems indicate that there’s something else out there, so we’re looking for anything that differs from what we expect. We do this by searching a bunch of different routes simultaneously. The [LINKED_TEXT: 750 GeV diphoton excess] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/750_GeV_diphoton_excess] and the recent discussion of [LINKED_TEXT: A Violation of Lepton Universality] [URL: https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/01/a-violation-of-lepton-universality/] are two examples of what we’re looking for - ideas that surprise us, either through evidence for a new kind of particle (the former) or some deviation from the laws we expect (the latter). Generally, the former would be called the energy frontier (we need more energy for higher-mass particles), and the latter would be called the precision frontier (precisely measuring particle properties). Some of the more interesting ideas include modifications of Higgs physics and new kinds of Higgs bosons that are heavier than the Standard Model Higgs, or strange decays for known particles. For instance, if the Higgs could decay into dark matter, then we would observe fewer Higgs bosons than we expect. There’s also interest in looking at heavier composite particles (particles made from the heavier quarks) and studying their properties, to add to our understanding of QCD, but I know significantly less about that."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Ecclesiasticus 18:6“As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.” Everything that God created is perfect in their creation.Nothing can be added to them in order to improve them, and the depth of God’s knowledge cannot be found out. Romans 10:3“For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” Man has used the wisdom of God to establish their own vanities upon Earth, and refused to submit to the True wisdom, knowledge, and understanding that leads to immortality. God’s work is perfect, and man has sinned against Him.Man cannot begin to fathom the depth of God’s precision. Hebrews 4:13“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” God is the Supreme Intelligent Being who has telepathy. Wisdom of Solomon 2:23“For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.” God made mankind in His immortal image. Wisdom of Solomon 2:24“Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.” It was through the rebellious counsel against His laws that man turned away because of the pride of their wicked heart. As a result, the generations of mankind are cursed with mortality until the Day of Redemption. Psalms 37:9“For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.” This life has many trials and is full of trouble.We must learn what Righteousness is and apply it to our life in order to receive salvation (preservation from physical and moral harm). Ecclesiasticus 17:1“The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into it again.” We are formed from the rich thick dark mud of the Earth.This is why we are called terrestrial beings.Terra meaning of the Earth. Ecclesiasticus 17:2“He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also over the things therein.” Our days are short and full of labor, but God has given us power to manipulate the things that are within the atmosphere of Earth. Hosea 4:7“As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.” The more we increased in numbers and knowledge, the more mankind’s heart turned wicked and rebelled against God. Judgment is coming upon the Earth to recompense the Evil, but gross darkness must cover the Earth first. Ecclesiasticus 17:3“He endued them with strength by themselves, and made them according to his image,” Mankind is made in the Image of God. We have been given power like the Most High, but on a weaker scale of ability. Ecclesiasticus 17:4“And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls.” Nature has been appointed naturally to do service unto man.The creations on Earth are under our authority, to do with them as we choose. Thus some people seek to save the creation, and so desire to destroy it. Ecclesiasticus 17:5“They received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.” Man has been given 5 senses to perceive the world around them with.Those 5 senses are Sight, Touch, Taste, Hearing, and Smell. In the 6th part God gave us a brain to contemplate what we perceive through our 5 senses, and in the 7th part a mouth and tongue for speech. Speech enables us to articulate the internal thoughts of our heart (mind). Ecclesiasticus 18:6“As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.” Nothing God created is imperfect, and the depth of knowledge concerning how God made everything is incapable of being found out. The natural body of man was created in the image of God, a perfect masterpiece weaved with the fingertips of God. If we want to know the deep and hidden mysteries concerning our soul and the world around us, we only need to open up the Book and Read. Without Truth we can do nothing of ourselves. John 14:6“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” Without Christ we cannot direct our way in Truth to live forever, and we all know that we must die one day. 2 Corinthians 5:10“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” It is called idolatry. Romans 13:1“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.” God is a Higher Power.He established the order that brought forth the ordinances we are subject to today. Genesis 1:1“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” God created Heaven and Earth. 2 Chronicles 20:6“And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?” The MOST HIGH Power of our forefathers, from ancient times past until now, is the Power in Heaven that rules over all of the kingdoms of man. None can withstand His power. 2 Chronicles 6:1“Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.” His throne is in the thick darkness of outer space, where people see UFOs. 1 Kings 22:19“And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.” His throne is in Heaven above, and He has an army of Spirits awaiting His command. Ecclesiasticus 43:9“The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.” The moon is the beauty of heaven, and glory of the stars, that gives light upon the Earth during the night. Ecclesiasticus 43:10“At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches.” The stars are spiritual beings that stand in their watches, meant to assist us. Psalms 104:3“Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:” He makes the clouds His chariot.🛸The clouds are the so-called UFOs. They are the chariots of God. Ezekiel 1:4“And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.” Ezekiel saw the heavenly creatures and the chariots (clouds) of heaven. It came like a whirlwind, a great chariot, with a neon brightness of fire that glows, enfolding itself upon the body. The color in the middle of it was like amber, a pure golden color. Ezekiel 1:14“And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.” The living creatures move to and fro like lightning. Revelation 1:7“Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.” Every man left alive on Earth will be in the Eastern Hemisphere. They will see Christ when He returns according to prophecy. He will come with the mighty Angels, the Clouds of Heaven.God appeared to Moses in the burning bush. Exodus 3:13 “And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?” Moses asked God for His name, because the Egyptians called upon many gods. Exodus 3:14 “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” God told Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”. This is the name given to Moses and the Israelites when he appeared as a flame of fire out of the burning bush. He said go tell the children of Israel that \\"I AM\\" sent you. In the ancient Phoenician Hebrew tongue the Israelites spoke, the English words \\"I AM\\" translates to AHAYAH. The phrase \\"I AM THAT I AM\\" = “AHAYAH ASHAR AHAYAH”. Exodus 3:15“And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.” That is the name of the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob as a memorial forever unto all generations. The letters of His name are in all caps. No other name was given to man to call upon. Not Jehovah, Yahweh, Yahwei, YHWH, Yah, Jah, Lah, El Shaddai, Adonai, Yahuwah, Yahuwa, Yahuah, not even God (of ancient German origins) none of that. Just AHAYAH. This is His name forever, and ever, as a memorial unto all generations. Christ said: John 4:22“Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.” You have no idea what you worship. We who believe in the Heavenly Father know what we worship. Safety from moral and physical harm is of those who keep His commandments. Revelation 22:14“Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” This is why the Book of Revelation says, “Happy will be those who obey the Word of God”. They will be able to receive the Kingdom of Heaven. Revelation 22:15“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.” Those who do not receive the Kingdom are man of impure minds, workers of witchcraft bewitching the minds of the people, people who have sex outside of marriage, unrepentant killers, people who choose t live according to their own Way of Life on Earth without submitting to the Original Purpose that God created man to fulfill, and all talebearers who create and spread lies. THIS IS NEW TESTAMENTThe Disciples of Christ wrote this understanding in the New Testament to bring forth the Truth in Christ. John 7:38“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” WE must believe on Christ as it is written. 1 John 3:4“Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” Sin is the breaking of God’s laws. Romans 6:23“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” The payment for sin is death. The wages for living according to the Word of God is immortality. 1 John 1:6“If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:” If we profess to be a Christian, and do not keep the commandments, we lie and live in sin. Paul is showing us something. Romans 6:20“For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.” When we did not live according to the Word of God, we lived in sin. Romans 6:18“Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.” After we repented and got baptized into the Body of Christ for forgiveness of our sins, we became the servants of Christ who live in righteousness. Christ made it clear: John 3:5“Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” No man can receive Immortality and enter into the Kingdom of God unless they repent, get baptized into His body, and keep the commandments. UNDERSTANDING BAPTISM - PART 1 UNDERSTANDING BAPTISM - PART 2 Romans 6:21“What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.” Nothing we do can give us immortality, except obeying His word. Every other path leads to death in the end. 2 Esdras 16:66“What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels?” No man can hide anything from God. Ecclesiasticus 23:19“Such a man only feareth the eyes of men, and knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun, beholding all the ways of men, and considering the most secret parts.” Hebrews 4:13“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” He is the Supreme Intelligent Being. He has telepathy. None is more powerful than He, and all are exposed before His eyes. Wisdom of Solomon 11:23“But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend.” He winks at our sins, because He wants us to repent from our sins, worship Him, and receive eternal life. Acts 17:30“And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:” All man should repent and receive immortality. Acts 17:31“Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.” The Day of Judgment approaches. 2 Corinthians 5:10“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” We must all stand before the throne of His Christ in the Day of Judgment, to receive rewards for every action we committed while we lived on Earth. Good rewards for good deeds, and bad rewards for bad deeds. Romans 7:12“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” The laws of God are just, holy and good. If man wants to do good while he lives, he must apply the laws of God to his life. Romans 7:14“For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” The laws of God are spiritual. The ways of man are fleshly and carnal. Baptism into Christ and keeping the commandments gives us the Holy Spirit. Acts 19:1“And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,” Paul came across certain disciples on his travels. Acts 19:2“He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.” He asked them if they received the Holy Spirit since they started believing in Christ. They replied no. Ecclesiasticus 32:24“He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.” Believe is an action word. Those who believe in Christ will keep His commandments. Acts 19:3“And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.” Paul asked who they were they baptized under, and they replied under the baptism of John. Right here we can see that people can be baptized and still not receive the Holy Spirit. Acts 19:4“Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.” John’s baptism of repentance prepared the hearts and souls of the people to receive Christ when His ministry began. Acts 19:5“When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.” The disciples had to get baptized into the Body of Christ. Acts 19:6“And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.” Hands by an ordained minister of God had to be laid upon them, and then they were able to receive the Holy Spirit. 2 Esdras 16:67“Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all trouble.” In order to be saved, we must repent from our sins, live according to the Way that God ordained from Genesis to Revelations, and follow His word in order to fulfill prophecy, be delivered from condemnation, and receive immortality in the Kingdom of God. Believing in anything else is vain and futile.You are wasting your time. Isaiah 55:2“Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.” Why waste your time with things that cannot profit you after death? Psalms 53:1“The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.” The fool does not believe in God. He lives how he pleases on Earth, according to his own understanding, and not according to the instruction of God. Proverbs 8:5“O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.” God wants us to be of an understanding heart, to learn Righteousness and receive His instruction. Ecclesiasticus 10:12“The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.” Pride is when a man’s mind is turned away from the will of his Maker. Psalms 53:2“God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.” God knows we seek peace, love, joy, mercy, gentleness, goodness, and something to place our time and efforts into that will profit our soul. Psalms 53:3“Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.” Man has turned his heart away from his Maker, even God. They do not choose to LIVE. They choose to walk in the opposite path that leads to EVIL. The word LIVE backwards is EVIL. This is why God says the fool on Earth is gone backwards. They do not submit to His laws of Righteousness. Romans 1:21“Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” Wicked men know what is good, yet they choose to follow after the evil. Romans 1:25“Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.” Changing that which is upright into a vain image of the creature so that mankind all over the Earth can honor and worship the creatures of God more than their Creator. Christ said: John 4:24“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” We must worship the Heavenly Father in Spirit and Truth. Psalms 119:142“Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.” The Laws of God are the Truth. Romans 7:14“For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” The Laws of God are spiritual. Proverbs 6:23“For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:” The Laws of God are the light we must walk in to become immortal. Romans 7:12“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” The Laws of God are good.Man must walk in the Laws of God to do good. Matthew 5:16 “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” Christ commands His disciples to let the light shine among mankind, so they can see our good works and glorify our Heavenly Father whose dwelling is not on Earth, but in the thick dark Heaven above. Matthew 5:17“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.” Christ was not crucified to destroy the laws under the Old Covenant. He came to fulfill the Law of Sacrifice under the Old Covenant. Acts 3:18“But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.” Christ suffered on the cross to fulfill the Law of Sacrifice. Romans 3:20“Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” Keeping the Laws of God without being baptized into the Body of Christ will no longer justify us before the eyes of God. Romans 3:21“But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;” Hebrews 10:12“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;” Christ shed his blood on the cross, to be a sacrifice for all sin. Romans 3:22“Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:” To believe means to keep the commandments. All who truly believe in Christ must, repent from their sins, get baptized into His body, and keep the Laws of God. Ephesians 2:8“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:” Our salvation is Christ is not from our Faith alone, it is a gift freely given from the Heavenly Father. Romans 3:30“Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.” God will justify all man by the Faith of Christ. Romans 3:31“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” Do we continue living in sin just because we are under the Grace of God? Paul and Apostle of Christ says, No. We establish the Laws of God. Hebrews 9:16“For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.” Christ had to die in order for the New Covenant to be established. Hebrews 9:17“For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.” While Christ walked the Earth as a mortal man, the Old Covenant was still in effect. Colossians 2:16“Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:” Now that Christ has been crucified, we are to keep the Holy Days of God in Christ. No longer is animal sacrifice required to purge our sins when we seek forgiveness. No longer can people legally put us to death for breaking certain laws of God found under the Old Covenant. Colossians 2:6“As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:” We must now walk in the light. We know that the Laws of God are the light (Proverbs 6:23). 1 Peter 2:21“For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:” Christ let us the example to follow. We are to learn his ways and walk in them daily. 1 John 1:6“If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:” If we say we are Christians and do not keep the commandments of God, we are liars and do not exercise the Truth and Righteousness of God. 1 John 1:7“But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.” But, if we repent, get baptized into the Body of Christ, and keep the commandments, we have fellowship with Christ and His blood covers our sins. Hebrews 10:16“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;” He will teach us His ways under the New Covenant, and they will be in our hearts continually. We will know the Laws of God. Romans 10:8“But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;” The word will be in our heart and professed by our lips, even the Word of Faith that all of His children will proclaim. Romans 10:9“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” That if we confess with our lips that we need Christ to save us, obey the commandments of His word, and even know that the Heavenly Father raised up Christ from the dead for our sakes, we will be saved. John 14:15“If ye love me, keep my commandments.” Christ said the only way we can show Him that we love Him, is by keeping His commandments, which is obeying His word. Christ is the Word of God. Hebrews 6:1“Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,” Another word for \\"Principles\\" is \\"Plan\\", and another word of \\"Doctrine\\" is \\"Teaching\\". Leaving the plan of the Teachings of Christ, let us mature in Christ as the scriptures teach. Not living in sin to follow after the desires and worldly lusts of our own heart, but sober and righteously as obedient children of God. Hebrews 6:2“Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.” The Doctrine of Christ includes:1. Instruction on washing and conversion teachings concerning baptism.2. Instruction for consecrating persons for ministry and the invoking of divine blessings.3. Teachings concerning the Resurrection of the dead in Christ.4. Teachings of the Eternal Judgment where all souls will be judged by Christ. Hebrews 6:3“And this will we do, if God permit.” These are the things that the true children of God will do all over the Earth for as long as God permits. Isaiah 66:24“And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.” All who chose to follow the commandments of man and not God while they lived on Earth, will receive the reward of eternal punishment or not honoring God and giving Him glory. The scriptures reveal the reward for those who choose to continue living in sin. They have to deal with the fact that they did not adore Christ while they lived, but despised his ways. The recompense allotted to lovers of wicked works is eternal punishment. To them belongs the unquenchable fire without end, and a certain fiery worm that never dies. It does not destroy the body, but continues in its eruption out of the body with never-ceasing grief. They will not have rest, even sleep will not give ease or comfort to them. Death will be no more, completely unable to free them from their torment one immortality comes. Daniel 12:2“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” My desire is to enjoy my new spiritual body on Earth forever, and not to be anyone’s trophy in Hell. No longer will the prayers of the righteous intercede to protect and preserve the wicked who choose to live in error. Hebrews 10:38“Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.” The just will live by the Faith of Christ on Earth. If any man disregards the lifestyle God commands in the Bible while the lived on Earth, the blood of Christ will not cover their sins. They blaspheme the Holy Spirit. Matthew 12:31“Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.” Christ will forgive our sins if we slip up, repent, and get back on track, but turning away from keeping the commandments of God will never be forgiven. 1 Thessalonians 4:16“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:” All who died and slept in Christ from the beginning, until this time, will be resurrected by His Highest's Holy Word. Matthew 25:31“When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:” When Christ returns with the clouds of Heaven, He will rule over the Earth from the seat of Power. Mark 13:27“And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.” All over the Earth His chosen will be gathered. The dead in Christ will be resurrected. Matthew 25:32“And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:” All nations of man will be gathered unto Him in the Eastern Hemisphere, and the wheat will be separated from the tares. Matthew 25:33“And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” He will divide the righteous from the wicked. The righteous will be set on His right hand, and the wicked on His left hand. Matthew 25:34“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:” Happy are those who kept the commandments of God while they lived on Earth. They will be able to receive the Kingdom of God. Matthew 25:41“Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:” But, unto those who followed the Laws of Man and rejected the Laws of God, He will tell them to depart from Him and they will be cast into the Lake of Fire that has been prepared for the Devil and his angels. Even the devil has angels. Proverbs 3:5“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.” Follow Christ as it is written in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Psalms 119:142“Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.” The laws that God established are the truth and His righteousness endures forever. Idolatry is when a man chooses to follow his will above the will of God. Micah 6:8“He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” Ecclesiastes 12:13“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.” Ecclesiastes 12:14“For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” Revelation 20:12“And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” The souls of man will be judged by the Laws of God. Did they serve Him while they lived, or did they only serve man for money and a means of survival. Luke 12:15“And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” Goods and substance alone does not guarantee life. Matthew 4:4“But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Our life is sustained by the Word of God. Joshua 1:8“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.” We are commanded to read out of the Word of God daily. This will bring us prosperity and good success. Success is not just the gaining of riches and accomplishing of feats on Earth as the majority of man leads us to believe. The wisdom to endure is what true success brings Success is supposed to prolong our days. 𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐬 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐑𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲.We are the descendants of Noah. A royal people who have Power in God.

Ecclesiasticus 19:19“The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.” We were created to be immortal from the beginning, but we must learn how to stand in the Power thereof.

In September 1989, an IBM physicist [LINKED_TEXT: Don Eigler,] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd2dri9p_EI] became the first person ever to manipulate and position individual atoms. Less than two months later, he arranged 35 Xenon atoms to spell out the letters IBM. That was a most published image at the time. Writing those three characters took about 22 hours. Today, the process would take about 15 minutes. Once IBM researchers had the ability to position individual atoms, they had some fun. In 1993, they spelled the Kanji characters for the word atom using iron atoms on a copper surface. In 1996, The researchers also created the world’s smallest abacus with atoms. The abacus was created out of 10 carbon atoms and was seen as a milestone in nanoscale engineering. Moving the links of the abacus wouldn’t be easy and require the scanning tunneling microscope but with enough time and patience, it could be done. Image above: The world’s smallest abacus using atoms (left), Kanji characters for the word ‘atom’ (center) and a carbon monoxide man were some of the pictures created by moving atoms. In the “If you can read this, you are too close” image below, the letters are just 1 nanometer wide and 1 nanometer tall. Once they could manipulate individual atoms, the folks at IBM went to town - and have even created the world’s smallest movie, “A Boy and His Atom,” a short film that uses real atoms – carbon monoxide molecules – to tell the story of an atom boy playing with a single atom. The scientists utilized a massive tunneling microscope, operating at -268° Celsius, and moved the atoms frame by frame on a surface, then magnified it all 100 million times. To put it in perspective, if an atom were the size of an orange, an orange would be the size of Earth. - See more at: [LINKED_TEXT: IBM Creates World's Smallest Movie And ST Pics...

So I hired a surveyor, for around 3,000. Unfortunately, the surveyor did a poor job and surveyed the property in less than 2 hours, and set stakes in the rear (east part of my property) that implied I owned part of my back neighbor’s property.

The longest eulogy in Vedas belongs to Shiva, he is heavily and frequently mentioned in all Four Vedas, the most famous Rudrashtadhyayi the Vedic eulogy is greatest longest than any other stuti of any other forms of Gods in entire Vedas. Now some elaboration with lots of citation directly from all Vedas. Asking where Shiva is in Vedas or Is Shiva or Ganpati or Vishnu a Vedic God, Is like asking are rain drops made of water ? or where is water in the ocean?. Now this is height of Idiocy, Ocean is full of water, drinkable or not its not the question but element water is everywhere in the ocean and greater part of life is thriving under ocean water in the whole earth. Similarly Shiva is everywhere in Vedas a gullible below avg may understand it or not. Because most people are unlearned who have actually not read Vedas or scriptures but like sheeps they simply follow some Daassas or TV wala baba, than vomit there sick minds false and ill knowledge. Here I would try to be precise but fact full because elaborating Vedas about Shiva, there so much of material that it will become a new Veda itself as it will be explanatory in metaphysical and scientific terms too. Because Shiva has inherent connection with science the scientific community recognizes him as Alpha and Omega for that they also have installed huge Nataraj Shiva,s Idol in front of HOLY GRAIL of science The Hadron collider LHC at the Heart of CERN. The point is when some one or say in plural,when human wanted to know greatest or most basic reason for this entire cosmos having infinite galaxies at the utmost humanly possible depth they have found it to be SHIVA.Hence the Vedic Rishis who were scientists of Meta Physical realm who USED TO FREQUENT BETWEEN PARALLEL UNIVERSES also researched and found Shiva or Rudra as the Greatest Tattwa, The final god The reason the Cause of all the Effects of the Universe and they have elaborated there research and described Shiva as greatest God ultimate. So even by science you wont stumble upon jesus or any other Sanatana Gods or so called human made Gods but, SHIVA ONLY ,the formless base of Universe the power of all the energy factor of universe.Dr. John Haglin, Einstien of this age, among scientists Describe Shiva of Vedas as Quantum Unified field, The power behind entire existence infinite Cosmos and all Big Bangs, which is reality and science of Shiva Lingam, Shiva Lingam is a technical and True shape of Godly Supra Energy Vortex the formless form of quantum unified field. To explain this we need another answer,but that will be a different subject, But the point is scientists and true seekers whenever they found ultimate truth through Spirituality or through Science have found ONLY SHIVA as Finality. From where nothing goes beyond every thing ends and emerges from here Only. So Here i will elaborate how Rig Veda than all other Vedic texts of all Four Vedas and there branches and cover verifiable Facts and truth, not hear say or any cults false doctrines But pure Vedic God Shiva, no Smriti or other Scriptures.Check How Sir and Dr John Hagelin describes Vedic Shiva as silent Ruler most powerful most beautiful the Alpha and Omega.[LINKED_TEXT: Dr. Hagelin Reveals The Reality Of The Silent Ruler Of The Universe Shiva As Expressed By The Superstring Of The Unified Field] [URL: http://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=5030]. Vedas sing more eulogies of Shiva Rudra or Raudragni, Jaatveda Than any other Lord or Gods. Even from the very first Shloka Mantra of very first Veda The Rig Veda they started Singing praises of Rudra Shiva and his major eight forms which covers entire universe with five elements and Pran, Atman and Pradhan.If you will read the first Veda, It starts from praying Shiva Rudra from very first Shloka, “Agni milite Purohitam” , (Agni is Shiva or Rudras Form one of his eight Vedic manifestations). There are several Suktas dedicated only to him. In Rig Veda and in fact same is the case with other three Vedas Rudra Shiva is everywhere in Aranyaks, Bramhans, Upnishads, Gyan khand ,karma kand, Jyotish, vyakaran i mean, where you wont find him when you read how Vedas describe him its like looking for gold in mine full of gold and and some nerd asks where is gold in the mine, well it is still here not only one can see but one can experience it too. So Rudra is mentioned in Shlokas, Mantras, Suktas (for which You will have plenty of evidence from real text below in this write up) even whole Upanishads are dedicated to him only. The Gyan khand of Vedas which is main part of Vedas metaphysical science is known as Upanishads. Now among 108 Valid Upanishads of Muktika Cannon from all four Vedas more than 42 + (16 unpublished Upanishads) are dedicated to Shiva exclusively and inclusively. And That is more than half of total text, And that is much much more than any other single Gods eulogy in Vedas, How else glory of greatest God would be sung if not like this. In the Shatarudriya and in the whole Veda, Rudra is called Siva, Sankara, Sambhu, Isana, Isa, Bhagavan, Bhava, Sarva, Ugra, Soma, Pasupati, Nilagriva, Girisa, Mahadeva and Mahesvara among thousands of other names. Vedic Hymns The MahaRudrashtadhyayee. The most famous and Longest eulogy among all, The Rudrashtdhyayi which consists of Eight major Suktas belongs to Shiva Rudra Only, it is the Greatest Longest most powerful eulogy Vedas have ever sung for a Single God Head among all other Vedic Gods. In Shiva Rudra merge all Gods, The ShatRudriyam or Shree Rudra Sukta or Rudra Neela Sukta is repeated in all Vedas many times not only in Both Shukla and Krishna Yajurveda, than Rig Veda also has so many Rudra Sooktas, Atharva Veda and Saamveda have way many Suktas mantras for Shiva Rudra and his synonyms. This is most repeated eulogy in all Vedas and its various branches.Search net and find 1000 of links for Rudri at you tube, Shiva is the only Godhead for whom greatest and longest and most powerful eulogy was made, None other God commands such high respect, fear and awe that even Panch Bramhas bow in front of him (Ganpati Kartik, Durga, Vishnu, surya and Rudra). The Rudrabhishekam with Rudram MahaNyasam is one of the most elaborated methodical worship in Karma Kanda of any single Vedic God ever. The Worship ceremony is so powerful that even if it is still done rightly miracles do happen, ask any astrologer about, what he would consider the most powerful Upay or Solutions for things, he must suggest, all would suggest Mahamrityunjay Jaap ,Rudrabhsihekam and Shat chandi as most powerful solutions for any mundane or spiritual thing, thus still millions of people organize it and get what they want with simple good. Its sung in all major Shiva Temples everyday. And about this great eulogical Worship and this mantra scripture Declared that VR^ixasya mUlakena shakhAH puShyanti vai yathA |shive rudrajapAtprIte prItA evAsya devatAH |ato rudrajapAdeva bhuktimuktiprasiddhyataH || Even as by (watering) the roots of a tree, all its branches are nourished, so by pleasing Shiva with the chant of the Rudram , all the gods are pleased. Therefore, the attainment of bhukti - enjoyment - and mukti - liberation- is only through chanting the Rudram with devotion. Vedas saw and witnessed him as Final God, The God of all Gods, The father of Trinity, and whole universe, who has no body above him, there is no one beyond or second to him,”Eko hi Rudro na Dwiteeyay”.He is alone Swayambhu (Self Reliant) and (Beejak) Seed Giver of entire existence and Vishnu is Yoni (Womb) of universe, “Vishnurvishwa JagatYonih” Shiva is Reason of all the Causes and Cause of every Effect “Karnam Parama Kaaranat”.Vedas Declared him Sovereign Lord of all that exists, “Vishwadhipo Rudrah Maharshih”. (YajurVeda)The one in front of whom all Gods including Bramha and Vishnu have accepted there animal instinct, and declared him as Pashupati The lord of all gods and all beings “Sarwe Deva Pashutamvapu Swayam Tasmat Pashupatir Babhoov”. (Yajur Veda). The Only God head whose energies never depart from him, “īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam”. (Rig Veda) Who is above time the Kaala, the one and only Mahakaala and Sadashiva Rudra. “Yo Vampaden jaghan Kaalam”. He kicked Kaal and subdued him, he (Time) favours him and his bhaktas always.All Four Vedas were very peculiar, straightforward and truthful about Him. He was referred frequently as None like others, The one and Only without a second, No one but Him, “Sa Eko Rudro dheyah Sarvesham”, “ Eko Hi Rudro”, “Aek aiwa Shivo”, “Saeesh aesh aive Rudro”.Even they went to the extent to declare that, leave all Gods who are Pawns of MahaRudra instead worship Him only, through One pointed high Devotion. “Aek aiwa Shivo nityastato anyatsakalam mrisha tasmat sarwanparityajya Dhyeyaan Vishnawadikansuran” (Atharvaveda). These are the kind of ways Vedas tell about him and read Vedas they do not confer that status to any other God so highly and frequently, declaring the Code of Adwait, That the truth is God is one, Jeeva is fragment or Shiva God. Hence Jeeva is also Shiva, or to say that to become Shiva is Goal of every Jeeva because it is fragment of SHIVA. In Shwetashwatar Upnishad, all Rishis have assembled together and did “Shastrarth” research on Param Bramha God, they came to know that discussion wont be able to establish the truth hence they all meditated for several celestial years with an inquiry that who is that one from whom everything comes and merges in, who is existent before time who is that One Final God of Gods who has no body above, nothing beyond. And after many years and continuous Samadhi (Ultra Aplha State of Mind) it was Revealed to Bramha Rishi, Shwetashwatar he got enlightened and he floating in ether with immense bliss and divine illumination declared to all Rishis Thus spake the great Rishi in second shloka mantra of third adhyay (chapter) of Shwetashwatar Upnishad of YajurVeda, which is one of the prime 6 Upnishads :- Eko hi Rudro na dvitīyāya tasthurya imāṃl lokān īśata īśanībhiḥ / pratyaṅ janās tiṣṭhati saṃcukocāntakāle saṃsṛjya viśvā bhuvanāni gopāḥ // Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second, He alone rules all the worlds by His powers. He dwells as the inner Self of every living being. After having created all the worlds, He, their Protector, takes them back into Himself at the end of time. Not only this Upanishad but YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6, clearly states Rudra as Pashupati and Lord of sacrifices and as The Greatest One God without a second.. \\"Pasunam sarma asi sarma yajamanasya sarma me yacha Eka Eva Rudro Na Dvitiyaya Tasthe Akhusthe Rudra Pasuh Tam Jushasva.YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6. We Pray to Lord of all Sacrifices and The Lord of all Gods who is Rudra only the greatest Lord of entire cosmos who has none as second, and all beings and Gods are his Pets (Pashus) and he alone is there master there sole lord The Pashupati. Rudra is frequently referred in Vedas as Shiva, 'Shivo namasi' (Yaj. S. 3-63) clearly calls him Shiva than.The Famous and most popular among masses Panachkashar mantra of Shiva is Pure Vedic, the Central Mantra of all vedas, where other popular mantras are not Vedic necessarily, Panchakshar Mahavidya Mantra is established in the very heart of all Vedas deliberately in Yajurvedas the MANTRA occurs in Taittareeya . 4. 5, 1-41. \\"Namah shambhave cha mayobave cha namah Sankaraya cha mayaskaraya cha NAMAHA SH1VAYA cha Sivataraya cha\\" And the famous Shatarudriyam or RudraNeel Suktam or Rudrashtdhyayi which is highly praised in the Upanishadas and in the Purans & all scriptures, forms also the central portion of this central Veda. And this is a description of God as the all, the all in all, and transcending all, 'Visvadevo, Visvasvarupo, Visvadhiko.Rudra as Pashupati - lord of all beings including all Gods and humans and animals.Mohenjodaro a culture 7500 years ancient shows that Shiva Lingam and shiva as Pashupati was the main deity of those times in all over the world. A Pashupati Seal found there is very famous among archaeologists and anthropologists. And the Root of Pashupati is of course In Vedas. All over the world at even very unlikely places like Vatican or Africa or Greece archaeologists have found Shiva lingas which are millions or years ancient. In Vatican they have placed the ancient shiva linga at Vatican museum just beside the main church it is at least 10000 years old as per carbon dating, So it is very apparent that Shiva is the most ancient even the first God ever to be worshipped on this planet or universe.Shiva is declared as Pashupati in Vedas and Pashus (animals) are not what you think, Pashupati does,nt mean Lord of animals but entire universe and all Sentient beings and all Gods accepted that they are Pashus because of having animal instinct and being inflicted by Panch Pashas (Five affliction) which influence all beings even Bramha or Vishnu or Avataras are afflicted by these Five Pashas hence including them entire Universe of beings are Pashus (Pets of Shiva), and he alone is Pashupati there Master There owner. He is Lord of all beings who are afflicted with Five Pashas ( chains ) and everything that exists and gods are also chained by these pashas like lust, anger, false ego, envy and selfishness etc. All Devas accepted the truth of being pashus, including Vishnu Bramha and Indra and performed Pashupat Vow to appease shiva so he would absolve there pashas and set them free destroying these chains and establishing the jeeva in bliss of Shiva forever. Whenever Vishnu takes avatar he performs Pashupat Vrata, Bible also The God is called Shepherd and all beings as his flocks or Sheeps or animals, this allegory has root in this Vedic incidence only asserts scholars. How he came to be known as such, Here is the description-:Yajur Veda, 6th Kanda, 2nd Prasna, 3rd Anuvaka and 12th Mantra. Mahapuram Jayantiti ta ishum Samas Kurva to gnium anikan Soman Salyam Vishum Tejanam the bruvan ka imam asishatita Rudra iti aleruvan rudro vai Krura; Somya twiti, sobravit Varam Vrina aham eva Pasunam Adhipatirasaniti tasmat rudrah Pasunam adhipatishtam rudrova Srijat Satisra Puro bhitva ebhyo: lokebhys Suran pranudata.\\"There were the three cities of iron, silver, and gold (belonging) to Asuras. The gods not being able to win them (by fight) wished to win them by siege. (The great) say that He (the Brahmin &c), who knows (what ought to be known) and he (the non-Brahmin &c), who does not know - they are able to win by seige the great city which cannot be overtaken by fight:Then the gods made an arrow composed of Agni as (the bottom hilt) Soma as (the middle) iron and Vishnu as (the top) and declared (consulted) who will discharge it, and determined None but MahaRudra, (was) as only and Greatest God amongst them all, being capable of discharging such an apocalyptic weapon which carried all the weight and might of all Devas. Upon hearing such request) He (The Rudra) said the boon was made over, From Now on whole Universe must know the truth and accept that I am the Lord of Infinite Cosmos, all of you, all Gods and all beings are my Pashus (pets afflicted by five pashas ), hence all are Pashus both the two-footed Devas and manushyas and four-footed; So Rudra the Lord of Pashus, The Pashunampatim discharged it, broke up these three cities, and blew them up all from these worlds.\\" Aum namo bhagavate RudrAya In this Mantra, the Highest Reality, Brahman is identified with Rudra who is MASTER of Trinity who assigned the three functions of creation, protection or maintenance and dissolution of the universe to three Gods. The epithet Rudra means the destroyer of all that is false or evil, ignorance and their effects, sin sorrow and suffering and who confers wisdom and bliss the Rig Veda Rudra is the personification of Brahman in three rounded [LINKED_TEXT: a] [URL: http://aspect.in/]spect the later portion of the Veda, Rudra is described as Siva, the auspicious, as Mahadeva, the great God. Vedas also say about two aspects of Shiva viz., The Ghora meaning fierce the terrible and Aghora, Saumya meaning the benevolent kind and auspicious . The Upanishad speaks about Brahman as Rudra, its teaching lays stress on the destruction of Sin and Agyan (ignorance) by Shiva worship and great Spiritual progress.Rig Veda starts from praying to Shiva Agnimilite Purohitam ,and Agni is one of the eight manifestations of Rudra as mentioned above, Agni is also called Prana, and Prana is Rudra (Brihadaranyak Upnishad),Sashpinjaray twasheemate (Shatrudriya Shukla Yajurveda), says We bow to the God who is fire (Agni) flaming bright Red with a yellow divine hue. And there are many places where Agni, Rudra, Prana, Atman, Parmatman, are said to be synonyms and used in interpolating ways. The RigVeda 6.49.10 calls Rudra as “Bhuvanasya Pitraah” The Father of the Universe. Bhuvanasya pitaram ghīrbhirābhī rudram divā vardhayā rudramaktau | brhantam rshvamajaram sushmnam rdhagh ghuvema kavineshitās. “Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father. Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us. Now examine how else Vedas would describe the greatest Lord who is god of all Gods and entire universe. They revere him as “Bhuvansya Pitrah” ,the father of entire existence of beings and Cosmos, So he is not a simple Deity or warrior God as unlearned dumb people say but he is regarded as Supreme God Head, Father of entire universe who has no body above or beyond there is no body equal or second to him. He is sovereign Lord The Master of Entire existence, and this declares all Vedas Unanimously thousands of times and this assert Rig veda more in this Mantra The Rig Veda, 2.33.9 calls Rudra as \\"The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe\\" Iśānādasya Bhuvanasya .Sthirebhiranghaih pururūpa ughro babhruh śukrebhih pipiśehiranyaih | īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam ||' With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations: The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign God of this Universe , the All mighty.' Now Veda is mentioning Shiva Rudra as Iśānādasya, The soveriegn GODHEAD of bhuvanasya bhūrerna, Entire Universe three worlds all which exists and beyond. Or does any clearer words are needed to convey and understand logically and truthfully and honestly that Rudra or Shiva is regarded as Supreme most God Head who is self energized whose ultimate super most power never departs from him, who is father and guardian of entire Universe and all Gods and beings. Than Rig Veda 2.33.10 Na vā ojīyo rudra tvad astiA Mighter and Greater than you there is none, O Rudra. Rig Veda 7.46.1, Aṣālhāya sahamānāya vedhase. Rig Veda. 2.33.3. Tavastamas tavasāMightiest of the mighty. Whom no one may overcome. The most famous Shiva Mantra Tryambak Mantra or MahaMrityunjay mantra is in Rig Veda, Rig Veda 7.59.12. Tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam Urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya mā'mṛtāt We worship Tryambaka, sweet augmenter of prosperity. As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from the bonds of death, not reft of immortality. kad rudrāya pracetase mīḍhuṣṭamāya tavyase। vocema śaṃtamaṃ hṛde(RigVeda 1.43.1) What shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise, That shall be dearest to his heart? RigVeda 2.33.8maho mahi suṣṭutim īrayāmī, gṛṇīmasi tveṣaṃ rudrasya nāmaḥ. I utter forth mighty hymn of praises.We sing the splendid name of Rudra. kumāraś cit pitaraṃ vandamānam prati nānāma rudropayantam (RigVeda 2.33.12) I have surrendered myself to you as a boy to the respected father approaching. bhiṣaktamaṃ tvā bhiṣajāṃ śṛṇomī (RigVeda 2.33.4) I hear you as the most curing among all curing. Haste vibhrad bheṣajā vāryāṇī śarma varma chardira (RigVeda 1.114.5) Whose hand filled of greatest miraculous medicines. Grant us refugee, protection and shelter. apabhartā rapaso daivyasyābhī (RigVeda 2.33.7) Deliverer from defect of the Gods.bṛhantamṛṣvamajaraṃ (RigVeda 6.49.10) bhūrer dātāraṃ (RigVeda 2.33.12) The giver of many.mṛtyormukṣīya māmṛtā (RigVeda 7.59.12) who provides immortality through Moksha.Revealing of Desire of Rudra Consciousness RigVeda also reveals about state which sages seek where perfect thoughts of Lord Rudra comes to their mind. ie. Wishing of full mind devotion to Lord Rudra: ]ā te pitara marutāṃ sumnam etu (RigVeda 2.33.1) May your perfect thought come to us Oh father of Maruts.ā vivāseyaṃ rudrasya sumnam (RigVeda 2.33.6) May perfect thought of Rudra comes in mind. Lord Rudra in Vedas has one peculiar characteristic ie. He is stated as the one without second frequently . YajurVeda Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6 clearly states 'Eka Eva Rudro Na Dwitiya.' 'Rudra yields none to second.' Now a question arises whether this is just Arthavãda or has special significance. It is not Arthavãda because same verse is derived by Svetasvatara Upanishad in 3.1 and used as to glorify Brahman 'Eko hi Rudro Na Dwitiyaya... '. So, Lord Rudra is the one who is without second. Same thing is also revealed in Rudra Suktas of RigVeda: also Shivas fragment, which Shree Shankaracharya re established again.He is no regular God, He can absolve any Karma change destiny and capable of giving well being of all kinds here and in afterworlds. He is the greatest Surgeon greatest Healer The Vaidynatham. And he can liberate Give moksha to his Devotees Kaivalya Bramha . Those who worship him with devotion are devoid of death or any thing negative.All Vedas declare Shiva as Most terrifying Destroyer of Gods and Death even (Ghora), and also consider him as Ultra benevolent greatest healer and happiness giver who can enlighten and change destiny if needed for welfare of his Devotee a bhakta, (Aghor) who protects and prospers his worshipers.Now here i would mention the Upanishads which are dedicated to Shiva only. As gyanis know that upanishads are the main part of vedas, among 108 Upanishads as per Muktika canon half of them are dedicated to Shiva, so one can imagine what authority superiority Shiva has in Vedas or even Puranas or tantra Shiva is everywhere like water in the ocean and always revered as Greatest God as he is famously Called Mahadev (The Greatest God of all Gods).Its not that, that only Shaiwa Upnishads praises Shiva but in Vaisnava, Shakta, Ganpatya, Sauree (sun worship), GyanYog, Sanyas based Upanishads etc also consider Shiva as greatest God. Examples are thousands but i will write three that will suffice as even a glimpse of truth is enough to establish it.Mahanarayan Upanishad which obviously praises Vishnu shows him as ParBramha, In this Upnishad also when rishis assembled and contemplated on greatest God the Finality to whom shall they devote themselves the final greatest God as they say here Kim Deva Havisha Vidhem, they also conferred that God to be Shiva Rudra only and this is Vaishnav Upanishad you can check i am mentioning chapters etc. In adhyay (chapter) 2 rishis contemplate on who is the final god to which we may offer our greatest oblations, from 1 to 19 shloka they discuss about it, and in 21 st shloka they invoke agni and than they declare. Purushasya Vidmam Sahstraakshas Mahadevasya Dheemahi Tanno Rudrah Prachodayat. We desire to go towards Mahadev Rudra who is omnipotent having Thousands of eyes he is Greatest God of all Gods, our mind heart and intellect must always be with his divinity, bliss and Benevolence. Than again at anuvak 12 of this upanishads declares. Yo Devanam Prabhavashchodbhavashch Vishwadhipo Rudro Maharshih Hiranyagarbham janyamas Poorvam sano Budhya Shudhya sanyunaktu. We bow to the one who is sole master of universe who creates this universe all beings and Gods sustains them by his power and he merges them back in himself may such great lord bless us with divine bliss full intellect with devotion.Than from 19th anuvaak panch bramha mantras of shiva are given namely Sadyojat mantra, Vaamdev mantra, Tatpurush Mantra, Aghora Mantra, and Ishan mantra.I ts not only this upanishad but Shakta and other upanishads even of Gyan Yoga Shakha who worship formless form only also worship Shiva and consider him Greatest among all Gods. Gayatri rahsyopnishad says that the God or gayatri mantra is Sadashiva the goal of gayatri mantra is rudra only Devasya iteendro devo dyotat iti, sa indrastasmat sarvapurusho naam Rudrah. The God who is beyond senses and mind who is God and maker of all Gods, we know the Lord of this mantra as Sadashiva but none other. Again gyan shakhas Upanishad amritnadopnishad, the upnishads belonging to this shakha are never tilted towards any God, But they state truth of Gods as they witnessed and experienced them.Its first chapters second shloka Omkaar rath marumhya Vishnumkritvarth sarthimBramha loka padaanveshi Rudra raadhan tatparah Taking Omkar mantra as your chariot make shree Vishnu your Guru, the one who desires to achieve beyond Bramhaloka (immense bliss of shiva) must always worship Rudra with devotion and diligence. Now here are Upnisahds of Shiva, referring shlokas of these Upanishads is not necessary as they are totally devoted to Shiva Principle Tattva. Read any of them or all of them Shiva is everywhere, and even in Vaisnava, Shakta, Ganpatya, Sauree (sun worship) etc also consider Shiva as greatest God. Shivas Upnishads Of Rig Veda -: Nirvaan Upnishad, AtmaBodh Upnishad, Akshamalika Upnishad, NaadBindu Upnishad, Tripura Upnishad. SamVeda-: Kena Upnishad, Kundika Upanishad, RudrakshaJabal Upnishad, Jabal Upnishad, Yogachudamani Upnishad, Mah Upnishad. YajurVeda (Krishna)-: Amrit nada Upanishad, Amrit bindu Upanishad, Shwetashwatar Upanishad, Skanda Upanishad, Sarvasaar Upanishad, Akshi Upanishad, Avadhoota Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Kalagni Rudropanishad, Rudrahridaya Upanishad, Panchbramha Upanishad, Dakshinamurti Upanishad, Yogakundalini Upanishad, Shukarahasya Upanishad, Bramha vidya Upanishad. Yajurveda (Shukla)- Mantrikopnishad, Adyatma Upanishad, Jabaalopnishad, Turiyateeta Upanishad, AdvayaTaraka Upanishad, Paramhansa Upanishad.AtaharvaVeda- Parambramha Upanishad, Atharvashiras Upanishad, Atharvashikha Upanishad, Brihajjabal Upanishad, Sharabh Upanishad, Bhasmajabaali Upanishad, Pashupat Upanishad, Mandukya Upanishad,Mahavakya Upnishad. And there are around 21 unpublished Shaiwa Upanishads which i am not including.Now You can find Shiva in all of these Upanishads few of them are widely available in many translations. I can as said above write a fat book on Shiva in each Veda separately but as a write up or answer this is more than enough to establish that as Sun is the centre of our solar system, so is Shiva the greatest God among all as Vedas not said or sung but DECLARED. EKO HI RUDRO NA DWITEEYAY. Only Rudra is Lord of all Gods and existence, there not exists a second or equal To him, He is Lord of all (bramha vishnu and all gods) multiverses of this universe. (which is but tiny molecule in divine Body of Shiva).

Make a fire escape plan. If a fire breaks out in your home, you must flee as soon as possible. Prepare an escape plan with your family ahead of time. Make certain that everyone is aware of at least two unobstructed exits - including windows - from each room. (If you live in an apartment building, take the stairs rather than the elevator if you need to escape a fire.) Choose an outdoor meeting location. Make sure your entire family practises your escape plan at least twice a year. 3. Keep an eye out for smokers In North America, careless smoking is the leading cause of fire deaths. Smoking in bed or while drowsy can be fatal. Provide large, deep, non-tip ashtrays to smokers, and soak butts in water before discarding them. Check under cushions and around upholstered furniture for smouldering cigarettes before going to bed or leaving the house after someone has smoked. 4. Keep in mind that matches and lighters are only for adults! Use only child-resistant lighters and keep all matches and lighters up high, out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Teach children that matches and lighters are only for adults. Teach young children to notify an adult if they find matches or lighters; older children should immediately bring matches and lighters to an adult. 5. Kitchen safety Always stay close to the cooking to keep an eye on it. Cooking areas should be kept free of combustibles, and you should wear clothes with short, rolled-up, or tight-fitting sleeves. Turn pot handles inward on the stove so they don't get bumped and children don't grab them. Make a three-foot (one-meter) \\"kid-free\\" zone around your kitchen range. If grease catches fire in a pan, cover it with a lid and turn off the heat source. Keep the lid on the pan until it is completely cool.

Give space heaters space Portable and space heaters should be kept at least three feet (one metre) away from anything that can burn. Keep children and pets away from heaters, and turn them off before leaving the house or going to bed. 7. Use electricity safely If an electric appliance begins to smoke or emits an unusual odour, unplug it immediately and have it serviced before reusing it. Replace any cracked or frayed electrical cords. Only one electrical cord should be plugged into each receptacle. Cords should not be run under rugs. Don't tamper with your fuse box or use fuses that aren't the correct size. 8. Cool a burn For 10 to 15 minutes, run cool water over a burning object. Never use ice. Never use butter or any other type of grease to put out a fire. Consult a doctor right away if the burned skin blisters or becomes charred. 9. Crawl low under smoke If you encounter smoke while evacuating from a fire, take a different route. If you must flee through smoke, crawl on your hands and knees with your head 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 centimetres) above the floor, where the air is cleaner. 10.

Clearly, “right” means different things at different times to different people. Of course you don’t have a Constitutional human right to the free use of a doctor’s services, especially not if the doctor herself doesn’t want to offer them. But when people say “healthcare is a right”, that’s not what they mean. They mean everyone deserves access to healthcare regardless of ability to pay.

Many, many doctors support universal healthcare, so it’s obviously not backdoor slavery. It’s straightforward. Nobody is trying to change the definition of human rights.

The parents wouldn’t need to be evil. It’s just a simple solution to an immediate problem if a society doesn’t offer them better options.

Let me first recommend several good books on the subject. The third book is a good source of information about how the medieval Chinese mostly infantry army coped with horse-mounted northern Asian raids, incursions, and full-scale invasions. Roman Soldier vs Parthian Warrior. 2020. Si Sheppard. Osprey Publishing, Ltd., Great Britain.Rome’s Enemies 3, No. 175. Parthians and Sassanid Persians. Peter Wilcox and Angus McBride. 1986. Osprey, an imprint of Reed International Books, Ltd. London, Great Britain.Defending Heaven. China’s Mongol Wars 1209–1370. 2013. Frontline Books, an imprint of Pen & Sword Books, Ltd. S. Yorkshire, Great Britain. What ancient history lessons taught from the Roman-Parthian wars were these: a) It is better to extend the infantry’s line rather than form into a defensive square or circle. The latter surrenders all initiative and tactical maneuver to the horse-mounted opponent. Extending the line is better for preventing outflanking and being surrounded plus the infantry retains some element of defensive maneuver. At Carrhae, Crassus initially intended to extend his legions’ lines, according to the advice of his subordinate officers. But for reasons lost to history, he changed his mind and redeployed into a defensive circle or square. The attacking Parthian army of 10,000 light archer horsemen and 1,000 heavily armored cataphracts circled Crassus’ compacted army of 28,000 and shot them down at leisure all through the day. b) Marc Antony learned from Crassus’ mistakes. He brought along large numbers of slingers and archers to screen his legions and keep the Parthian mounted archers from closing in. A lead sling ball has twice the range of a stone sling ball and possesses deadly penetrative power, even against armored cataphracts. Antony also did not allow himself to get drawn into close battle on terrain suited for horsemen, that is, large, wide open, relatively flat ground with excellent visibility all around for miles. Antony did his best to stick to terrain that was unsuitable for a horse-mounted army and used rivers for transport as well as keeping his men supplied with water. Antony’s mistake was to split his force when advancing in haste. He left his siege train behind covered with what he thought was an adequate security force of two legions. The commander entrusted with the two legions should have posted adequate reconnaissance. The Parthians ambushed the siege train in force, scattered the two covering legions and seized the siege train, burning the catapults and ballistas. Without his siege train and already sustaining heavy losses, Antony retreated, keeping to rough terrain, fighting all the way back through Parthia and through treacherous Armenia to the safety of Roman territory. c) During the time of Diocletian the Roman Army introduced an auxiliary weapon for the legionary soldiers. This was the, ‘Plumbata’, also sometimes referred to as, ‘Martiobarbulus’. The plumbata was a dart about 12 inches or so long. One third of its length was a thin iron shaft tipped with a wicked, sharp, barbed point. The barbs were long and obviously intended to stick in flesh and extremely difficult to extract without a trained medic or surgeon’s skill. The remaining 2/3rds length was a wood shaft, thicker than the metal shaft and lined with three or four leather vanes, possibly of other materials, leaving about a one inch clear distance to the end so it could be gripped by the thumb and fingers. At the junction of the iron shank to the wood shaft, an oval lead weight connected the two together. The oval lead gave the plumbata its weight and thus throwing distance and penetrative power. Historians believe the legionary gripped the one-inch or so bottom portion of the dart and either tossed it high overhand or high underhand, like the old game of lawn darts, jarts, now a prohibited toy due to its danger. The idea was for thousands of legionaries to toss these plumbata darts high in the air to descend like a swarm of hornets onto onrushing horsemen. The darts were too small to possess real killing power but it did possess terrible wounding capability, sticking into the arms, bodies, and heads of the unarmored light archers, preventing them from using their recurve bows. If the dart struck the horse there was a chance the wounded horse would rear and throw its rider. The plumbata must have been effective because evidence points to its continued use for almost two centuries. The advantage was that the legionary could now defend himself against hostile horsemen and the legion did not have to rely on procuring large numbers of mercenary slingers and archers, not always available in the numbers needed plus the added expense of paying and supporting them. 4) Emperor Trajan is the one renown emperor who knew how to deal with the Parthian horse-mounted light archer army and the heavy armored cataphracts. Trajan also used terrain to his advantage, keeping away from open, flat terrain advantageous to horsemen. He used rivers and waterways for transport and logistics as much as possible. Historians believe Trajan used night attacks on the camping Parthians. Horses ridden during the day need to be fully rested at night. Nighttime was vulnerable for the Parthians. Trajan defeated the Parthians but not decisively. He briefly seized Parthia but almost immediately revolts broke out all over Parthia. Trajan’s legions were spread far too thin. Supplying them was a logistics nightmare. He also could not keep all of his legions permanently in Parthia. He needed to return some of the legions to guard the northern European frontier. Faced with reality, Trajan withdrew, giving up his Parthian conquest. After Trajan died, the Parthians would attempt a measure of revenge by a small counter invasion of Roman territory in the east, thinking that his successor, Antoninus Pius, would prove less capable. The Parthians were proved wrong and were later forced back into Parthia."},{"prompt":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

I have kind of an issue with this question- I mean, I understand what the questioner is asking, but it ignores a lot of things about what constitutes “manly” and what doesn’t. The problem I see runs something like this: I’m a man (for example). Therefore, everything I do is “manly”. or, to put it another way, everything I do is something man does. Just as everything every woman does is “feminine”, simply by virtue of the fact that she does it. It sounds ridiculous, but I think that our societal ideas about what makes males “men” and females “women” are a large part of why we’re seeing such a surge of mostly younger people deciding that they’re transgender, or non-binary, or whatever the term for gender dysphoric is this week. I think that as a society, it would probably do us good to reevaluate our gender roles- I can’t prove it, and could certainly be wrong, but I suspect that in a world where men were not expected to be physically strong, devoid of any emotion more complex than anger, sex-crazed and aesthetically retarded, women might feel freer to ignore pressures to act weaker, pretend to be incompetent, welcome their objectification as sex objects, and avoid logical thinking in favor of emotional over-wroughtness. If we could, if not eliminate, at least greatly reduce gender stereotyping in our culture, I think that we would quickly see a great reduction in the number of boys that think that they were meant to be girls, and vice versa. I realize this doesn’t answer the question posed by the questioner. I guess my answer is that the “manliest” thing I’ve seen done is whatever the last male person I saw was doing."},{"prompt":"Where do I find a local professional knitter?

If your friends are supportive then it's ok… but if they can take away your time don't talk with them….Focus more on numerical rather than theory…If you have more time study every topic … if you have less time study important topics… but make sure you cover all subjects… skipping topics is somewhat acceptable .. but skipping subject is highly bad…Practice variety rather than quantity..While solving full length test make sure you use scribble pad with less pages… in actual gate exam scribble pad has 18 pages i.e 9 papers..Practice sums only with virtual calculator on laptop and using mouse… however simple or complicated the calculations may be use virtual calculator…If you are solving problems from books make sure you select the relevant questions related to gate…. Some qsns may require taking value from steam table and psychrometry chart which are not asked in Gate exam….Prepare short notes as soon as the subject is over…Practice formulas by writing them again and again…Note down your mistakes and work on them…Never focus on restricting your diet thinking you will put weight… eat whatever you want only if it is made in your home… avoid junk food and outside food..Never double check your answer if steps are lengthy….

Do you know why?","completion":"There could be a few reasons why a WhatsApp call may be placed on hold: Poor internet connection: If the internet connection on either end of the call is weak or unstable, the call may be placed on hold as a way to preserve the connection.Other apps or processes using bandwidth: If other apps or processes are using a significant amount of bandwidth on your device, they could be causing the call to be placed on hold.Battery saver mode: Some devices have a battery saver mode that reduces the performance of apps in order to conserve battery life. This could cause the call to be placed on hold.Interference from other communication apps: If you are using another communication app like Skype or Zoom, it may be interfering with the WhatsApp call.Interference from VPN: If you are using a VPN, it may be interfering with the WhatsApp call, causing it to be placed on hold.The device's memory: if your device is running low on memory, this can cause the call to be put on hold. It's important to note that WhatsApp uses the internet to make and receive calls, so if your connection is poor or unstable, you may experience issues like dropped calls or poor call quality. Try to use a stable and fast internet connection, and close other apps that may be using a significant amount of bandwidth to avoid interference.

Is it during composition, after composition, or a combination of during and after?","completion":"As a middle school student, my daughter was very fussy about the appearance of her assignments. They had to look…perfect. In her mind, “perfect” meant just like a magazine, with multiple columns, drop caps, text flowing around pictures and so on. Her teachers had things they wanted to see. The document had to be submitted in Word .doc or .docx format, with a certain font and size. And the document had to address each of the topics in the rubric, otherwise points would be deducted from her mark. Having tried to use Word for page layout, I foresaw problems. The time to do page layout is after the document had gone through many drafts concentrating on the words and pictures. Doing page layout while the text was still being edited meant continual fixing unfortunate page breaks, pictures on a different page from the text discussing them, and other gaps between “perfect” appearance and the current state of the document. As expected, tears were involved with each paper. She complained, why did Word make it so hard to look good? Every time, I helped her patch it up—only to spoil the moment by suggesting she delay page layout until after the document had gone through its last text review. Daughters can be quite stubborn when they have a clear idea of what the finished product should look like. Fortunately, she began deferring page layout after starting high school. The right way to format a document in Word is not to format it at all. Use the Styles feature instead. If you don’t like the appearance of something, edit the associated Style rather than applying individual format tweaks to each and every instance of something. I realize that making the Styles work for you is both more complex and time consuming than manually formatting. But you only have to edit those Styles once. For every other document you prepare using that template, you use the pre-edited Styles and the document looks consistent and perfect every time. “But I don’t use templates!” Well, that’s another problem. You are always using templates, even if it is only the Normal.dotm that you have been ignoring for years. If you want to create different kinds of documents (letters, memos, reports, etc.), each of them should use a different template so the new document inherits the previously edited Styles collection appropriate for that kind of document. Why fight Word by manually tweaking each instance of something? The more productive approach is to concentrate on the words and pictures, while using templates and Styles for all the formatting."},{"prompt":"any programmer ever been paid per line of code?","completion":"If they did they were employed by idiots."},{"prompt":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","completion":"The company had decided to fire a manager of the supply department.

What an idiot!"},{"prompt":"Why did DDay boats open in the front?","completion":"Because if they opened at the back or the sides everybody would fall out into deep water and drown. Incidentally they’re still made that way today for the same reasons. It’s the only way you can unload troops or cargo from a boat onto the beach: You may have watched the movie Saving Private Ryan and seen this scene where German MGs fired directly into the boats: That scene isn’t very accurate. First of all those are American Higgins boats, while the actual landing on that part of Omaha was made with Royal Navy Landing Craft Assault (LCA) boats. They’re similar enough that it’s not a big deal though. The real issue is that the view from an actual German MG bunker on Omaha Beach looked like this: They actually fired sideways along the beach, not down it. Any German gun positions facing out to sea like they were in the movie would have got plastered by Allied warships before the troops even landed. Instead they couldn’t easily be seen from the sea and when the troops got off the boats the fire would have been coming from the side, not in front. In fact, in many places the bullets would have been coming from both sides at once, which is obviously bad. The front ramp on the LCA was in exactly the right place to do its job. The problem the troops had wasn’t the boats, it was that they were making an opposed landing against a well dug in enemy and they all got dropped in a confused mess on the wrong part of the beach with no armoured support. That’s a tough day at the office for anyone."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","completion":"Sunday is the cheapest day of the week to check into a hotel. Travelers on a weekend getaway are returning home that day, and business travelers don’t usually start checking in until Monday, so there can be a lot of unused and discounted Sunday inventory. Usually the hotel website is cheaper,buy sometimes third party sites like [LINKED_TEXT: Booking.com ] [URL: https://www.booking.com/?aid=1671303]are cheaper . For some smaller, family run hotels I normally book around Munich the third party sites are cheaper when they only have a few rooms left. I imagine this is because at this point the family has reached an occupancy threshold to give them a profit and it's easier to let a third party fill the last few rooms (since they usually have a lot more reach) then try and do it themselves. Give them time to work on other things like maintenance, tending existing guests, renting bicycles, etc."},{"prompt":"Where can I buy Jack Daniels in Delhi (liquor store) apart from duty free shop at IGI airport?","completion":"Hey, dude, you can get it from any of the Liquor shops who is having Hard Liquor Licence.

Thus, we have seen the following top 5 Magento development trends in the year 2021: 1. Mobile commerce: Mobile commerce is the most important trend in e-commerce development. The rise of smartphones and tablet computers has allowed consumers to buy products and services at any time and from anywhere. The online shopping apps market is expected to grow in the next five years. 2. Cloud technology: The [LINKED_TEXT: cloud ] [URL: https://www.hnrtech.com/our-services/cloud-based-services/]is the future of online shopping because it offers most of the advantages of online and mobile commerce. 3. Demand forecasting: Demand forecasting is not the same as inventory forecasting. Demand forecasting is predicting the demand for a specific product by taking into consideration customers' reactions and past trends. 4. Artificial intelligence (AI): AI makes it possible to deliver a personalized shopping experience at scale. 5. Mobile-first design: Mobile-first design is the process of creating websites that are customized for handheld devices with smaller screens. Instead of creating different versions of websites, the mobile-first design allows the same site to be viewed in a variety of formats. What do you think will be the trend in 2021?

Obviously if the headphones are tight, then this is nothing to do with their noise cancelling capabilities necessarily. The constant hissing sound from some headphones such as the Beats Studios 2.0 irritates me because it just sounds strange - completely subjective. I find on ear headphones uncomfortable since I like to listen to music for long periods of time and they compress my ears too much. Movement of the cable can make the sound go a bit fuzzy which can be irritating but once again it is subjective and not all pairs of headphones do it."},{"prompt":"Every year, the top 5 mutual funds changes. How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?","completion":"Best in terms of what? Performance, portfolio allocation, fund manager expertise, expense ratio etc. So, there is no single answer to your question. Rather a better question could be- which are the best large cap mutual funds? which are the best long duration mutual funds? which are the best balanced advantage funds? Then you will get appropriate answers. For example, you cannot compare an equity fund with a debt fund. or you cannot compare a large cap fund with a small cap fund.

I know many! Following others - I keep telling people that everyone has a different method of studying. Some people can complete some topic within few hours which may take days for others. Also, people have their own way of preparing notes as well. The mistake we do is, asking how much time someone devoted to study or asking someone for notes. Prepare your own strategy and your own notes. Nothing else will help you as much as this.Mock tests/complex questions - I have seen people giving a lot of mock tests which is best way to practice your timing and online calculator. But the mistake we do is, running after complex questions. Online tests are designed that way so that students may get attracted towards any particular coaching center. So, your primary aim should be to practice your speed while giving mock. Don’t bother much about the marks.Short on confidence/lack of goal - If you want to prepare for GATE, first ask yourself whether that is what you really want. I have seen a lot of people leaving their preparations mid-way. That will do nothing good to you. So, it’s better that if you are boarding a ship, you sail it till the end. Also, be confident. Don’t let your past results affect your current preparation.Syllabus - You know the exact syllabus. Prepare your strategy so that you don’t miss out in any subject. If you have joined any particular coaching classes, it will take care of that. Otherwise, chart out the syllabus and prepare systematically. IF you are finding any particular topic difficult, leave that topic and move on. Don’t bother wasting time.Lack of discipline - Dedicate a fix amount of time. Make short goals according to syllabus and keep a track of it. If you are not able to do that, better join some coaching class.Over doing the preparation - Trust me, this happens. Once we are done with the syllabus, say, 4 months before the exam, we get bored and deviate our attention towards unwanted questions and syllabus. It’s better to start at right time and end it accordingly.Comparison - Stop comparing yourself with other students. Be positive and work on your own plan. Never get depressed by comparing your preparation with someone else. I will add more, when I remember.

It was already established that Isshiki can’t do that when he went to look for Kawaki the first time. So there are really only two possible explanations. Option 1: Isshiki touching Naruto who has his chakra linked to Kawaki’s prosthetic arm, which is touching Kawaki is a better chakra link than Isshiki having Karma seal implanted in Kawaki. Option 2: Teleporting people to himself takes a huge toll on Isshiki, so he wasn’t willing to do it then, but now he doesn’t have other option left than to just risk it. Well, there is, of course, the option 3, they forgot Isshiki can’t do that, but that’s just silly."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance? I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"Hi there, Being in contact with dancing professionals since a while now, i can say that people, who love dancing, are always doubtful of dancing as a career. Even the ones who are pursuing it and making an impact in the industry were doubtful in the initial stages of their journey. So, what is a good way to get started. I would say it starts with first figuring out - What specialisation of dance would you like to explore in the beginning, if you have an inclination for any particular field or if you are skilled in one. Else, start with the foundational courses and explore what resonates best with you. For the foundation, you can begin with exploring some academies such as shiamak davar’s, terence lewis’ , The danceworx (TDx), etc. Self-evaluate yourself each time you come out of any class as that’s what would keep you going and growing each day. Besides, you can be a professional dancer, choreographer, dance coach, or even a dance teacher. Opportunities are immense. All you need is the right mentoring to excel. Marrying your passion with the right wisdom is necessary to stay ahead. So, have some mentors from the start. My instagram page (id - edgenus_001) seeks to feature experts and achievers in the field of dance who have holistically provide the spectrum of ideas, as they come from different backgrounds.

Let me tell the amateur users of IMDb that the aggregate rating of 1–10 rating is not important as much it is important to check the number of votes/ratings. That aggregate pointer can go up or down at any moment on the basis of various factors not publicly revealed by IMDb yet. And according to the highest rated movie this way, a movie named Masaab from 2017 is the winner in India? But guess what, it has only 5 number of votes. So as you see, this is quite flawed. But Dil Bechara manages to be in number two position according to this sorting, which can still change any minute. Now let's compare it with the most voted Indian film - 3 Idiots from 2009. This movie has a whopping 329,305 number of votes, & counting. And based on this many count of votes, & being prone to an immense potential number of both positive & negative votes, the movie has still managed to maintain a 8.4 pointer rating. So according to this, 3 Idiots is still the highest rated Indian movie on IMDb with the most number of votes. And this system of sorting is more reliable & irreversible when it comes to judging the quality of movies. But does that mean, Dil Bechara did not break any records on IMDb? Not true. It did in fact break the biggest record in India. Up until now, there were only 6 movies, all of Aamir Khan's, & largely because of the interest from international audience & as a result of being listed in the Top 250 list, that have had a number of ratings above 100,000, slowly gathered over time. And out of the 14,000+ (Hindi only) movie titles on IMDb, only 20 in total have a rating above 60,000 votes, which itself is a rare thing. Compare that with 1800+ out of 442,000+ total movie titles that have a rating above 100,000, fortunately all ranging from 5–10 pointer ratings, but 98% of those movies are English. Now most of those ratings, in the case of Indian movies, are either gathered over time, or were increased after the movies were released in international markets. So you can see, Indian audience was not the most active market for IMDb. Because it's common for English movies to reach the mark of 100,000 easily if there is buzz, & even more easy if the movie is a big budget film. Even English movies released on Netflix are known to make such marks, sometimes within days. But everything has changed in the Indian scene since Dil Bechara released on Hotstar (free to watch title in India for the time being). For the records, it's the first movie to reach an unprecedented mark of 50,000 votes within just 24 hours. It is the first Indian movie to maintain a rating point above 9 even after being subject to a high number of votes. In fact, the numbers are increasing so rapidly that it just might be the fastest Indian movie to reach the mark of 100,000+ votes within just days, & still be able to maintain a rating above 9, which is itself a rare feat, even for an English movie. So, you see Dil Bechara broke the records on IMDb, just not in the way you thought, but in fact, in a much more exclusive & exemplary way. This shows that, if there is enough love & motivation, even Indians can promote good Indian movies with high ratings, & create international buzz & bring attention to the art of our country, & remove the stigma attached to the craft of our country. We, being the second largest movie makers by revenue & the first by number, never managed to break such international records before. Vote brigading or not, let's not stop here, especially for great movies. If Americans can do it, we can do it too. And by the way, Dil Bechara has managed to break records on YouTube too. First, it became the most liked trailer in the world, beating the record of even mammoths like Avengers Endgame. Avengers Endgame (3M likes ratio to a viewership of 136M). Dil Bechara (10M likes ratio to a viewership of a common 81M). Even the songs broke many records in India. Such is the tribute & love for the late star, Sushant Singh Rajput. This is truly rare & unprecedented, even compared to some of the biggest names in the past. It's truly awe-inspiring to see this happen. Let's maintain this josh in the future too."},{"prompt":"What do you think are the main advantages and disadvantages of teaching with technologies?","completion":"The main advantages of teaching with technologies are that it promotes learning, enables the students to be more engaged and focused, and helps them to be more active during the class. These three things are what make me think that teaching with technology is a better alternative than teaching without it. If you ask me though, the main disadvantages of teaching with technologies are that they can be distracting for the students. If a student is not paying attention, they may get distracted by the device and their focus will be broken. Another disadvantage would be that teachers have to change their way of teaching because of the new technology. For example, if you have been using slides for your presentation and now you have an app for it, you might have to make some adjustments so that everything still looks like it did before but now does not require that much effort from your part since everything is already done for you!"},{"prompt":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","completion":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave? In a manner of speaking. As a couple of other people have noted, having good tenants is worth far, far more than a couple hundred bucks a month. I own my own home now, but when I last rented my landlord only raised the rent when her own costs went up. Hey, costs go up. It happens. But she didn’t take the opportunity to do an additional markup. Made us want to stay, and made us want to keep her liking us. Contrast this to the consequences of what happened to our landlord before that. My wife and I were excellent tenants. We paid on time every month, and in the 2 years that we lived there, we called upon them a total of 2 times. We took care of the place as good - or better - than if it were out own. At the 60-day-before-the-renewal date (as required by state law), I got a letter saying that they were going to raise the rent by around 20%. This wound up being another 500/mo. I don’t know about you, but an extra 500/month is not trivial to me. I certainly didn’t get a 500/month raise from work. So, naturally, I wanted to know 1) what was the reason, and 2) what we might be ‘getting’ as a result of the higher price. I was actually afraid for a moment that, somehow, we had offended or done something to anger the landlords. I genuinely was concerned that they were holding something against us about which we did not know. Instead, she told me that there was no other reason to raising the rent, other than the fact that she thought she could get it. She thought that she was losing money that she could have been getting. Reminds me of Aesop’s Fables: [LINKED_TEXT: The Dog and Its Reflection - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dog_and_Its_Reflection] Mind you, in the 2 years we had lived there, we had not cost her a single penny. She was, effectively, getting more than her mortgage cost, complete with a healthy profit. As to the second question, no, there would be no other benefits to living in their house. I couldn’t really understand it. The logic was truly weird to me: Even if she managed to find other tenants right away, she would still need to clean and prep the house - which takes about a month. So, that was 2500 out of her pocket (or, to put it into perspective, 5 months of the additional rent that she wanted). If she couldn’t get it occupied right away, she could have eaten away an entire year of that additional profit in less than 3 months. In other words, in the best case scenario, she wouldn’t see a dime of additional money until the 6th month of getting rent. Nevertheless, there was no benefit for us staying, so, we told her that we would be moving. She was absolutely shocked. Sure enough, we set about trying to find another place, and found an even better location, with a better house, with better landlords, for a better place. Sometimes the stars actually do align. Nevertheless, since the house was still on my way to work, I could see that the house remained unoccupied for about 2.5 months (the math is left up as an exercise to the reader as to how much it cost her). I’m a big believer that life provides its own epilogues. Unfortunately, USPS wasn’t all that great in remembering that we had moved, so I had to go back to the house about 3 months after we moved, in order to find and retrieve a parcel that was supposed to come to me. The new tenants (3 college fraternity brothers), invited me into the house while they went and searched for my package. They had been in the house for about, oh, 2 to 3 weeks. The house was trashed. In less than a month, they had punched holes in the walls, stained the beautiful off-white carpets, chipped the stonework around the fireplace, and cracked the kitchen tile. I’m no contractor, but if I had to hazard a guess, they probably made close to 10k in damage to be brought back to full repair. In less than a month. We had gotten 100% of our deposit back. There was no way the deposit for these guys was going to begin to cover the damage that they had already done. As I stood in the kitchen, all I could think about was how this was going to need a lawsuit to resolve. (Note: this had been my home for 2 years. I’m not going to lie - for all the work that my wife and I did, all the care and protection for the house, to be destroyed so wantonly… well, it was sad. It was almost as if we shouldn’t have bothered, except those aren’t the kind of people we are. I couldn’t help but feel like these guys had not just trashed the landlord’s home, but mine as well. I didn’t say anything, though, as I didn’t feel it was my place.) Ultimately, she not only lost the money that she would have received for that 2.5 months (let’s say it was over 6000 of rent, to make the numbers easy), but then had to suffer the issues and indignities related to paying for repair of her house. What’s even sadder is that it was her late father’s house, not just an investment, and she held an emotional bond with it herself. There is something to be said about priorities, not to mention risks and costs. So, a little off topic from the original question, perhaps, but a cautionary tale nevertheless. Thing is, if she had only marginally increased the rent, we probably would have stayed. Given how callously she regarded our value, however, that would not likely have been in our best interest. We could have probably been like this guy: [LINKED_TEXT: Boiling frog - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog] So, a tip to renters: know your value. Always keep an eye on the market, have areas to which you can move if you wind up in a situation where the landlord wishes to bump up your rent unreasonably. Many, many landlords are aware of just how valuable good renters are, and will bend over backwards to keep them. Obviously, not all of them are. But make sure that you are exchanging that value fairly, and be ready to walk when they aren’t."},{"prompt":"What is it like being a farmer?

I am missing my Mom , So i would describe her day .

It is a complex process that involves a number of factors, including the following: Timeliness: Newsworthiness is often determined by how timely a story is. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that are happening right now or that have just happened.Impact: Newsworthiness is also determined by the impact a story is likely to have. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that are likely to affect a large number of people or that are likely to have a significant impact on the world.Interest: Newsworthiness is also determined by the interest of the audience. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that are likely to interest their readers or viewers.Conflict: Newsworthiness is also often determined by conflict. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that involve conflict, such as wars, natural disasters, or political scandals. News gathering and processing in print and broadcast journalism are both challenging and rewarding. There are a number of opportunities and obstacles that journalists face in both mediums. Opportunities: Speed: Print and broadcast journalists have the opportunity to report on news quickly. This is especially true for broadcast journalists, who can use television and radio to reach a large audience in real time.Reach: Print and broadcast journalists have the opportunity to reach a large audience. This is because print newspapers and broadcast news programs are available to people all over the world.Impact: Print and broadcast journalists have the opportunity to have a significant impact on the world. This is because they can report on stories that can inform and educate the public and that can lead to positive change. Obstacles: Cost: Print and broadcast journalism can be expensive. This is because it requires the purchase of equipment, the hiring of staff, and the production of content.Time constraints: Print and broadcast journalists are often under time constraints. This is because they need to report on news quickly and efficiently.Bias: Print and broadcast journalists can be biased in their reporting. This is because they are human and they can be influenced by their own personal opinions and beliefs. Despite the challenges, print and broadcast journalism are still important mediums for news gathering and processing. They provide a vital service to the public by keeping them informed about current events. In addition to the opportunities and obstacles mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can influence the news judgment of journalists. These include the following: The editorial policies of the news organization: Each news organization has its own editorial policies, which dictate what stories are considered newsworthy. These policies can vary from organization to organization.The personal biases of the journalist: Journalists are human beings, and they have their own personal biases. These biases can sometimes influence the stories that they choose to report on.The pressure to publish: Journalists are often under pressure to publish stories quickly, which can sometimes lead to mistakes.The availability of information: Journalists are only able to report on stories that they have information about. If they do not have enough information about a story, they may not be able to report on it. News judgment is a complex process that is influenced by a number of factors. It is important for journalists to be aware of these factors and to be transparent about their news judgment."},{"prompt":"there a reason, other than cost, to not use GFCI outlets in all outlets, rather than just kitchen and bath?","completion":"One reason is the NEC doesn't require them everywhere.

Most of the small good institute based on offline classes are totally closed due to COVID Pandemic. So some of my friends started with top institutes like AAKASH, ALLEN, MOTION, etc. Unfortunately, most big-brand institutes simply dupe students by providing Prerecorded VIDEO Classes only, No teacher provided for coaching. One of my friends recommends IG Career Institute in Kolkata-700118. I was not aware of IG Career Institute at that time. So I talked with them about the class and my friends started taking the class. The class was very good and my friends were highly satisfied. Online class was taken by the best faculties. Every class is well planned. IG Career Institute also provides pre-recorded video classes as a backup. After every class 1:5, teacher-student interaction removes any doubt regarding a topic that discusses in that class. IG Career Institute provides online test series for weekly module tests, Full tests, etc which is very helpful for students. My friends also took NEET online test series from Allen, but they are personally more satisfied with the IG Career Institute test series because every question is very near to the NEET question pattern and helps you revised the CBSE course curriculum more effectively.

I don’t believe most gun control works; universal background checks, one gun a month, waiting a week or 10 days, banning semi-auto rifles, limiting magazine size to lower than standard capacities, safe storage penalties. I don’t think it does much. What happens after this has been enforced for a few years and a crazy person shoots up the place or gun violence doesn’t fall through the floor. The Gun Safety people are going to have to latch onto some other gimmick, and that gimmick is going to be some sort of gun ban. All the policies I mentioned above will limit or dimish legal domestic gun ownership. I’ve lived in two states that border each other, Virginia and Maryland. Maryland has had some of the strictest gun control in the nation for years, Virginia has had little gun control. It is so painful for a person to buy a gun in Maryland, some don’t You need to get a background check, fill out a form, take a class, wait for your MDHQL (License) to arrive, then take your license and go buy your gun, You then wait 7 business days after filling out both state and federal forms, and getting charged , the same background check used to get your MDHQL is re-run by the gun store. 7 business days later your drive back to the gun shop and pick up your gun. In Virginia, you fill out a form, they run the same background check Maryland does, and give you the gun, usually within an hour. The moral of the story is that Maryland has made the act of purchasing a firearm so difficult some people don’t bother. Worse, with Virginia having almost no gun control except for the background check you’d think blood would be running in the streets, apparently not.

Also, it's equally budget-friendly! especially if you use WordPress to do it. Did you know that almost one-third of all websites are powered by WordPress? If you've never built a website before, don't worry. I'll walk you through the procedure in this short article, and it'll go very smoothly. Step 1: Choose a hosting Provider. An important choice for the well-being of your website or blog is selecting a hosting provider. It can determine whether or not your website will be fast, secure, and always accessible. You should base your choice on the following main points of view: Hosting service for WordPress was optimized for it: Make sure the hosting plan you select is ideal for WordPress if you intend to build your website with this platform. It will ensure that features like 1-click WordPress installation, automatic updates, uptime tracking plugins, and more are available. Speed of hosting: Your website or blog should load quickly so that visitors don't have to wait. For the best performance, look for the most recent technologies, such as SSDs, the most recent PHP version, and pre-installed [LINKED_TEXT: LiteSpeed cache plugins.] [URL: https://www.litespeedtech.com/] Price of hosting: Because there is so much competition in the market, you don't have to choose the most expensive provider to get the best hosting. [LINKED_TEXT: WordPress hosting plans are available from Hostinger for just 1,99 per month.] [URL: https://www.hostg.xyz/SHCi8] Hosting uptime of 99,99%: If you want your website to be up and running constantly, this step is crucial. Check the status reports and other signs to see if the hosting company keeps its promise. Excellent customer support: This step is most important to beginners, but even if you are a professional, customer support may be able to assist you in resolving some more challenging problems. Ensure that they have a WordPress-focused team. Step 2. Choose a domain name. The domain name is the name of your website, You can find the domain name in the search bar. For a domain name, you can be creative and use any word you like, but it works best if you use a word or a word combination that is closely related to the name of your blog or company. Make sure it's short and memorable so that visitors to your website can easily remember it. Here are some of the top website or blog name generators in case you're stuck for guidance. You are free to choose any domain name extension you like. However, .com, .net, and [LINKED_TEXT: .org] [URL: http://and.org/] are the most widely used extensions. Typically, domain names cost 10–15 per year. I advise getting a domain name along with your hosting package so you might [LINKED_TEXT: get one for free for a year!] [URL: https://www.hostg.xyz/SHCi8] Step3- Install WordPress You can install WordPress and begin editing your blog once you've arranged for a domain name and hosting package. Remember to complete all the required fields in your hosting and domain accounts. If you don't register the domain name immediately after purchasing it, otherwise, someone else might get it first. Once you're finished, you can quickly install WordPress in your hosting dashboard with a single click. Step 4-Pick a WordPress theme You can save yourself some valuable time by using a WordPress theme, which will have the entire website and design planned out for you. Customizing it will be the only thing you need to do. Before beginning anything, some people try to choose the best theme for hours or even days. Don't overthink your choice; you just need something simple to get going. I recommend selecting something helpful but not overwhelming. Don't be afraid to experiment because you won't know what your visitors will like before they visit your website. Try the [LINKED_TEXT: OceanWP theme] [URL: https://wordpress.org/themes/oceanwp/] if you're having trouble finding something that works for your needs. Both a blog and a personal website can use this trendy and useful theme. Here is a [LINKED_TEXT: comprehensive list] [URL: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/best-wordpress-blog-themes] of the best WordPress themes, both paid and unpaid, in case that isn't to your taste. With WordPress, changing or installing a theme is very simple. Just log in and go to the appearance section, themes, and add new. Step 5: Customize your website unique. One of the most exciting aspects of building a website is by far customizing your blog or website. You can add all the necessary components and pages, change the layout, and add a menu bar. Some themes may not even need customizations; all you need to do is install a specific plugin to get everything you want. You can also begin to (or continue to) design your website. It's a good idea if you have specific ideas for how your website should look, it's a good time for implementing them. Step-6. Add the content. Once everything is set up, you can begin adding your original content to your website. You can include pictures, textual descriptions, blog posts, or anything else you like. Your writing should be highly appealing and audience-specific. I am aware that perfecting it takes time, but it is completely worthwhile. Make your content different from the rest since there is already a lot available. Step 7- Optimize your website It's time to optimize your website once you're done with the setup. Running a test through [LINKED_TEXT: GTmetrix ] [URL: https://gtmetrix.com/]as a starting point will show you what needs to be improved. You can do a few simple things, such as: optimizing the images on your websites;enabling caching;minimizing the size of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Bonus advice Don't forget to [LINKED_TEXT: install an SSL certificate] [URL: https://www.hostg.xyz/SHCi8] on your domain before publishing your website. Within your hosting panel, you can do that.

Is this true?","completion":"A lot of socialist ideas have already been implemented in the United States (many by Republicans), and there’s a few other such ideas that probably should be (universal healthcare, strengthened safety nets, increased investment in education). Most Bernie Sanders supporters, including myself, were of a mind that he’d bring these to pass if it was at all in his power to do so. We supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton precisely because she does not have his track record for making left-swinging changes. I’m satisfied that HRC won’t swing the country to the right (which I feel would be a mistake right now, we’re already extremely right-wing on the political spectrum internationally), but I don’t think she’s going to swing it much to the left, either. She will be a good and competent administrator. I think her presidency will be remembered as a time when everyone just kinda chilled the f*ck out. She also has a long political history and will be able to more effectively reach across the aisle, so to speak. I expect she’ll be able to break up the deadlock a bit. Things should settle down and settle in. It’ll be boring, but productive and, in general, a time of national healing after some turbulence (that made us better)."},{"prompt":"Are NRA members proud that legally owned guns are used in school mass shootings?","completion":"No legally owned gun has been used to commit a school shooting. Most of the time the shooter was too young to possess the firearm and it was therefore considered stolen.

It is a prosecutorial document. As such, it contains or presents one side. If prosecutorial documents were considered to represent the full truth, then there is no need for an accused to receive a trial and other due process. In both our legal system and in critical thinking, full truth requires investigation and exposition of more than one side. Thus observe that in the investigation and the Report that witnesses were not cross-examined by adversary council - that is adversary to the DOJ questioners and their agenda. There is almost 100% certainty that exculpatory evidence exists that is not included the Report. There are no competing theories presented or argued to account for alleged action or motives of those involved, nor additional evidence presented to support those theories. Thus, even if every alleged and so-called fact in the Report is verifiable and correct, that in no way or in any imaginable scenario means the Mueller Report contains or represents the full truth. To reach this obvious conclusion it is irrelevant which side of the political isle or argument one is on. Moreover, many of the legal and evidentiary conclusions being promulgated by many of the Democrats in Congress and elsewhere are therefore utterly preposterous and unfounded - and as such merely represent their further continued descent into depraved disregard for the principles of Anglo-American due process in pursuit of their political agenda."},{"prompt":"Why has Labour lost its fourth general election in a row?","completion":"Lost the plot, in denial, dismissive of reality and totally out of touch."},{"prompt":"Why don’t carbon monoxide detectors alert to natural gas leaks, when gas leaks can cause carbon monoxide poisoning?","completion":"Natural gas leaks don’t cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

People have been breeding large dogs for centuries, and there are many breeds that are considered large. However, compared to some of the largest wild cats such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, these dogs are not considered to be “big” in the same way. This begs the question, why are there no big dogs? To answer this, it is important to look at the evolutionary history of both cats and dogs. Cats and dogs both evolved from ancient carnivorous mammals. Cats evolved from the Felidae family, while dogs evolved from the Canidae family. Though they share similarities, cats and dogs have distinct differences in their evolutionary history and development. Cats are considered to be apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. This led to the development of cats being solitary hunters and having a natural instinct to protect themselves from danger. Cats also evolved to have longer bodies, larger heads, and powerful claws for hunting prey. Their agility, strength, and stealth are unmatched in the animal kingdom. This allowed cats to evolve into larger species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, to better hunt their prey. Dogs, on the other hand, evolved from a pack-based hunter and scavenger lifestyle. Dogs’ survival depended on their ability to work together in a group and hunt or scavenge whatever food they could find. This led to the development of dogs having shorter bodies, smaller heads, and weaker claws for scavenging. Dogs are not considered to be apex predators, and therefore have not evolved into larger species like cats have. In addition, the domestication of dogs has also played a role in the lack of large dogs. Cats were domesticated much later than dogs, and their domestication has not altered their natural predatory instincts as much as it has with dogs. Dogs, on the other hand, have been domesticated for thousands of years and have developed a close relationship with humans. This has led to the selective breeding of dogs to be smaller and less aggressive, and has eliminated any natural instinct to survive without human help. The combination of evolutionary history and domestication has led to the lack of large breeds of dogs. Cats were able to evolve into larger species due to their natural predatory instincts, while dogs were bred to be smaller and less aggressive due to their domestication. Therefore, when it comes to large or “big” dogs, there are simply none that exist today. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

However, here are some contributing factors that are often cited: 1. Social media: The rise of social media has made it easier for individuals to compare themselves to others and feel a sense of inadequacy. Constant exposure to social media can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. 2. High-pressure environment: Today's society places a high value on academic and professional success, resulting in an increased workload and pressure to achieve. This can lead to burnout, stress, and depression. 3. Financial instability: Economic instability can contribute to a sense of hopelessness and increased levels of anxiety and depression, especially for young adults entering the workforce. 4. Lack of social support: With the shift towards an individualistic society, social support structures have weakened. This can result in feelings of isolation, which can increase the risk of depression. 5. Trauma: People in this generation experience a range of traumatic events, from exposure to violence and conflict to increased natural disasters. This can have long-term effects on mental health."},{"prompt":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

While they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. Composition: Granite is an igneous rock composed of minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock that forms from limestone under high pressure and heat. Hardness: Granite is harder than marble and is therefore more durable and less likely to scratch or chip. Marble is softer and more susceptible to damage. Appearance: Granite typically has a speckled or granular appearance, with a range of colors from light to dark. Marble has a more veined appearance, with swirling patterns in a variety of colors. Maintenance: Granite is relatively low maintenance and requires only regular cleaning with a mild detergent. Marble, however, is more prone to staining and requires more careful cleaning and maintenance. Cost: Granite is generally less expensive than marble, though the cost can vary depending on the quality and rarity of the stone. Overall, the choice between granite and marble depends on personal preference, budget, and the intended use of the stone. Granite is a good choice for high-traffic areas such as kitchen countertops, while marble is often used for decorative purposes such as flooring or sculptures."},{"prompt":"What is the worst service experience from a five star hotel?","completion":"The worst service experience I ever had from a five star hotel was when I stayed at one in the Caribbean.

It's important to nourish your body with a variety of delicious and healthy foods. Fill your plate with colorful fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like chicken or fish, and whole grains such as brown rice or quinoa. These choices provide essential nutrients and can help keep your blood sugar stable.Remember that portion control plays a significant role. It's not about depriving yourself but rather enjoying your favorite foods in moderation. By paying attention to portion sizes, you can savor the flavors you love while keeping your blood sugar levels in check.I encourage you to explore low glycemic index (GI) foods. These include foods like sweet potatoes, lentils, and leafy greens. They are digested more slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar instead of sudden spikes. Incorporating these foods into your meals can help you maintain more stable blood sugar levels throughout the day.Let's make a conscious effort to reduce sugary beverages in your routine. Swap out sodas or sugary juices for refreshing options like infused water, unsweetened tea, or sparkling water with a slice of lemon or cucumber. By cutting back on sugary drinks, you can better manage your blood sugar and promote overall health.Fiber is your friend when it comes to blood sugar control. Incorporate high-fiber foods into your diet, such as whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and legumes. Fiber slows down the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, helping to prevent sharp spikes and maintaining a more balanced blood sugar level.Let's get moving! Regular physical activity not only helps manage blood sugar levels but also improves your overall well-being. Find activities you enjoy, whether it's taking a brisk walk, dancing, swimming, or playing a sport. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, and remember to include strength training exercises to keep your body strong.Managing stress is an essential part of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Find activities that help you relax and unwind, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy. Taking care of your mental and emotional well-being can positively impact your blood sugar control.Prioritize a good night's sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Lack of sleep can disrupt your body's insulin sensitivity and affect your blood sugar levels. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine and create a comfortable sleep environment to promote restful sleep.If you have diabetes, closely monitoring your carbohydrate intake can be beneficial. Work with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, who can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrates to include in your meals and snacks.Lastly, always follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding medications and treatments for blood sugar control. They are there to support you and provide guidance specific to your needs. Personal recommendation : [LINKED_TEXT: Ground-breaking Blood Sugar and Sleep Support] [URL: https://0e8757q76vfva5ufmhsbwg3-46.hop.clickbank.net/] Remember, you're not alone on this journey.

Do what you say you are going to do. If you promise something, work hard to deliver it, on time, and if you can’t - communicate clearly your progress and barriers to achieving the goal 2. Be tenacious - don’t let difficult tasks slip, or procrastinate, if the task isn’t exciting. Managers value staff who can tackle difficult tasks. 3. Be creative - If the obvious approach to solving a problem isn’t working, look for alternate, even unusual or creative approaches. 4. Bite off more than you can chew (within reason). Be prepared to tackle the hard tasks. Don’t be afraid to enlist the advice and help of others around the organisation - usually your friends and colleagues want you to succeed. 5. Be humble. Don’t make a big deal of your accomplishments, let them speak for themselves. 6. Build your network. The more relationships you have with subject matter experts and people of influence, and in senior positions, the greater your own influence and effectiveness becomes. 7. Be patient. You will achieve strong advancement if you follow these principles, but not in a week or a month - you need to apply yourself over time and you will be recognised. 8. Don’t burn bridges. If you take a flame thrower to bridges when solving problems, you’ll end up staring blankly at large canyons, longing for the other side. 9. Build your skills. Try to become the subject matter expert in whatever field you are focused on - read, read, read, investigate, experiment.

The real figure for last year is not released yet. It is expected Bangladesh growth rate will be at least 3% bigger. That means Bangladesh is, in fact, richer than data shows. The growth of Bangladesh is expected to be double-digit.

Pakistan is a heavily indebted country and a big part of its GDP as interest. The foreign reserve of Pakistan is half of Bangladesh. The life expectancy and literacy rate is much better in Bangladesh than Pakistan. Only one sector, Pakistan is more successful than Bangladesh is IT sector. Pakistan exports 5 Billion USD in this sector whereas Bangladesh exports less than a billion.

If you are orbiting the Earth at 250 miles up, traveling at 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h), and you throw a baseball toward the Earth, what will happen to the baseball? 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h) is the speed you must travel at 250 miles up to maintain an orbit around Earth. An average person can throw a baseball at approximately [LINKED_TEXT: 25 miles per hour] [URL: https://www.cgaa.org/articles/how-fast-can-an-average-person-throw-a-baseball]. However, different people have different throwing speeds. Since Earth is the target and it’s 250 miles away, it would take an object 600 minutes, or 10 hours to travel 250 miles. Meanwhile, every 90 minutes, the baseball will completely orbit the Earth, miss the Earth, and go around for another try. Essentially, the baseball will enter into an elliptical orbit around Earth and never hit the ground until the very thin atmosphere at 250 miles altitude slows the baseball enough that it de-orbits and enters the atmosphere, and this could take many months. The reason the baseball never reaches the Earth is that the baseball still has a forward velocity of 17,500 mph relative to the Earth's gravity, and as a result, it will follow a curved path around the planet. Let’s say you’re an astronaut who is the best baseball pitcher in the world. Assuming that you are traveling at 17,500 mph relative to the Earth when you throw the baseball, and the baseball is thrown in the opposite direction to the spacecraft's forward momentum at a velocity of 17,500 mph relative to the astronaut, the baseball's velocity relative to the Earth would be zero. In this case, the baseball would not have any forward velocity relative to the Earth, and it would fall towards the planet due to the force of gravity. The baseball would likely burn up in the Earth's atmosphere during re-entry, but it would not remain in orbit around the Earth."},{"prompt":"Do you believe the claim that Gavin Menzies makes in his book “1421: The Year China Discovered America” that Admiral Zheng voyaged to the Americas before European explorers?","completion":"Well, ther is this: [LINKED_TEXT: NEW STUDY OF ANCHOR STONES REBUTS CHINA ORIGIN THEORY (Published 1982)A California historian has challenged a theory that stone anchors found off the coast of California were dropped by ships carrying explorers from China years before Columbus discovered America.

Soldiers used to frequently take artifacts from the enemy and use them in battle or even keep them as mementos. Small weapons, flags, and other significant personal items are examples of such items. We want to know if this practice is still being used today. Do soldiers thus take enemy weapons? Even when they are running low on ammunition, most soldiers stay away from hostile weaponry. They run the danger of not knowing if the opposition is using it as an offensive tactic. Similarly to this, if a soldier is untrained in using an enemy weapon, there may be little sense in picking it up. Therefore, the army discourages its service members from considering the employment of enemy weaponry for safety grounds in order to protect their soldiers. In this article, we examine military tactics to see if combat medals are becoming obsolete. Are soldiers permitted to use enemy weaponry when engaged in combat? Can they keep them as mementos and what are the rules? You can learn the answers to these and other questions by reading on. Can Soldiers Pick Up Enemy Weapons? In some situations, a soldier's final resort can be to take an enemy weapon in hand. Other times, such as in guerilla warfare, the situation is so critical that the soldier's ammunition choice is the last thing on his or her mind. Depending on how conventional the army is and it's fighting regulations, different laws apply in this circumstance. One of the rules in this situation is that the soldier may take whatever appropriate action as long as it doesn't jeopardize the security of their squad. However, these regulations are set by the Special Forces and the relevant fighting units. In conflict, it's generally not a good idea for soldiers to use the enemy's weapons, and some strict warriors won't even think about it when they're out of ammunition. Some people even believe that leaving a weapon that can be used around for their adversary to find and use against them is a sign of weakness. Similar to this, what good is taking up a weapon if it can only be used by the correct hands? Find out why it's not a smart idea to use your opponent's weapon. Level of Training Before engaging in combat, every soldier goes through specialized training that is tailored specifically to the kind of weapon they will employ. Consequently, it is useless for them to pick up a weapon for which they have no training. If they use it in any other way, it might seriously harm them or their fellow soldiers. Since many soldiers have died from these weapons because they were used incorrectly, it is recommended to stay away from opposing weapons. In addition, several weapons self-destruct if a foreigner attempts to use them. For instance, a soldier might take out the bolt, reveal the pin, insert it into the hole, and then snap it off to completely incapacitate the gun for the subsequent user. Sabotage Tactics The battlefield can be fairly challenging because you never know what strategy your adversary will use to corner you. First, the opposing side might grab their weapons and sabotage or rig them; as a result, the weapon might malfunction or blow up when it is fired. In addition to jamming adjacent weapons, this tampered ammunition may also render your troops defenseless. One approach to sneak into the enemy's camp is to leave modified weapons lying around. Therefore, the majority of soldiers choose to employ their own artillery. Friendly Fire Some firearms may sound the same when fired, as you may have noticed. For instance, the M-4 and AK-47 both have similar sounds. A soldier should therefore stick to their own weapon if both sides are using these weapons. If not, they might be making themselves a target for both sides, which would be a self-defeating strategy. Safety Before deciding to take an enemy's weapon, safety must come first. Every soldier is aware that there are a few things to take into account before approving a firearm for usage. They must be able to disassemble, clean, and reassemble it. By doing this, you can be sure that the gun is secure and hasn't been rigged or booby-trapped. In addition, the soldier's gun is probably in the crossfire given that they are down. As a result, if it is also struck, it could be destroyed or have its barrel twisted, which would affect the shot's accuracy. Such a weapon is dangerous to anyone utilizing it because it has a high risk of exploding, especially under back pressure. Can Soldiers Keep Captured Weapons? Which nation a soldier is fighting for determines whether they are allowed to keep the weapons they have taken. Countries like the US have severe laws that ban soldiers from keeping guns they have taken and compel them to return any weapons they have taken to their unit. Weapons and personal belongings are among the goods that are kept as a tradition in armed conflict. The successful side or the battle hero benefited from this tactic. It was a display of bravery and a blatant sign of the victorious side in the conflict. The soldiers may still value this highly; hence, they may want to keep enemy weaponry as mementos. But is it permitted by law? Generally speaking, different nations and combat units have their own laws regarding the retention of looted enemy property. When a team seizes a weapon, it may be treated as a war prize in some nations. After labeling them, the appropriate authorities seize them and put them on display. Each firearm receives a designation based on the method of capture. Heavy armament, such as trucks, ships, and airplanes, are subject to this practice. For smaller ammunition, such as rifles and pistols, however, they take them and put them on exhibit in other institutions. However, according to US practice, any time a soldier finds an enemy weapon, they must give it back to their squad. It will be properly disposed of by the parties involved; they will either destroy it or render it inoperable. They break the receiver and remove the bolt from small-caliber weapons like pistols and firearms, rendering the weapon utterly worthless. Larger weapons are destroyed by explosions or airstrikes if they are there. Their primary worry is that the adversary might find them again and use the weapons against them. If they are destroyed, the enemy cannot take them back. The legislation is fairly strict in forbidding soldiers from seizing and keeping enemy weaponry, either for use or as a memento. The best course of action is to declare that you are in possession of it and then provide it to the appropriate persons for disposal. The idea is that since a soldier fights for their country, anything he acquires or captures during the conflict belongs to it. The leaders of the unit will choose the next course of action with regard to the weapons, captives, or the land. If a soldier still chooses to keep enemy weapons, it would be against the law and punishable. They can only keep such a weapon by keeping it illegally, which is strongly advised against. Finally The wisest course of action would be to refrain from picking up or using any enemy weapons at all; yet, some soldiers believe it to be an essential action in battle. Many veterans of past wars, such as the world War, admit to picking up enemy ammunition during altercations. They even claim that it was a smart approach that might have helped them win the battles. Due to their scarcity, it was necessary to seize these weapons, which also increased their ammunition supply. However, if the army is organized and well-supplied, its own artillery will be sufficient. The US Constitution forbids the storage of firearms belonging to enemies. It is therefore advisable to stay away from it; else, soldiers will be doing If you liked the answer Upvote and Follow"},{"prompt":"What are the most underrated cities in the U.S.?","completion":"Underrated?

Setting up your goals is very important because it keeps you on track every time you reminisce about your writing journey. Be Yourself Each and every writer has his or her own fingerprint when they write and you should not try to write as someone else. Always keep in mind that what works for you is different from what works for your role model. Try finding your own writing method using your instinct as your guiding compass and with time your mind will create a universe just for you where you can create whatever you want.

Depends on your perspective. Let’s take it from the humble beginnings of Russia some thousand years ago and see how it went. Case 1 A bunch of Scandinavians made a technological breakthrough that allowed them to speedily build boats that could navigate both shallow river courses and rough seas. That allowed them access to an abundant source of slaves in the far forests of Eastern Europe whom they then brought to rich markets in the Roman Empire and beyond. In a matter of a century, Kievan Rus surged out of nowhere as the largest—and possibly richest—kingdom north of Constantinople. Was it a curse? Not for the guys who ruled the place and their customers. And us, who inherited this place and its legends. Case 2 In the beginning of the 13th century, the Crusaders busted the Roman Empire. Overnight, our giant market in the south disappeared. Rus lands, already fractured into dozens of competing fiefdoms, found themselves impoverished because the Mediterranean trade was our only source of wealth. We had to use glass beads and exotic shells for money. Rus lands—easily and mostly by our own volition— became a dull backwater of the Golden Horde. Curse as promised? Sure. Case 3 Over a couple of centuries, we became good business partners with the Turks along the Volga river who took over the Chingizide Empire. That allowed us to earn good money selling furs and other valuable things that were abundant in our forests. The world headed into the Little Ice Age. People were throwing money at our merchants. Rulers of Muscovy knew how to pick that money and use it for important government business. In the 16th century, we gobbled up the shards of the Chingizide empire and started our epic slow march toward the Pacific and southward to the Silk Road. We became the largest land on Earth. Our territory and riches hidden beneath it are a legacy from that time. Was it a curse? Indigenous locals might agree. But certainly not a curse for us. Case 4 Some hundred years ago, a small group of Marxists grabbed power in what was left after the collapsed Russian Empire. A devastating Civil War followed. Pigheaded attempts to implement the Marxian 10-point Action Plan from the Communist Manifesto made us a continent-sized smoldering ruin. But eight blessed years of market-based “new economic policy” followed. Timid Capitalism soon put us back on our feet. And then in the 1930s Stalin shrewdly got our Western enemies to put together for us the greatest military-industrial machine the world had seen. This won us WW2 and later made us a space-age nuclear superpower. How did we do it? We threw a whopping mass of resources on the task, all our own. A curse? Heck no. Case 5 In the 1980s, international petroleum markets imploded. Since exported oil and gas were the life source for the hugely ineffective Soviet machine, the USSR imploded soon after. We lost the Cold War. Our mighty country was torn apart into 15 different states, several at war with each other and themselves. Misery, chaos, and humiliation followed for millions and millions of us. Looks exactly like a curse to me. Case 6 At the turn of the century, things looked bleak for Russia. But suddenly, the international commodity markets surged into the stratosphere. The world was again throwing money at us. Again! And our new confident ruler with solid KGB credentials knew how to pick that money and put it to serious government business. What was new, he allowed much of this windfall of riches to rain on us, mere commoners. That was an era of unseen prosperity and peace for millions and millions of Russians. Our beloved President made a solid claim to become the best ruler of Russia, ever. Could he pull this off without oil and gas and the rest of the stuff we chop down, dig up, pump over, and sell to the world? Nope. Some Russians may call our President a curse. But for the generation of Soviet old-timers like me, this was a blessing. Below, a symbolic scene from downtown Moscow. A big statue of Rus duke Vladimir who together with his Varangian guard baptized our country “with fire and sword” stands right outside the Kremlin. You see a shining red star on one of the Kremlin’s towers above his head. This illustrates the 3D vision we practice in Russia on curses and blessings. In our mind, the red pentagram of belligerent atheists, internationalists, and haters of historical Russia goes perfectly fine with Orthodox piety, imperial past, and defiant nationalism. At any given moment, we pick whatever works.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","completion":"Here’s an answer from the flip side. I wasn’t originally going to answer this question but I read some of the responses and wanted to give the child’s perspective on what it’s like for a parent to request a paternity test. My mother divorced my biological father when I was two years old, back in 2003. She tried to get full custody as she didn’t want him in my life (for good reason, we’ll get to that in a second) but the judge worked something out that meant I had to go with him every other weekend (I don’t know the technical term for it. Some form of joint custody). My mom ended up re-marrying less than a year after she got divorced. I know that sounds fishy to some people but they’ve been married ever since and my step-dad is the one I actually call dad and have for a long time. He fought to stay in my life. What a good dad, right? Right… we’ll refer to him as SD from here on out. Sperm Donor. When I was seven years old I got my bag packed and ready on a Friday after school, wondering what we were going to do that weekend. I also remember being really anxious because the previous weekend he had me there’d been a lot of drama between me and his girlfriend at the time. We’ll call her M. Let me tell you about M. M was the type of lady to threaten me and lie about it when I told my mom what she said. M was the type of lady who would spank me (I don’t have an issue with disciplining your children but keep in mind this woman was NOT even married to my biological father) for getting out of bed too early in the morning and trying to wake them up because I was hungry. M was the type of woman to constantly berate and throw shade at my mother right in front of me. She absolutely hated my guts and the previous weekend accused me of being mean to her daughter which made SD mad at me and when he’d dropped me off he gave my mom a piece of his mind about my “behavior”. SD never showed up to come get me for the next visit. At 7 years old I was very upset and cried and cried. My mom kept trying to call him and he wasn’t answering the phone. She didn’t tell me at the time but I found out several years later that he did answer the phone once to tell my mom she could keep me before hanging up on her. I didn’t know it at the time but the previous weekend when all that arguing happened would be my last weekend with him. My little seven year old heart was crushed. I wrote letters that my mom dutifully mailed asking him to come get me for our weekends again. I missed my paternal grandparents who I only ever got to see on my weekends with him and I missed playing with M’s daughter and I just did not understand what was happening. My eighth birthday passed and he didn’t so much as call. Then one day my mom gets a phone call. The phone call that pertains to this question. See, part of the custody agreement was child support. Child support he paid my mom. Again, didn’t know it at the time because I was 8, but he had stopped paying his child support and when my mom called him out for it he went to Job and Family Services- or maybe he went to court, I’m not sure- demanding a DNA test because suddenly he didn’t think I was his child and wasn’t going to pay money for a kid he didn’t think was his. My mom explained it to me as best she could and tried to make me understand that I’d done nothing wrong, nobody was mad at me, it wasn’t my fault, he was doing this because he was mad at her. On a summer day, I went into that place and sat on my mom’s lap as a lady swabbed the inside of my cheek and took my picture. SD was in the room, too, but he wouldn’t even look at me. The results came back. I was his child. (Unfortunately). The results changed absolutely nothing. Sitting there in that room getting my cheek swabbed was the last time I saw him. That’s coming on a decade ago. He didn’t care whether or not I was his child. He was done with me. I tried writing more letters and they got sent back in the mail. He moved an hour and a half away and changed his phone number. When I was twelve years old, I found his address online and wrote him a letter. It didn’t get sent back but I also didn’t get a reply, so I sent another one a month or two later and the second one got sent back. He moved again to another city about two hours away. Two years ago I looked it up and found another address. Sent him a letter, it got sent back. Tried again, it got sent back. When I was 15 I took my step-dad’s last name. SD is really just a memory at this point, and as I’ve gotten older I find that those memories are not as fond as I once thought they were. I will never forget the day they took my DNA for the paternity test. I saw his car in the parking lot and my little heart nearly gave out I was so excited. I was sure as soon as I got in there he would tell me what had been going on and everything would go back to normal. I went in there and he would not even look at me. And I really don’t understand. I don’t understand why he fought to be in my life when I was 2 only to abandon me at 7. I found out from along the grape vine that he ended up marrying M and adopted her daughter. I don’t understand why he threw me out of his life and ran but then signed right on for another kid. Something else I don’t understand, looking at my baby picture, is the paternity test. Any half-blind human being can look at that baby picture and look at him and know I am his biological child. Just like he knew. I don’t know if he really just requested the DNA test because he was mad at my mom or not but it doesn’t matter to me. What he did hurt me in ways I don’t even know how to talk about and despite his absence, despite going on 10 years without any contact with him, I can’t stop thinking about the whole thing. In recent years, I have learned: My mother divorced him because of his infidelity. He cheated on her (most likely more than once)He was discharged from the Army because of a psych evaluation. I don’t know what was in the evaluation or what his issues were but I can take a few guesses.He was mean. Not mean to me necessarily, but mean to my mom and mean to other people. I don’t think he saw me as his daughter. I think he saw me as a possession. All these years later, I know I’m better off without him and yet I’m still constantly trying to put it together.

It's important to consider both the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions. Here are some points to consider: 1. Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their high volatility. While this volatility can present opportunities for significant gains, it also comes with the risk of substantial losses. If you're comfortable with and can withstand price fluctuations, you may consider investing in cryptocurrencies. 2. Potential Returns: The cryptocurrency market has experienced periods of substantial growth, and some investors have seen significant returns on their investments. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and it's essential to remember that the market can be unpredictable. 3. Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can be seen as a form of diversification in an investment portfolio. Adding cryptocurrencies to a well-diversified portfolio that includes traditional assets can potentially provide exposure to new investment opportunities. 4. Technological Innovation: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have the potential to disrupt various industries and enable new forms of decentralized applications. Some investors are attracted to the technological advancements and potential long-term value in this space. On the other hand, there are several risks to consider: 1. Market Volatility: The same volatility that can lead to potential gains can also result in significant losses. Cryptocurrency prices can be subject to dramatic swings, which can be challenging to predict or manage. 2. Regulatory and Legal Risks: The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations can impact the market and investor sentiment. It's important to stay informed about the legal and regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction. 3. Security Risks: Cryptocurrency investments come with security risks, such as the potential for hacks, scams, or loss of access to digital wallets. It's crucial to understand and implement best practices for securing your investments. 4. Lack of Regulation and Transparency: The cryptocurrency market is relatively unregulated compared to traditional financial markets. This lack of regulation can result in issues such as market manipulation, fraud, and limited transparency. It's important to conduct thorough research, educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider consulting with a financial advisor who specializes in cryptocurrencies to get personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

The reason? Short answer: The purported wave function collapse can be uncollapsed by measurement of another incompatible observable. The original collapse is now gone. Long answer: There are compatible and incompatible measurements represented by different observables. Compatibility means that different observables share the same type of purported collapse. When measurement of one type of compatible observable collapses the wave function, subsequent measurement of the second does not uncollapse it. Formally the commutator [A,B] = 0, meaning same eigenstates. Let's call these |A> and |B>, and the original state |S>. Incompatibility means observables share different types of collapse. That the collapse of one is not accompanied by the collapse of the other. So measurement of first observable collapses the wavefunction into an eigenstate of the first observable. But now a measurement of the 2nd observable collapses the wavefunction into an eigenstate of the 2nd observable. This is not the collapsed first observable eigenstate. In other words the initial collapse has been uncollapsed. Formally the commutator [A,B] is not equal to 0, meaning different eigenstates for A and B. Let's call these |A> and |B>, and the original state |S>. When |S> collapses to |A> on measuring A, a subsequent measurement of B puts it into |B>. This is not the same as |A>. If the A measurement is going to be carried out again, it will not behave as if the system was in the original collapsed state |A>."},{"prompt":"Do British people wholeheartedly agree with Suella Braverman when she said “Boris Johnson is one of the greatest prime ministers ever”?","completion":"It seems not.

It would seem to me that people like Stephen Hawking lost hope. I can only suspect that he did and I can’t help but to think that it is because “HE” was not able to figure the theory of everything out (now I can be wrong). In any case, the reason why I suspect that he gave up is because anyone that goes along with the multiverse theory, could only join into this ridiculous theory if they gave up. I agree with Viktor Toth on many aspects of his answer… But one thing that strikes me is he seems to think that the direct approach to solve gravity could be successful. It will not happen that way because as long as physicists use established math and known equations, they cannot find the underlying reason of how the experimentally determined parameters we take for granted in our equations came to exist. Those parameter are things like charge, distance, and what creates “straight” and a spatial dimension. I totally agree with Viktor that there is no reason to say that finding a theory of everything cannot be done since we do observe gravity and quantum phenomenon in the same universe. Viktor Toth is absolutely correct about the motivation for figuring out the theory of everything is not for the money… I developed Gordon’s Theory of Everything out of curiosity as to why the speed of light is the same in all reference frames.

While the 35 year old gurkha soldier was traveling in Maurya Express train from Ranchi to Gorakhpur, during midnight time in Chittaranjan jungles of West Bengal, around 30-40 armed robbers boarded the train and started looting the passengers. Later they started misbehaving with an 18 year old girl in front of her helpless parents, which is when Bishnu lost his cool. He took out his Khukuri (knife) and fought the group of robbers single handedly. He killed three of them in the fight and injured eight others. The remaining robbers got scared of Bishnu’s brave attack and fled the scene. The Indian army soldier explained about the incident saying: “They started snatching jewelry, cell phones, cash, laptops and other belongings from the passengers. They had carried out their robbery with swords, blades and pistols. The pistols may have been fake as they didn´t open fire. The girl cried for help, saying ´You are a soldier, please save a sister´. I prevented her from being raped, thinking of her as my own sister. Fighting the enemy in battle is my duty as a soldier; taking on the dacoits in the train was my duty as a human being.” During the fight, Bishnu had to suffer serious blade injury on his left hand, and the girl also had a small cut on her neck. However, the brave gurkha soldier managed to make good use of his Khukuri and save the chastity of a girl, along with hundreds of thousands in loot. Appreciating this brave act of Bishnu, his Gorkha Regiment gave him a cash reward of Rs. 50,000 and also terminated his voluntary retirement, so that he would get benefits of a customary promotion after receiving the medals of recognition. Bishnu Shrestha also received the Sena Medal for bravery from the Indian Army. Cheers to his brave and responsible act!"},{"prompt":"Circle B's radius is 1/3 the size of circle A's. Circle B travels around circle A one time. How many times does circle B spin around itself?","completion":"I only recently encountered this question, through a video posted online, which most people on here have probably already viewed. That video asserted that the answer was 4 revolutions. That is incorrect. I will attach two short papers explaining the phenomenon at issue: 1) the first addresses the smaller circle revolving around the outside of the larger circle; 2) the second addresses the smaller circle revolving around the inside of the larger circle. Since I am unable to attach Word documents, I have converted each paper to image files. The first paper consists of the first 3 pages; the second paper consists of the following 5 pages. The answer is that the smaller circle (Circle B here) will revolve (or, spin completely around its own axis of rotation) 3 times, NOT 4 times. Despite the fact that an “experiment” or “demonstration” appears to indicate that the smaller circle will complete 4 revolutions, that is an optical illusion. (Full explanation is provided in the first attached paper, the first 3 pages/images attached.) There are several points to consider: the smaller circle will complete a revolution once each point on its perimeter touches the surface along which it is travelinghowever, our visual perception of orientation depends on focusing on the center point of the smaller circle (or the writing on it, as it relates to the center of the circle)the center point of the smaller circle traces out a different circle, which we can call Circle C, which has a larger radius that is the sum of the radii of the other circles (R1+R2)focusing on the center point of Circle B as it travels along Circle C distorts our perception of when Circle B is “upright,” and thus when it has completed a revolution the most important point - the smaller circle’s axis of rotation is, itself, revolving as it travels along the larger circlesome people may say that the axis of rotation does not revolve - that only applies where the objects comprising the system are FIXED in relation to each other; in this scenario, they are NOT FIXED, which results in the axis of rotation revolvingin general, when a circle travels along a surface, its axis of rotation will revolve in harmony with the contours of the surface it is traversing the illusion of a 4th revolution results from the revolution of the smaller circle’s axis of rotation, which itself completes a single 360 degree revolution (that is the 4th revolution) But let’s also consider the correlate scenario, where the smaller circle makes a trip around the inside of the larger circle. A “demonstration” of that scenario would result in the conclusion that the smaller circle would complete merely 2 revolutions during that trip. Just as a matter of common sense, how is it possible that a circle with a circumference of 2pi can cover a distance of 6pi in just 2 revolutions? That would be one magic circle indeed! For that matter, how does it makes sense that it would require that circle 4 revolutions to travel around the outside perimeter, but only 2 revolutions to travel around the inside perimeter when the inner perimeter is exactly the same distance as the outer perimeter? In fact, applying the logic of the points identified above, we find that the smaller circle completes the same 3 revolutions when traversing the inner perimeter as it does when it traverses the outer perimeter. The only difference here is that the smaller circle’s axis of rotation is revolving in the opposite direction that the smaller circle itself is revolving when it traverses the inner perimeter. When it was traversing the outer perimeter, both the axis of rotation and the circle itself were revolving in the same direction. Thus, when traversing the inside, the revolution of the axis of rotation detracts one full revolution from the apparent number of revolutions that the smaller circle completes. (The second attached paper describes this scenario in further detail. That paper consists of pages/images 4–8 attached here.) Just a note: The video in which I saw this question presented had Circle A being the smaller circle, revolving around Circle B as the larger circle. Thus, in my papers, Circle A is the smaller circle that is moving around the larger circle.

This Could be a threat to many other companies like Amazon, Netflix, Fintech Startups (Phonepe, Paytm and GPay). Jio had spent 3 billion dollars to acquire dozens of Companies in last one year including Saavan, Haptik, Nowflots etc. Jio has more than 388 million users, which is highest among all Indian telecom companies. And Facebook was also desperate to make a big move in India but it had failed previously with Net neutrality. So by Investing in Jio, It could do what they wanted 3 years back. Jio has been working on a super app like WeChat and Indian apps like Paytm or Phonepe. Facebook sees plenty of opportunity with Jio. India is a large market for Facebook; more than 400 million people in the country use WhatsApp, its global messaging service, while more than 300 million people use the company’s core social network. WhatsApp has worked for years to build tools for small businesses and has dabbled in payment systems, while Facebook has also invested in creating digital storefronts for entrepreneurs to sell goods and services online. By bringing together JioMart, Jio’s small-business initiative, with WhatsApp, they can enable people to connect with businesses, shop and ultimately purchase products in a seamless mobile experience. More recently, Facebook has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over WhatsApp. The government has demanded that WhatsApp change its encryption to trace messages back to their source, which WhatsApp has refused to do. At the same time, regulators have repeatedly delayed WhatsApp’s request to offer a payments service to its Indian users. Ambani has also been the most powerful corporate voice urging regulators to take an India first approach that favours companies like Facebook and Amazon. But this partnership can bring life to Whatsapp pay in India. If it is true then Jio will enter in E-commerce and Media Industry using Jiomart and Jio Tv enabled by Whatsapp Pay. Which is the biggest threat to Amazon, they will become head to head competitors Because of Prime Videos and Amazon E-commerce. Jio has ambitions to take on Amazon in e-commerce, run data centres, provide fibre internet to homes and businesses and set up new services like telehealth and distance learning.

Take your cat to your veterinarian. Travel, especially air travel, can be difficult for cats. You want to ensure your cat is healthy enough for the flight. Your veterinarian will examine her and make sure she is up to date on all of her vaccinations. If your cat has an illness, ask your veterinarian how it can be managed or treated (if possible) prior to your flight. Your veterinarian may need to complete a health certificate for your cat, certifying she is healthy enough for travel and has all of the required vaccinations. The health certificate requirements may vary according to your destination, so confirm these requirements with the airline before your appointment. There are time restrictions on health certificate completion. Airlines typically require health certificates to be completed within 10 days of a flight, but confirm your airline's specific time restriction. Ask your veterinarian to microchip your cat for easy identification. If your cat is already microchipped, consider asking your veterinarian to scan the microchip to make sure it can be read. If your cat is on medication, ask your veterinarian about how you can continue to medicate your cat on your day of travel. 2. Purchase an airline-approved carrier. If you have not traveled by plane with your cat before, you may need to purchase an airline-approved pet carrier. Call your airline or search the airline’s website for pet carrier requirements for cabin and cargo travel. Generally, a ‘cabin’ cat carrier should be made of a durable fabric (e.g., nylon), be well ventilated, and have a zippered top and side door. Your airline may also require the carrier to have a soft removable bottom pad. A good cargo carrier should be made of sturdy and durable plastic and have a secure door latch. Make sure the carrier is large enough for your cat to move around and be comfortable in. 3. Encourage your cat to spend time in her carrier. Your cat will need at least one month to get ready for air travel. During this time, invite your cat to spend more time in his/her carrier. Make it look inviting by putting some of her creature comforts inside of it, such as comfortable bedding and favorite toys. Leave the carrier open at all times in a location where your cat frequents, such as her bed or a scratching post. This lets your cat explore her carrier at her leisure and without fear of you closing the door when she steps inside of it. Consider spraying cat pheromones inside the carrier so it smells familiar to her. Feed her in the carrier so she can have a positive association with it. Practice closing the door when she is inside of it (after you've given her time to explore it). Start by closing the door for a few seconds, then opening it and immediately giving her a treat. Slowly increase the amount of you leave the door closed before opening it and giving her a treat. 4. Take your cat on car rides. When your cat is comfortable with her carrier, place her inside of it and take her on car rides. Start with short car rides — just around the block and back. As she gets more comfortable with car travel, take her on longer rides. Secure the carrier in the car with a seatbelt. Take your cat to a desirable location, such as back home — not the veterinarian’s office. Give her a treat at the end of the car ride if she behaves well (no scratching or incessant crying). Staying still in the carrier while the car is moving may be a bit bewildering to your cat at first, but she will get used to it over time. Try to start the car rides at least a few weeks before your flight. 5. Acclimate your cat to loud noises. Not only is the plane noisy, but the airport can be noisy too. When your cat is comfortable with car rides, take her to the airport and sit outside with her in the carrier. The loud noise and commotion may be terrifying for your cat at first, so it will probably take a few trips to the airport before your cat becomes used to the loud noises. You could also take her inside the airport, near the flight check-in area. Give your cat some treats to reward her for good behavior. Allow a few weeks for your cat to get accustomed to airport noises. 6. your cat’s nails. Trim If your cat’s nails are long, she could use them to scratch up the interior of her carrier during the flight. If she has to travel in the cargo area, she could get her nails stuck in the carrier’s bars, which could lead to injury. If you are not comfortable trimming your cat’s nails, have your veterinarian do so. A cat’s nails should be trimmed once every 10 days to 2 weeks, so time the nail trimming so her nails do not become long again before the trip. If you will be away from home for a long time, bring some nail clippers with you. Part 2 of 3:Making Other Travel Preparations1. Book your flight. Airlines are often limited with how many pets can travel in the plane’s cabin. For this reason, you should book your flight well in advance (1 month or more) to increase the chances of your cat staying with you in the cabin. When you call to book your flight, ask if the airline allows pets on the plane, and if your cat can travel in the cabin. Because of your cat’s small size, it is preferable for her to travel in the cabin rather than the cargo hold. Expect to pay an extra fee for your cat, which may be up to 100. Be aware that, if your cat can travel with you in the cabin, her carrier will count as one of your allotted carry-ons. When you book your flight, make sure to get a locator number for your cat that is associated with your seat number. Try to book a direct, nonstop flight. Also, avoid booking a flight for the middle of the day in the summer. 2. Check your cat’s ID collar. Your cat’s ID collar should have several tags: one with your contact information (name, address, cell phone number), and one tag each for rabies vaccination status and your cat’s license. Remove any collar accessories, such as small trinkets or charms, that could get easily snagged on a part of her carrier. Make sure her collar is appropriate for travel before your flight. 3. Make labels for your cat’s carrier. This is particularly important if your cat will be traveling in the cargo hold, but would also be a good idea for cabin travel. The label should contain your own contact information, as well as contact information at your end destination. For example, if you will be staying at a hotel, write down the hotel’s name, address, and phone number on the label. Place a label on the inside and outside of the carrier, in case the outside label comes off during the course of travel. In addition, if your cat will be traveling in the cargo hold, make a few large ‘Live Animal’ labels and place them on the outside of her carrier. Make the labels at least a few days before your trip so you will not have to rush to do it on the day of travel. 4. Prepare bags of dry food for your cat. Cats should travel on an empty stomach to prevent vomiting or elimination accidents in the carrier during the flight. However, if your flight gets delayed for several hours or more, it would be a good idea to give your cat a few nibbles of food to keep her from getting too hungry. If your cat is in the cargo hold for a long flight, attach a bag of food to the carrier with feeding instructions. Part 3 of 3:Preparing Your Cat on the Day of Air Travel1. Keep your normal routine. As much as possible, keep a calm and normal routine on the travel day. Cats do not always respond well to change, so a sudden change in routine could increase your cat’s anxiety and stress levels and may cause her to act out (e.g., eliminate outside of her litter box). Keep calm in your preparations and try to maintain her normal feeding schedule so she uses her litterbox as she usually would. Once you put her in her carrier, she will not be able to eliminate again until after you arrive at your destination. Keeping things calm and normal will help her empty her bladder and bowels before you place her in the carrier. 2. Feed your cat 4 to 6 hours before your flight. Maintaining a normal feeding schedule may be tricky if your flight is less than 4 to 6 hours before her regular mealtime. During your month of preparation, consider gradually adjusting her mealtime so it will coincide with the 4- to 6-hour window of time before your flight. Alternatively, you could try to find a flight that time that would fall within 4 to 6 hours of her regular mealtime. Once you have fed her before the flight, do not feed her again until after you arrive at your destination. You or the flight staff may have to feed her, though, if you have an international flight or a flight with multiple stops. Your cat can have water up to 1 hour before the flight. 3. Give your cat her medications. If your cat is currently on medications, schedule their administration according to your travel schedule. Do give your cat a tranquilizer before your flight, unless advised by your vet. Tranquilizers can affect your cat’s ability to regulate her body temperature, which can have serious consequences if she is traveling in the cargo hold. If giving tranquilizers, test the medication on your cat at least a couple of days before. This will allow you to calculate the ideal dose and avoid overdosing or underdosing the cat on the travel day. In addition, the tranquilizer test dose will wear off before travel day. 4. Secure your cat in its carrier. Before you leave the house, make sure your cat is securely within the carrier. An airport can be a frightening place for cats, and you do not want to give her any opportunity to bolt out of her carrier. To make the carrier more comfortable for her, make it smell familiar (e.g., cat pheromones, her bedding, clothing with your scent on it). If you must take her out of its carrier at airport security, keep a very firm hold on it. Ask the airport security staff if you can go through an alternative screening where your cat can stay in the carrier. 5. Keep your cat calm. Whether your cat will be traveling with you in the cabin or in the cargo hold, practice some verbal and nonverbal communication to keep it calm before the flight. For example, look at her in her carrier and blink slowly until she blinks back—this is a positive form of communication for cats. In addition, you can talk to her reassuringly before and during the flight."},{"prompt":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","completion":"It’s to do with their sociology and hunting characteristics. Felines usually hunt alone, stalking their prey. For this they need to be massively powerful to bring down usually much bigger prey than themselves. This means they need a large skeletal frame and muscle mass and explosive energy to bring down an animal fast. They go for the jugular and end it within seconds. They are like the muscle-bound 100m Olympic sprinters. Canines usually hunt in packs. They do not require the same level of size or muscle mass, which is a huge liability and requires an incredible amount of food to sustain.

If we all put down our defensive stance for a moment and just discuss “gun regulations” I believe we will find ourselves on the same channel. Putting aside a minority of extreme no comprimise opponents you might be surprised that most of us DO feel the need for reasonable firmarms regulation. What gets our defenses up is that so many seem to want gun confiscation, not just gun regulation. I’m convinced most of us would like to see illegally obtained firearms out of the hands of the actual bad actors committing crimes including murder. Our justice system seems to be geared in the hoodlums favor constantly setting them free immediately and in many cases with no bail. Yet we seem to find the law abiding armed citizen to be the cause and root of all firearms evil. Speaking for myself only, I firmly believe gun regulations are necessary and serve a good purpose. Many things I do or have done in life required a license or permit that was intended to show my ability to competently and safely perform the task at hand and a firearm is no different. But seeking totalitarian revocation of owning a firearm is not how to go at it. I live in California where firearm regulations are very strick and even though I have no problem with most of them it seems crime is still high and actually rising. As a society we direct our firearms regulations more strickly to the legal owners instead of the criminals. Even as a US Marine Veteran of 8 years with fairly good rifle and handgun training here is what I needed to do to buy a handgun in California. a) Showed my California Real ID along with supporting proof of residency. b) Took a 30 question FSC (Firearm Safety Certificate) written test. c) Paid 25 after passing FSC to obtain a DOJ Safety Certificate good for 5 years. d) Paid 7 fee for DROS1 Turner Outdoorsman Dealer Handling Fee. e) Paid 5 fee for DROS EQ fee California Dept. of Justice (DOJ) f) Paid 1 fee for DROS1 California DOJ Safety Fee. g) Paid 31.19 fee For DROS DOJ DES fee California h) 10 day waiting period started after completing a-g above. i) Returned after 10 days to take possession of handgun. J) Completed final paperwork and gave my thumb print. k) Performed a safety check with staff to prove I could operate the new firearm. l) Paid off balance owed and departed the place of business. j) We also get charged a 1 DOJ fee every time we want to buy a box of ammunition. I have recently applied (Aug 2022) for a CCW permit via the San Diego County Sheriff. My interview date for determination is June 5, 2023 so that is 10 months waiting just to get the interview. My fees just for the determination process: Application fee20, Live Scan fee93, Final fee80, TOTAL193. If I get approved I then have to take a full 8 hour CCW course which includes classroom and live fire training at a range and that cost 200. When approved my permit is only valid for 2 years. Can we agree that the law abiding citizen is put through some serious regulatory process just to legally own a firearm? So why not make it hard on criminals who REFUSE to play by the rules? Do the crime and expect to do the time and pay retribution to those violated! As a legal gun owner with absolutely no criminal record I have no problem with reasonable firearms regulations. But that does not mean total confiscation which appears to be the goal of so many anti-gun advocates. I feel most firearm owners are up for discussion about gun regulations. But those opposing firearms who can’t tell the difference between a fully automatic M16 and a Ruger mini 14 ranch rifle need to be willing to listen and educate themselves just as well."},{"prompt":"What is the tweet of day 18 of July 2021?","completion":"A pornographic video was circulated on WhatsApp by a group run by some Muslim youths in Farukkabad in UP.

Rotary engines fixed the crankshaft to the airframe and the engine cylinder spun. The they decided this has too many disadvantages, so the engine was fixed and the crank spun. It makes for a somewhat compact engine in a linear sense but produces much more drag than an inline engine. Radials are generally a bit heavier than inline liquid cooled engines and produce less HP per CU in (KW/L). Liquid cooling means you can also use higher boost pressures with a supercharger without detonation. One advantage of radials is if you wanted more power you just add a row of cylinders. This culminated in the R-3350 [LINKED_TEXT: Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone - Wikipedia1937 18-cylinder radial piston engine family by Wright The Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone is an American twin-row, supercharged , air-cooled, radial aircraft engine with 18 cylinders displacing nearly 3,350 cubic inches (54.9 L). Power ranged from 2,200 to over 3,700 hp (1,640 to 2,760 kW), depending on the model. Developed before World War II , the R-3350's design required a long time to mature before finally being used to power the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . After the war, the engine had matured sufficiently to become a major civilian airliner design, notably in its turbo-compound forms, and was used in the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners into the 1950s. The engine is commonly used on Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat Unlimited Class Racers at the Reno Air Races . Its main rival was the 4,360 in 3 (71.4 L), 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , first run some seven years after the Duplex-Cyclone's beginnings. Design and development [ edit ] In 1927, Wright Aeronautical introduced its famous \\"Cyclone\\" engine, which powered a number of designs in the 1930s. After merging with Curtiss to become Curtiss-Wright in 1929, an effort was started to redesign the engine to the 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) class. The new Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 first ran successfully in 1935, and became one of the most-used aircraft engines in the 1930s and WWII, powering all frontline examples (the -C through -G models) of the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber aircraft serving in the war, each powerplant assisted by a General Electric -designed turbocharger for maximum power output at high altitudes. By 1931 Pratt & Whitney had started a development of their equally famous single-row, Wasp nine-cylinder design into a larger and much more powerful fourteen-cylinder, twin-row design — the R-1830 Twin Wasp — of a nearly identical 30-liter displacement figure, that would easily compete with this larger, single-row Cyclone. In 1935 Wright followed P&W's lead, and developed much larger engines based on the mechanics of the Cyclone. The result was two designs with a somewhat shorter stroke, a 14-cylinder design of almost 43 liters displacement that would evolve into the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone , and a much larger 18-cylinder design that became the R-3350. A larger twin-row 22-cylinder version, the Wright R-4090 Cyclone 22 , was experimented with as a competitor to the 71.5 liter-displacement four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , but was not produced. With Pratt & Whitney starting development of their own 46 liter-displacement 18-cylinder, twin-row high-output radial as the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp in 1937, Wright's first R-3350 prototype engines — itself having a nearly 55 liter displacement figure — were initially run in May of the same year. Continued development was slow, both due to the complex nature of the engine, as well as the R-2600 receiving considerably more attention. The R-3350 did not fly until 19https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone]and 4360 engines [LINKED_TEXT: Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia R-28 piston aircraft engine family The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II . First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family , and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology. The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets , but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56 ). Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone , first run some seven years earlier (May 1937). Design and development [ edit ] The R-4360 was a 28- cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \\"corncob\\" nickname. [1] A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds. The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri . [2] The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required. [ citation needed ] Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest. Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy. [3] Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era. Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW). Engines weighed 3,482–3,870 lb (1,579–1,755 kg), giving a power-to-weight ratio of 1.11 hp/lb (1.82 kW/kg). Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built. A derivative engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E , was essentially the R-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major]producing over 3000 hp. The disadvantage is more moving parts means far less reliability and LOTS of maintenance per flying hour. As soon as turboprops came along radials were largely doomed because turboprops produce much more HP per lb (are lighter and more powerful) and orders of magnitude more reliable."},{"prompt":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","completion":"Quora is a CCP operation"},{"prompt":"Can we defeat Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle by having one person measure the particle's position, while another one measures its momentum, but the two people don't talk to each other, but give their results to a third party?","completion":"When we talk about “observers,” think about the test doing the measuring rather than the human looking at the testing instrument. How do you measure something? You measure something by getting another thing to interact with it. You observe a potted plant by seeing photons bounce off of it, for example. If there are no photons bouncing off it, the room is dark and you can’t see the plant. The potted plant is large. The photons are small. So the light doesn’t seem to interfere with the position or speed of the potted plant. That’s the situation we’re used to when we think about “observing” things. But that situation doesn’t really give us an intuitive grasp of trying to measure a single tiny particle/wave with another single other particle/wave. That’s more like trying to find a potted plant in the dark by throwing other potted plants at it. With subatomic particles, the things we’re using to observe are a bit more on-scale with what’s being observed. And this is where things start to get weird, because of wave-particle duality. So lets turn out the lights and go to a pool table. You want to figure out the location of a pool ball somewhere on the table (which is actually both a wave and a particle, because that’s how things are at this level.) And you can only do this by throwing other wave/particle pool balls. So now things are getting a bit more tricky, because every time you ‘look’ at your target, you disturb it. Interacting with a particle to ‘see’ it inherently changes the setup you’re looking at! But things are even worse than that, because of the ‘wave’ aspect of the balls we’re using. Everything we throw is both kindof a wave and kindof a particle to some extent. So lets say we use a photon to bounce off a pool ball. It’s a really low energy photon, so it won’t disturb the ball too much. Low energy means that it has a large wavelength, so it’s like throwing a huge circular pillow with almost no weight. You don’t disturb your target much, but it’s hard to figure out where your target is by throwing these huge, fluffy, light weight pillows. Okay, so lets use a wave with more energy now. The wavelength is smaller. It’s like a bullet. Tiny. Accurate. But it disturbs the heck out of the system we’re observing. You shoot our target pool ball with your bullet and the ball goes ricocheting off to who-knows-where. The more accurate we get (small particle), the more we disturb the system we’re trying to observe in unpredictable ways. Edit: And this doesn’t even begin to get into the difficulties illuminated by the double-slit experiment, where subatomic particles exist as a sort of probability cloud until they’re observed as particles."},{"prompt":"What are some of the best actual images of real atoms and molecules?","completion":"Here are some pictures of atoms I took yes it is possible to photograph.

I slowed, but he just drove away. What just happened?","completion":"He was telling you to slow down. Simple as that and it worked. Some people think that the police are always out to get them. This illustrates the point that we are human too. He might have been at end of shift or like most of us just wanted you to comply with the posted speed. Now for another story. In 2016 I ( with the permission of my wife of course) purchased a brand spanking new Mustang. I drove it all over town showing it off to friends. Now a lot of my friends were local police officers. They all knew that I was a retired officer. They all started to make bets on how fast it would really go. I asked them where they were going with this. The Chief said he had an idea. Now you must know that this is a very small town ( population of about 1,600 ). And there is absolutely no traffic after 9pm. So now Chief Jones says to meet him on the old highway at midnight. I'm starting to feel like a teenager again. Now I arrived at the location and the Chief says try her out sarge, (my nick name ). I told him that he was crazy, I wasn't going to take off down the road before I drove the road looking for debris in the road. He told me that they already did and that the road was clear. He said that for me to go as fast as I wanted. He said he had an officer at the city limits to make sure that there was no conflict with the county guys. So I tromped on it and burned rubber for about 20 ft. I actually got up to 160 mph with plenty of pedal left. I drove back to the officers and told them what my top speed was. The Chief said he already knew what the top speed was as they had just received their new radar guns the day before and thought that this was the perfect way to test them. So they got to test the radar and I had a blast. We went back to the station and had coffee and donuts, and all was good in the world. I didn't even charge them for being their unwitting guinea pig."},{"prompt":"Without appealing to emotion or using ad hominem attacks, how can I convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing?","completion":"You can start by educating your self in the propensity of governments everywhere and in all times. The people who make up the government always begin to see themselves as the ultimate source of all wisdom and power. They always rationalize how if the little people were just a little smarter and would do the right things all problems would disappear. If the problems don’t go away it is not because the idea was flawed, it must be because the little people are sabotaging it. A law to force compliance will do the trick. That’s why free enterprise is so important to freedom. Bill Hewelett was too stupid to know the tuning mechanism could not be shrunk small enough to make a car radio. The physics of the day just would not allow it. So he just went ahead and did it. So cars in the 50s had radios. Henry Ford found a way to reorganize vehicle manufacture so the vehicle moved down a line of people who only knew how to complete one small portion of the assembly, but they got very good at that one thing. The assembly line was borne and the little guy got his car. Edsele thought they had a better idea, they were wrong and they went out of business. IBM thought they had computers locked up, but they forgot to tell Bill Gates and Microsoft levered into PCs from any manufacturer and in time IBM sold their hardware line to Lenovo. Steve Jobs locked the personal computer down tight. Only he could manufacture it or license software to run on. His hardware is good enough and he turned the iPod into the iPhone and the iPad. The open source PC sells many times the machine count as the PC. Open source Android is cheaper and very good but the single source Apple iPhone and iPad make it easier to design applications and attachments. So the two lines continue to compete with different philosophies. However, they must rely on persuasion of free people. Back to governments. They do not have freely win the support of the masses. They rely on compulsion. Mao had it right when he declared government power grows out the barrel of a gun. The U.S. government just ordered truckers, who work in solitary situations, to lose their jobs because they do not want to be vaccinated. That same government is allowing 10,000 unscreened illegal alien disease vectors into the country everyday and going beyond that to transport them all over the country. They are catching and releasing violent criminals over and over until a particular criminal kills someone the government thinks is important. Cab drivers and convenience store clerks don’t count. The violent crime rates are rising out of control. The criminals are already banned from having a gun, but they are cut loose within 24 hrs to buy another one stolen by a burglar who has been caught 11 times in two weeks. Then the government says guns are the problem. They have enough laws already on the books. If a person commits a violent crime keep them locked up. They won’t commit any more crimes while they are in jail. If a person is arrested while on pretrial release no sane judge would release them again. Canada just locked up the financial accounts of unvaccinated truckers who were nonviolently saying things Trudeau did not like. On top of that Parliament just required a “journalist to be licensed and if the licensing board does not like a person’s opinions that person can not get a license. There is no notice and no appeal. Buy the way, what about the docs who think anyone who wants to use a firearm is ip so facto insane. In one sentence the anti-gunners say rely on the police to protect you from the violent criminals they just released on society. In the next sentence the antis demand the police be abolished. Now explain how we should trust irrational tyrannical governments like that."},{"prompt":"ve you ever been judged for your appearance?","completion":"I don’t very often, but one time my friend recommended me for a job.

They don’t have a any customers, you can’t just walk in and buy something. An employee let him know that I was there and I walked into the room. He looked up at me briefly but was much more interested in whatever was on his computer. I stood there for a full minute before I just decided to say hi and say my name. He still didn’t say anything, or look up from his computer. He finally stood up and shook my hand and said he wasn’t interested. I asked him if the position had already been filled. He said that it hadn’t, but that if I wanted the job, I shouldn’t have worn shorts. I told him that the only way he’s going to have an editor come in with pants on, it would only be because that’s what he found most comfortable. This is not the position in which you should expect any kind of formal dress. My best work has been done in my underwear, and it was all more interesting, better paying work than he could possibly hope to offer me.

I told him he wouldn’t be in business another year, just based on what I had seen after 10 minutes of being shown around the place. 9 months later, he folded. He stayed open as long as he possibly could, hoping things would get better, so according to my friend, he lost everything in the business.

Here are a few tips to get you started: Firstly, you need to understand your audience. Who are they? What kind of content do they like? What do they share? Once you have a clear understanding of your target audience, it becomes easier to create content that resonates with them. You can use tools like Google Analytics or Facebook Insights to gather insights about your audience. Secondly, keep an eye on industry trends and news. Stay updated with what's happening in your industry and create content around it. This will not only keep your content relevant but also help establish your brand as a thought leader. Thirdly, repurpose your existing content. If you have a blog post or a podcast episode that performed well, turn it into a social media post. You can also create infographics, videos, or memes based on your existing content. This way, you can keep your social media profiles active without creating new content from scratch. Lastly, don't forget to engage with your audience. Social media is all about building relationships. Respond to comments, ask questions, and encourage your followers to share their thoughts. This will not only increase engagement but also give you ideas for future content. I hope these tips help you generate content for social media. Remember, consistency is key. Create a content calendar, plan your posts in advance, and track your performance.

The Nazis blitzkrieged their way into France and took it in 46 days. This was the plan formalized by the German generals. There were many divisions involved in this operation, which was nicknamed Case Yellow/Fall Gelb. Credits for this plan goes to Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian. They meticulously planned out this attack and executed it so perfectly that France was utterly crushed and its army forced to retreat to Dunkirk. This attack was similar to the von Schlieffen plan set in WW1, but with a more vicious streak. The summary was that the German panzer and armoured divisions were to sweep through the countries while pinpointing the locations of the most concentrated pockets of enemy forces, but the armoured divisions did not engage. Rather, the Luftwaffe helped gun most of the enemy divisions down but of course there were still survivors. So, the Wehrmacht foot soldiers were to march behind the violent blitzkrieg action carried out by the Panzers and the Luftwaffe and to wipe out any stragglers and to secure victory within the enemy cities while the enemy was still trying to find out what happened. The only flaw in the plan was Dunkirk, when Hitler ordered the German forces to stop short of the ports near the English Channel, where the remaining French forces were situated, helplessly waiting for the British to arrive. The Luftwaffe was to finish off the enemy forces, but that obviously failed. It was Goring’s suggestion that it was the Luftwaffe, not the Wehrmacht that would finish the French forces. General Heinz Guderian later noted: ‘What the future of the war would have been like if we had succeeded in taking the British Expeditionary Force prisoners at Dunkirk is now impossible to guess.’"},{"prompt":"w do I clean up Gmail quickly?","completion":"Go To your Gmail Account and Sign In.

He is the poet not only of The White Man’s Burden, which is undeniably both imperialist and racist, but of Gunga Din: “Though I’ve belted you and flayed you By the living Gawd that made you You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din!” So not altogether bereft of self-awareness, or indeed awareness of the cruelties of the Empire.

The human mind has a difficult time in fathoming just how big infinity is. That sometimes makes it difficult to properly analyze a problem or discuss ideas related to infinite nature. The logic goes like this: Suppose you have 10 boxes numbered 1 thru 10 lined up. In the next row, you line them up with the #1 moved to the end so the sequence is 2,3,4...9,10,1. In the next row you move the #2 to the end. You keep repeating this until you have created every single permutation of the arrangement of these 10 boxes. Can you guess how many rows of boxes that will be? Every permutation will take 3,628,800 rows. Let’s call this number “K”. If I put out a billion more rows of 10 boxes each, they would all be in one of the “K” arrangements of the boxes. Even if I put out a trillion rows of boxes, all the possible arrangements of the boxes will still be the same finite number “K”. Once we have reached all the possible arrangements of those 10 boxes, any others we add will only be a duplicate of one of the arrangements that is already there. Now imagine that instead of boxes in a row, you are rearranging the atoms that make up matter. For instance, the matter that makes up a star or a planet. All of the possible arrangements of all of the atoms of that planet or sun would be an extremely large number - so big that we probably could not calculate it BUT using logic, we can prove that it is a finite number because the total number of possible arrangement of the boxes is finite - meaning that it is less than infinity. Just within the observable universe - which we estimate to be about 93 billion light years across - there are between 10^78 atoms (that is 10 raised to the 78th power or 10x10x10x10. . . . .78 times) - It might be as large as 10^83.. That's between ten quadrillion vigintillion and one-hundred thousand quadrillion vigintillion atoms. . . . that is a big number however, it IS a finite number. Now imagine that we calculate every possible arrangement of every atom in the universe. Note that the number of atoms in the universe will be infinite in an infinite universe BUT, like those boxes, the possible arrangements of those atoms is finite. Granted, it will be a very very big number but as with those boxes, there are just so many different ways that they can be arranged. The distinction that we are talking about is a finite number of arrangements of those atoms and NOT the number of atoms, is important. Note that we are dealing with very very large numbers here. These are numbers in which the exponent of 10 will easily exceed a billion digits long. Even our fastest computers would not count this high a number. This is well beyond the ability for humans to calculate and we can only deal in numbers on this scale with logic and in the abstract but we can say with certainty which of these numbers are and are not infinite. That means that if you go far enough into the infinite universe, you will have exhausted all of the possible arrangements that atoms can be put together but because space is infinite, the things that those atoms were arranged to be will start repeating themselves. That means that if you go far enough into an infinite universe, you'll find another Earth that looks exactly like this one. But now comes the part that is hard to grasp. Infinity is so much larger than it will take to find that first duplicate Earth, that if you keep going, you will find another one and another one, on and on forever. There will be an infinite number of Earths that have every possible arrangement of atoms. One of those Earths will contain you but of the opposite sex, and skin color and hair color - every possible variation of you is out there somewhere. You can't say that it will stop somewhere or that it can't happen because then it wouldn't be an infinite universe. It doesn't matter if there is an infinite number of atoms - like those 10 boxes, there is not an infinite number of arrangement of those atoms. There's two things wrong with this. The first is that it assumes that the universe is infinite but that it maintains the same laws of physics, math and chemistry that exist on Earth. We do not know that either of those are true. We think that is true but we don’t know for sure. The second is that there is absolutely no possible way that we can test or confirm this by anything other than imagination and speculation..and that means it is NOT science. We might call it philosophy or a belief. We might have faith that it is true because it is logical but we cannot call it science. There is also a logical “proof” that the universe is, indeed, infinite.

For instance, they put themselves in certain locations to increase orders & to test other zones for activity, while saving gas.","completion":"It’s not ethical because DoorDash typically increases pay after each declined order which means you’re declining the delivery for artificial purposes; meaning you’re not at the location to the restaurant that DoorDash is basing your pay on. You’re also imposing on a local legitimate person for scheduled hours which does have intention to completing deliveries and not decline everything just to see how busy it is. There’s no section about “GPS” in their Terms of Service, nor the Independent Contractor Agreement for the United States. What I found was [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #mtrLp] CONTRACTOR understands (i) he/she is free to select those times he/she wishes to be available on the platform to receive delivery opportunities; (ii) he/she is free to accept or reject the opportunities transmitted through the DOORDASH platform by consumers, and can make such decisions to maximize his/her opportunity to profit; and (iii) he/she has the sole right to control the manner in which deliveries are performed and the means by which those deliveries are completed.It’d be great to persuade the app developers to progress features which would make everyone more productive with more detailed order history and activity. There’s nothing efficient about the app sending you a pickup order 20 minutes away because it thinks you’re the closest driver when really you’re missing out on the order right next to you. It would be an update for delivery apps to provide a way which enables drivers to inform the algorithm that they will be traveling a particular direction and arrive in 20 minutes. It is already capable of knowing that that’s how far you are from that location. While convenient for you, it isn’t for the nearest driver that’s already there. Additionally, if the order could be prepared and ready in 10 minutes and not the 20 minutes for a driver that’s spoofing their location to think they’re the best driver for the job then there is an unnecessary wait. If food preparation times were exact and taken into account for traveling that’s already happening it could be efficient. Instead of a driver in the parking lot waiting 30 minutes for a large order it would be someone traveling to that location anyway and arrive just in time. In my experience these pickup times are not exact. Food can be ready much before or even immediately available following a ping.

One such industry that has embraced mobile apps is the online bookstore industry. With the rise of eBooks and e-readers, online bookstores have become popular, and many bookstores have shifted their focus from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online platforms. In this article, we will discuss how much it costs to develop an online bookstore mobile app. Read also: [LINKED_TEXT: Best Mobile app development companies in Bangalore] [URL: https://www.brillmindz.com/mobile-app-development-companies-in-india/] Understanding the Online Bookstore Mobile App An online bookstore mobile app is an application that allows users to purchase and read books on their mobile devices. The app provides a platform for bookstores to showcase their products, and users can browse through the store, search for books, and make purchases. Additionally, the app may include features such as book recommendations, reviews, and social sharing. App Development Platform The choice of platform for developing the mobile app will significantly affect the development cost. The two primary platforms for mobile app development are iOS and Android. The app's design is a critical factor in determining the development cost. A well-designed app with an intuitive user interface and appealing graphics will cost more than a simple app with basic features. App Features The features included in the app will also affect the cost of development. An app with advanced features such as book recommendations, social sharing, and personalized reading suggestions will cost more to develop than an app with basic features. The app may need to integrate with other systems such as payment gateways, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and shipping providers. The cost of integrating these systems will add to the development cost. Development Team The size and expertise of the development team will also affect the cost of development. Hiring a team of experienced developers will cost more than hiring a team with less experience. Based on the above factors, the cost of developing an online bookstore mobile app can range from 10,000 to 250,000 or more. The cost will depend on the complexity of the app, the features included, the app design, the app development platform, and the development team's size and expertise. Developing an app for a single platform, either iOS or Android, can cost between 10,000 to 50,000. Developing an app for both platforms can cost between 50,000 to 100,000 or more.The app's design can cost between 5,000 to 50,000 depending on the complexity and quality of the design. The cost of app features can vary depending on the complexity of the feature. Basic features such as a book catalog and shopping cart can cost between 10,000 to 20,000. Advanced features such as personalized recommendations and social sharing can cost between 50,000 to 100,000 or more.

This is changing a little bit due to operas being telecast more than they have been in the past, but overall, casting tends to be mostly color blind (unless the role specifically calls for a particular racial makeup, like the roles in Otello-but that isn't very common)and not as particular regarding the age of the singer.Opera singers are trained to make a particular type of sound/tone when singing-they don't utilize other sounds when singing. Purity of tone in the entire vocal range is paramount in opera.Acting isn't really as important as the singing-the emphasis in opera performance is on the ability to execute the difficult music well. If you are an amazing singer, but are a weak actor, that is forgiven more than the other way around.Most of, if not all of the opera is sung, not spoken. The closest opera comes to dialogue would be what is called the recitatitve-a portion of the aria that is sung like speech. It is not exactly spoken, but the rhythm and speed the recitative is performed at has the feel of speech. It takes time to get the hang of it, especially if you don't speak the language the opera is written in.Required vocal ranges for opera are much more extensive-a vocalist has to have at least two octaves of performance quality notes in order to sing the rep. Squeaking out a high C is not an option, the quality of the tone at the bottom and the top of the singer's range MUST be consistent.Opera performances are typically not miked-the singers are expected to be able to project over an orchestra without any amplification. With musicals: Singers only have to worry about one language for the most part: English.Casting is heavily dependent on the actor's look-the actor must look the role first and foremost. Whether they are the best singer for the role is a secondary consideration. This is changing somewhat with the move by directors and casting people to consider diversity in casting to give minority performers more options for performing, but it will be a long time if ever, before audiences see a black Maria for Sound of Music, or a white Bess for Porgy and Bess.Acting is more important than the singing.Singers can, and do, sing in various styles-they can sing like an opera singer (called legit singing) or they can be expected to belt (think Ethel Merman), or simply chat their way through a song without really singing it.Spoken dialogue is part of a musical-not all of the musical is usually sung.The music does not require as much of the singer technique wise, nor does it require the extended range that opera does.Musical theater singers are typically miked when they sing."},{"prompt":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","completion":"i don’t know"},{"prompt":"What is the most foul smelling thing you found when cleaning out a room or closet in your house or garage?","completion":"10 pound bag of rotten potatoes."},{"prompt":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","completion":"hotflirty.comRad One day the younger twin, Akuma, found her soul mate; so the two decided to seal their love in marriage, and they made all the necessary arrangements for the great day.

Lord Vishnu sensed the same and decided to humble Sudarshan Chakra. Sudarshan Chakra wanted to prove that even Lord Vishnu was incomplete without him. Lord Vishnu then offered Sudarshan Chakra to be born on the Bhulok with his full potency. Sudarshan chakra did not want to let this oppurtunity go and so agreed to this offer. He was born as the thousand armed King Kartavirya Arjuna in the Haihayas clan. He grew upto be a great devotee of Lord Dattatreya. He received many boons including a chariot that can travel anywhere at his wish. He ruled for a long time(85000 years as per the Puranas) with justice, prosperity, valor and strength. He even defeated the mighty king of Lanka - Ravana, single handedly. Once the King happened to visit the ashram of Rishi Jamadagni and was very impressed by his celestial cow Kamdhenu. The king asked the rishi to handover the cow to him, as he belived that such a celestial cow would be more useful to a Kshatriya than a rishi dwelling in the forest and living off on alms. A conflict rose and the sons of the king had the rishi beheaded after a series of unfortunate episodes. Parshuram was the son of rishi Jamadagni. He was also a portion avatar or ansh-avatar of lord Vishnu, born with only one-forth of the potency of Lord Vishnu. He not only defeated and killed King Kartavirya Arjuna but also annihilated the earth of the Kshatriyas twenty one times. Thus Parshuram humbled the Sudarshan Chakra but also grew very angry at the current social status of the Kshatriyas and started disliking them in general.

When I was 18, I hated Thatcher like everyone of my age, but politics is about maturity, rather than a set selection of beliefs. On that basis, I'll agree with most who've answered the question that abortion has nothing to do with the state. It's a decision for women alone, real ones, with wombs! Gun rights again is about responsible use. Vermin control needs a shotgun, security and military need their tools, but Kevin, who really wants a machine gun because of his low self esteem is not something I can support. UK gun control is a bit on the strict side, but it works well enough. The last two are difficult, because they are not simple soundbite answers, and need an ability to think to get my point. So there is nothing wrong with gay marriage and it should never be prevented however, it also should not be forced on a religion that doesn't agree with it. So Adam and Steve get married in the local registry office, and that's great. But Adam and Steve want the local Catholic church to do the honours, then I'm less likely to be supportive. If (Insert crazed religion here ) want to burn gays in (made up place of doom), that's their right too! Finally, the death penalty. Its a bad idea. You can't kill someone because they killed someone, and think your murder is justified when theirs wasn't. It's a logic maze of nonsense. Killing someone is wrong, and the best punishment is to remove them from society humanely. So there you have it. The reality of conservative thought in the UK, is it is similar to liberal thought of the previous generation. It isn't a set bunch of subjects you must agree on to be a member.

The reason that I talk a lot about this specific event is because the Great Leap Forward is one of the world’s most deadly man made disaster and the most devastating catastrophe in the world history of the twentieth century. Besides it also badly tainted the reputation of Mao Zedong being the hero and the founder of the People’s Republic of China who had just brought order and peace to the war-torn China by overthrowing the corrupt and ineffective KMT, the warlords, Japanese puppets and other remnants that seek to restore the already overthrown imperial rule. Mao Zedong was undeniably the main Chairman of the Communist Party of China(CPC) and founded the People's Republic of China since 1949 after the Chinese Civil War that saw the exodus of the remaining KMT forces led by Chiang Kai Shek to Taiwan For a while from that time on until in the year 1958, Mao had started his own Second Five Year Plan which would be eventually be known as the Great Leap Forward in which Mao urged even greater rapid development of China's agricultural and industrial sectors. This led to massive industrialization throughout the country. Since China used to be a Agrarian Society before the CCP victory took place, many people were forced to be removed from farmlands to work in industry in which the people have no to very little experiences working with iron and steel in which the backyard furnace were established to make steel. Because Mao himself had established the CCP rule in China, Mao himself ban on private holdings of farmland and started the collectivization of everything from farming system to people’s Communes to even child and family cares. And due to the collectivization, everything that are made out of metal were to be melted down to make steel in the backyard furnace and everything that are made out of wood were to be used as fuel to the fire. The results was that almost all of the metals being made were found to be unusable and ineffective and that most of them were being left to rust. Mao also started another campaign which was called as the Four Pests Campaign(1958) in which rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows were to be eliminated. As the result from the overkill of the sparrows, there weren’t enough of them to eat the insect that killed the crops and so the famine sets in was the result. Many people died in this catastrophe as it was said (in lowest estimate) that 45 million to 50 million people have perished due to famine and those that were still hungry were resumed to eating anything to everything that moved and the remaining plant lives that have not been damaged by the bugs. There were even reports of cannibalism during that horrific era. I felt the urge to prevent that era from happening somehow IF I have a big time machine to let me return back to the past. And the past that I am talking about here is this or a few years back before it happened. I do believe that many people would have told me to just kill Mao before he could launch his CCP campaign or just alter the victory in the favorite of the KMT but I felt that both of which are way too much far-fetched and far-reaching effects to what ends we would never know or it might have leads to something even more chaotic than the “previous” timeline. Besides any highly experienced history buff from the 21st century who wanted to prevent the Great Leap Forward from happening can just simply grab as many as those already simplified Chinese translated blueprints about advanced steel and iron mill industry and creating abundances of good agriculture and make it something like the 1910s Europe and 1930s Japan in larger scale. Besides it would have been easy for advanced people in today’s world to create and to own a blueprint of creating WWII era tanks, airplanes, and battleships in any and all forms. I as one of them will show him some of the many books and instructions like this: and also show him various blueprint about how to built those: they are all in English……I wish try to find a way to translate all of these into simplified Chinese SO this would not have happened: but this will happened instead and this would not have happened and this happens instead: And because of that China could have produced something like this on its own: this: this: and this: or even this: PLUS: someday if all of those can be successful I would even show Mao this: (of course, this all needs to be simplified Chinese so Mao may understand) BUT I need to show Mao Zedong this map As for the Cultural Revolution………. (http://Revolution……….it) I do not think this would happen if there was no Great Leap Forward….. Rather if I could stay with Mao long enough, maybe I would create ….something like….a “Cultural Restoration?”"},{"prompt":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","completion":"No. It is a highly risky proposition to invest in Crypto -currencies.

One common reason for the yo-yo effect is following restrictive or unsustainable diets that are difficult to maintain in the long term. When people return to their previous eating habits after finishing the diet, they often regain the weight they lost, and sometimes even more. To avoid this, it's important to follow a healthy and balanced diet that you can sustain over time. This means making gradual and sustainable changes to your eating habits, rather than following extreme or short-term diets. Similarly, it's important to have a sustainable and balanced exercise routine that you can maintain over time. Consistent exercise can help you maintain your weight by burning calories and building muscle, which can increase your metabolic rate. However, it's important to find a workout routine that you enjoy and can stick to over the long term, rather than pushing yourself too hard and risking burnout or injury. Gradually increasing your calorie intake can also help you maintain your weight, as long as you're still burning enough calories through exercise and maintaining a balanced diet. It's important to keep track of your calorie intake and to make sure you're still burning more calories than you're consuming, but not to restrict yourself too much or push yourself too hard. Overall, avoiding the yo-yo effect and maintaining your weight requires a sustainable and balanced approach to both diet and exercise. By making gradual and sustainable changes to your habits and finding a routine that works for you, you can achieve your weight goals in a healthy and sustainable way."},{"prompt":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

Volatility is measured in traditional markets by the Volatility Index, also known as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Volatility in Bitcoin does not yet have a generally accepted index since cryptocurrency as an asset class is still in its nascent stages, but we do know that Bitcoin is capable of volatility in the form of 10x changes in price versus the U.S. dollar, in a relatively short period of time. Here are just a few of the many factors behind Bitcoin's volatility: 1. Rate of adoption is hampered by bad press News events that scare Bitcoin users include geopolitical events and statements by governments that Bitcoin is likely to be regulated. Bitcoin's early adopters included several mal actors, producing headline news stories that produced fear in investors. Headline-making Bitcoin news includes the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox in early 2014 and more recently that of the South Korean exchange Yapian Youbit, and others like the high-profile use of Bitcoin in drug transactions via Silk Road that ended with the FBI shutdown of the marketplace in October 2013. All these incidents and the public panic that ensued drove the value of Bitcoins versus fiat currencies down rapidly. However, Bitcoin-friendly investors viewed those events as evidence that the market was maturing, driving the value of Bitcoins versus the dollar markedly back up in the short period immediately following the news events. 2. Bitcoin's perceived value fluctuates One reason why Bitcoin may fluctuate against fiat currencies is the perceived store of value versus the fiat currency. Bitcoin has properties that make it similar to gold. It is governed by a design decision by the developers of the core technology to limit its production to a fixed amount, 21 million BTC. Since that differs markedly from fiat currency, which is managed by governments who want to maintain low inflation, high employment, and satisfactory growth through investment in capital resources, as economies built with fiat currencies show signs of strength or weakness, investors may allocate more or less of their assets into Bitcoin. 3. Too much variance in perceptions of Bitcoin's store of value and method of value Bitcoin volatility is also driven in large part by varying perceptions of the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency as a store of value and method of value transfer. A store of value is the function by which an asset can be useful in the future with some predictability. A store of value can be saved and exchanged for some good or service in the future. A method of value transfer is any object or concept used to transmit property in the form of assets from one party to another. Bitcoin’s volatility at the present makes it a somewhat unclear store of value, but it promises nearly frictionless value transfer. Since these two drivers of the current spot price of Bitcoin vary against the dollar and other fiat currencies, we see that Bitcoin's value can swing based on news events much as we observe with fiat currencies. 4. Little option value to large holders of the currency Bitcoin volatility is also to an extent driven by holders of large proportions of the total outstanding float of the currency. For Bitcoin investors with current holdings above around 10M, it is not clear how they would liquidate a position that large into a fiat position without severely moving the market. Since Bitcoin’s volume resembles a small cap stock, the currency has not hit the mass market adoption rates that would be necessary to provide option value to large holders of the currency. 5. News about security breaches make investors react Bitcoin can also become volatile when the Bitcoin community exposes security vulnerabilities in an effort to produce massive open source responses in the form of security fixes. This approach to security is paradoxically one that produces great outcomes, with many valuable open source software initiatives to its credit, including Linux. Bitcoin developers must reveal security concerns to the public in order to produce robust solutions. It was a hack that drove the Yapian Youbit to bankruptcy, while NiceHash too reported 70 million worth of Bitcoin stolen in a recent attack on the platform. In April 2014, the OpenSSL vulnerabilities attacked by the Heartbleed bug and reported by Google security's Neel Mehta drove Bitcoin prices down by 10% in a month. Bitcoin and open source software development are built upon the same fundamental premise that a copy of the source code is free for users to examine and modify at will. This concept makes it the responsibility of the community to voice concerns about the software design, and when the community does so, the value of Bitcoin reflects the level of confidence in the protocol design as a whole. It is only natural then that the value would fluctuate with news events about security breaches. 6. Bitcoin’s high profile losses at are another driver of volatility It is worth noting that these losses and the ensuing news about the losses had a double effect on volatility. They reduced the overall float of Bitcoin by approximately, producing a potential lift on the value of the remaining Bitcoin due to increased scarcity. However, overriding this lift was the negative effect of the news cycle that followed. Notably, other Bitcoin gateways looked to the massive failure at Mt Gox as a positive for the long term prospects of Bitcoin, further complicating the already complex story behind the currency’s volatility. As early adopting firms are eliminated from the market due to poor management and dysfunctional processes, later entrants learn from their errors and build stronger processes into their own operations, strengthening the infrastructure of the currency overall. 7.Bitcoin and foreign direct investment in countries with high inflation Bitcoin’s use case as a currency for the developing countries that are currently experiencing high inflation is valuable when considering the volatility of Bitcoin in these economies versus the volatility of Bitcoin in US. Bitcoin is much more volatile versus the USD than the high inflation Argentine peso versus the US. That being said, the near frictionless transfer of Bitcoins across borders makes it a potentially highly attractive borrowing instrument for Argentineans, as the high inflation rate for peso denominated loans potentially justifies taking on some intermediate currency volatility risk in a Bitcoin denominated loan funded outside Argentina. Similarly, funders outside Argentina can earn a higher return under this scheme than they can using debt instruments denominated in their home currency, potentially offsetting some of the risk of exposure to the high inflation Argentine market. 8. Tax treatment of Bitcoin also affects the volatility Recent announcements by the IRS stating that the currency is actually an asset for tax purposes had mixed effects on volatility. On the upside, any statement recognizing the currency has a positive effect on the market valuation of the currency. Conversely, on the downside, the decision by the IRS to call it property had two negative effects. The first was the added complexity for users who want to pay with it. Under the new tax law, users would have to record the market value of the currency at the time of every transaction, no matter how small. This can understandably slow adoption as it seems to be too much trouble for what it is worth for many users. Secondly, the decision to call the currency a form of property for tax purposes may be a signal to some market participants that the IRS is preparing to enforce stronger regulations later. Very strong regulation of the currency could cause the adoption rate of the currency to slow to the point where it is not able to achieve the mass adoption that is critical for its overall utility in society. Recent moves by the IRS are not clear as to their signaling motives and therefore have mixed signals to the market for Bitcoin.

Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a variety of asset classes, making them suitable for individuals with different risk tolerances and investment objectives. Here are some mutual fund themes you can consider when exploring the best ways to invest your money: Index Funds: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. These funds provide broad market exposure and generally have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. Index funds are an excellent option for passive investors who seek steady returns and want to track the overall market performance.Large-Cap Equity Funds: Large-cap equity funds invest in the stocks of well-established and financially stable companies with large market capitalizations. These funds focus on blue-chip companies known for their track records and stability. Large-cap equity funds offer a balance between growth potential and reduced volatility.Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Equity Funds: Mid-cap and small-cap equity funds invest in the stocks of companies with medium to small market capitalizations. These funds have the potential for higher growth but also carry higher volatility. Mid-cap and small-cap equity funds are suitable for investors with a higher risk tolerance who are willing to embrace potential market fluctuations.Value Funds: Value funds invest in stocks that are considered undervalued based on various fundamental indicators, such as low price-to-earnings ratio or price-to-book ratio. [LINKED_TEXT: Value funds ] [URL: https://www.franklintempletonindia.com/fund-details/fund-overview/629/templeton-india-value-fund-erstwhile-templeton-india-growth-fund]focus on finding bargains in the market and aim for long-term capital appreciation as the market recognizes the true value of these stocks.Growth Funds: Growth funds invest in stocks of companies expected to exhibit above-average growth rates compared to their peers or the overall market. These funds typically invest in companies operating in sectors with high growth potential, such as technology, healthcare, or consumer discretionary. Growth funds are suitable for investors seeking capital appreciation over a longer time horizon.Sector-Specific Funds: Sector-specific funds concentrate their investments in a particular industry or sector, such as technology, energy, healthcare, or real estate. These funds allow investors to capitalize on the growth potential of specific sectors they believe in. However, it's important to note that sector funds can be more volatile and carry higher risks compared to diversified funds.International or Global Funds: International or global funds provide exposure to companies located outside your home country. These funds offer the opportunity to diversify geographically and gain exposure to different economies and market trends. International or global funds can enhance portfolio diversification and potentially provide higher returns.Hybrid Funds: Hybrid funds, also known as balanced funds, invest in a mix of equities and fixed-income securities. These funds offer diversification across asset classes and aim for both capital appreciation and income generation.[LINKED_TEXT: Hybrid funds] [URL: https://www.franklintempletonindia.com/funds-and-solutions/funds-explorer/hybrid-funds] can be suitable for investors seeking a balanced approach with moderate risk."},{"prompt":"Did Pfizer purposely hold back on announcing a vaccine for COVID19 in order to hurt Trump’s chances of winning the election?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Azar says Pfizer \\"very much part\\" of Operation Warp Speed after it distanced itself from Trump program] [URL: https://www.newsweek.com/pfizer-part-operation-warp-speed-alex-azar-distanced-trump-program-1546594]"},{"prompt":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","completion":"A submarine is a complex machine that operates underwater for long periods of time. One of the challenges of submarine design is how to deal with the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced by the crew and the engines. CO2 is a gas that can cause health problems and even death if it accumulates in high concentrations. Therefore, submarines need a way to remove CO2 from the air and prevent it from building up inside the vessel. There are different methods that submarines use to eliminate CO2, depending on their type and technology. Some of the most common ones are: - Scrubbers: These are devices that use chemical reactions to absorb CO2 from the air and convert it into harmless substances, such as water and sodium carbonate. Scrubbers are usually installed in the ventilation system of the submarine and require regular maintenance and replenishment of chemicals. - Electrolysis: This is a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is used to replenish the air supply, while the hydrogen is either vented out or stored for later use. Electrolysis also reduces the amount of CO2 in the air, since water is one of the products of combustion. - Carbon capture and storage: This is a technique that involves capturing CO2 from the air and storing it in a solid or liquid form, such as calcium carbonate or liquid CO2. This method requires advanced technology and large storage tanks, but it has the advantage of reducing the weight and volume of CO2 on board. These are some of the ways that submarines manage to keep their air quality safe and comfortable for their crew and passengers. Submarines are remarkable examples of engineering and innovation that allow humans to explore and operate in the underwater environment."},{"prompt":"w do you create social media creative content?","completion":"To create successful social media content there are numerous methods available; nevertheless, what works best for someone varies depending on their intentions, target viewership and resources at hand.

They are often suitable for long-term investors.Long-term perspective: Investing with a long-term view allows for the benefit of compound interest and the ability to weather short-term market fluctuations. This approach is particularly relevant for retirement savings and other long-term goals.Research and staying informed: Taking the time to educate oneself about various investment options and staying updated with market trends is essential. This knowledge enables informed decision-making and adjustments to investment strategies.Professional advice: Seeking guidance from a financial advisor can be valuable, especially for novice investors or those with complex financial needs. They can provide personalized advice based on individual goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.Investing in personal development: Recognizing the importance of investing in one's own knowledge, skills, and personal growth is crucial. Enhancing abilities can potentially increase earning potential and create new financial opportunities. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and returns are not guaranteed.

I loathe the flood of machine generated questions. I also dislike the questions where people are peddling stuff under multiple sock-puppet accounts and that a simple fine-tuning of the filters would say “Aha, they mentioned >this< product again; delete the post and the sock-puppet account” and Quora Does Not Do That apparently. On a personal note, I’ll get tagged periodically for some infraction or other in my answer with the generic “I have read and understood the rules” checkbox, and the problem is that it doesn’t mean sour owl shit. Sure, there are a few cases where it’s clear that I was being disrespectful but in many other cases and that’s a fair reaction, but in the vast majority of cases, what I said did not apply to the person asking the question at all (and was phrased carefully to make that clear), and the QuoraBots still got unhappy. (I have appealed these and sometimes gotten my answer restored, which suggests that my perceptions are more correct than not.) My favorite one, though, was that I apparently offended some Christian fundamentalists who didn’t like my historically accurate commentary on where the Trinity comes from and its association with other dying/reborn agricultural gods of that time and place. There’s not a single thing in it that’s anywhere close to BNBR, but I got the answer removed, presumably through downvotes. Can I find out what the real “problem” was? Oh, hellz, no.

And if you tell the school you’re planning to get police involved, they are quick to want to solve the issue. When my my son was in kindergarten, him and his brother who was in 2nd grade use to ride the bus to grandpas after school and I’d pick them up an hour later. I walked in one day to find my kindergartener pouting on the couch. Figured he’d got in trouble until my dad said “show your mom” my son was “student of the week” they send home a pig paper to fill out about your kid favorite color favorite book siblings pets etc. I’m sure you’ve seen them. A 5th grade boy on the bus had drawn penises and wrote some foul things all over it. I called the school Monday and explained why we didn’t do it. They sent home a new paper and said they would talk with the boys who had done it. 3 days later the same kid had taken my sons backpack and wouldn’t give it back. We never got the backpack back, the school said they would talk to him. The next week he took my sons shoes while on the bus and the bus driver had to get them back while 5th graders taunted him for being a crybaby about his shoes. On Friday my kindergartener got off the bus wailing and holding his face. The 5th header had punched him in the face for “tattling” my father did not wait to inform me. He loaded both kids into his truck and headed for the school. I feel like I should say, my dad is a Vietnam vet. he’s a big man and he can be very intimidating. He’s also got a booming voice that carries well. When he got to the school he was informed that there was no one available to meet with him they were in meetings. My dad loudly explained that someone would talk to him, or he’d call the sheriff to the school and report the kid to have him picked up for assault. And the kids parents could deal with the court system and that further, since the school had opted to not handle the situation, he would be pressing charges against the school and the principal personally for child neglect and endangerment. The principal made time to talk to him suddenly. She explained that there was little to be done, they didn’t have an interpreter at the school and the parents spoke very limited English. They couldn’t remove the other child from the bus because it would cause his family a hardship as neither parent could drive. My father whipped out his cellphone and called the sheriff station right there in the office. By the time the cops got to the school, the school was trying to find an interpreter and get hold of the other boys parents at the same time. The cops took a report, found a Spanish speaking officer and headed to the other boys home. Turns out the family was undocumented and it took a pretty shitty turn for that family after the police visited. I’ve used this a couple of other times also. If you tell the school you are getting the police involved, they suddenly care. Or skip telling them. If you or your child is being assaulted, you are not required to report it to the school first. You are within your rights to call the police and seek legal justice against your attacker."},{"prompt":"w do I combine Word documents into a PDF?","completion":"Why bother with steps and tricks, simply use one of the online Word to PDF converter, here we suggest a few of the best and [LINKED_TEXT: 100% free online words to pdf converter] [URL: https://fileproinfo.com/tools/converter/DOCX].

Her mom called him to come back in room or he would fall sick. He didn't care about anything and kept playing there until she slapped him and took back to room. This incident reminded my childhood. I hail from a small village in my district where baisc amenities were not available before. We weren't nourished up like nowadays kids are being. There were not too much worries. We used to play together without any discrimination like don't play with this kid or don't talk to xyz kids. It wer never an issue. We used to fight a lot but at the end of day again gossiping and laughing together. We didn't know what germs are called. Whether it was first rain or stormy one, we played in it crazily. Our noises disturbed elders before frogs could break their silence. Dusk and mud were our powder and cream. We were unaware if we will fall sick or not. Even if we're sick, our legs and hands were never in control when some would be playing around us. We were beaten a lot too for committing silly and heavy mistakes. But who took it on heart if parents or someone beat us. We used to come up with new troubles very next. There were no future worrier us. It was a short glimpse of my childhood that I spent with others kids around me in my village. Now, Coming back to question. Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people? In this generation, people are more worried for their future about which they don't have any clue. They have forgotten to enjoy their beautiful present in the worrisome of delusion future. Don't eat sugar or you will be fat, avoid salt or you will be a patient of blood pressure. Stressed and depressed for intaking meals. Too many choices have left us in a doubt that what would be better for us. Our standards are more important to us than the thing we really need. Wouldn't it be a shame if I make that person my friend? Will not they mock me if I don't wear this special kind of brand and so on. We have restricted ourselves for the things which make us happy. In the name of maturity, we have made our live too tough. Such maturity is too toxic and depressing which depart us from living a peaceful live.

My Take on the Future of Crypto I am a seasoned investor and cryptocurrency enthusiast, I’ve been closely following the crypto market over the past decade. There have been a lot of ups and downs, but 2022 was undoubtedly a catastrophic year for cryptocurrencies. The market lost a staggering 2 trillion in value, and the collapse of the FTX exchange left many investors reeling. However, I believe that this year could be pivotal for the future of cryptocurrency. As companies and investors brace themselves for more scrutiny and regulation, we may see a shift towards more established institutions taking over the blockchain infrastructure. Cryptography and blockchains will continue to be integral parts of the modern economic toolkit, and the long-term outlook for the industry remains solid. So, is it worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies in 2023? Let's take a look at some top predictions to watch out for: Bear Market Will Be Over at the Beginning of 2023Some experts predict that we’re currently experiencing a crypto decline, which will probably hit its bottom by the end of 2022. These predictions are also made by the past performance of the crypto market, which suggests that in the next three months, the bear market will come to an end. It is one of the top 10 cryptocurrency predictions that investors should follow in 2023. A Lot More Investors Will Adopt BitcoinAccording to The Ascent, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, predicts that more than 500 million people worldwide will own Bitcoin by the end of 2023. The improved understanding of the industry and regulatory clarity are expected to drive greater adoption. This is one of the top 10 cryptocurrency predictions that investors should follow in 2023. Don’t Count Out NFTsNFTs were all the rage in 2022, and despite the market downturn, they are expected to recover next year. Brands will continue to flock to NFTs, and we may see major investments from both Web2 and Web3 brands, such as Starbucks and Disney. The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Get ApprovedSome crypto investors predict that the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States could be approved this year, giving investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency itself. The market is now large and mature enough to support it, and analysts believe that a Bitcoin Spot ETF will be approved. Ether Will Outperform Bitcoin AgainEther outperformed Bitcoin in 2021, gaining 418 percent compared to 66 percent for Bitcoin. Analysts believe that ether will continue to do well because of the surge in NFT sales volumes. Most of these tokens still run on the ethereum blockchain. Despite these predictions, it's important to remember that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and risky investments. It’s essential to do your research and invest only what you can afford to lose. If you're new to cryptocurrency investing, it's best to start with small amounts and gradually build up your portfolio. In the world of cryptocurrency, security is a top concern for investors. With the rise of cyberattacks and exchange hacks, investors are becoming increasingly wary of keeping their digital assets on platforms that are not secure enough. This is where BTCC comes in. BTCC is a cryptocurrency exchange that has proven to be one of the most secure platforms for trading digital assets. With its robust security protocols and advanced encryption technology, BTCC has never suffered a major security breach since its establishment. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow in 2023, investors will be looking for a reliable and secure platform to buy and sell their digital assets. This is where BTCC will shine. Its reputation for security will make it a popular choice among investors who want to ensure their assets are safe from cyber threats. In conclusion, while the past year has been a tough one for cryptocurrencies, I believe that the industry will regroup in 2023, with those still standing ready for a big push heading into 2024. The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, but it's clear that cryptography and blockchains will continue to shape the modern economic landscape. Whether it's worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies is up to each individual investor to decide."},{"prompt":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","completion":"QUESTION : Is Bangladesh a far more prosperous country than Pakistan?

I'm gonna tell you about a path that one should follow in order to become good at competitive programming but again remember one thing there is no such magic involved in it. It includes a lot of dedicated hard work and most importantly consistency. The biggest problem that everyone faces while seeing these competitive programming questions is people will freeze out immediately and thinks that they are not made for it probably they are not good programmers or probably they might think that their ability is not that high. There is a very big reason why you're thinking out like that why you're freezing out like that now let's do a fun experiment just imagine this situations take-up any student from fifth or sixth standard who is good at science teach him the laws of motion and the equation of laws of motion now take that student and give him JEE Mains paper of that which includes the question from these laws of motion what he's going to feel in those questions he's going to feel that Even though he knows these laws of motion still not able to crack down these questions as they are based on the same concept so he's going to feel that there is something wrong with him probably he is not smart enough but we all know that the problem is not about the smartness the problem is he just knows that syntax of that equation(formulas) he was never prepared gradually to crack down those tough levels of questions Coming to competitive programming it is happening the same when you see the questions on CodeChef, Codeforces, Atcoder, etc If you are unable to solve them exactly the same is happening just like the above situation Just by knowing the programming syntax and some basic loops and functions and seeing those questions which are really tough we are getting fries out and questioning our capability The most important thing that one should learn while solving questions is that they should move gradually so that you can crack down those problems. HOW TO GET STARTED WITH COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING ?? 1)Learn one language perfectly Taking any language would be fine but I personally suggest going with C++ because C++ contains STL which has built-in functions and these functions are fast compared to other programming built-in functions mostly many editorials and solutions of competitive coding contests are in C++. Even If you have started with another programming language it’s fine. C++ is faster than other programming languages in producing the results which are a plus for competitive coders. 2)Choose one platform to practice questions Keep solving easy-level problems first and then keep on leveling up. Some best platforms are as follows TopCoderCoderbyteHackerearthCodeChefCode studio 3)Participate in contests Many platforms keep conducting contests so try to participate in those contests. Don’t do contests for ratings Do contests to improve your skills. Some best platforms are as follows CodestudioTopCoderCoderbyteHackerearthCodeChefCodeforcesAtcoder Never worry about ratings do remember only one thing that you are solving questions to improve your skills.

It's time to address a common misconception that has hindered many women from embracing their full potential: the notion that low testosterone levels make it impossible to build muscle. Today, we're going to debunk this myth, turn it on its head, and show you how to sculpt that gorgeous physique you've always dreamed of, all while having a good laugh along the way. So, let's dive right into the world of female muscle buildin! Hitting the Weights: Overcoming Low Testosterone Alright, ladies, let's address the elephant in the room: testosterone. Traditionally seen as the almighty hormone responsible for muscle growth, it's often portrayed as the secret ingredient to Hulk-like gains. But let me ask you this: does having a low testosterone level mean you can't build muscle? Absolutely not! Let's put it in perspective. Imagine you're hosting a potluck dinner. The star of the show is usually the main course, right? Well, in the world of muscle building, testosterone may be considered the main course, but that doesn't mean the side dishes (other hormones) can't shine. While women typically have lower testosterone levels than men, they have their own secret sauce called estrogen, which plays a significant role in muscle preservation and growth. Estrogen: The Hidden Hero Estrogen, often seen as the \\"feminine\\" hormone, deserves a standing ovation for its muscle-building prowess. Like a well-orchestrated dance routine, estrogen teams up with other hormones, such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to promote muscle protein synthesis and enhance recovery. So, even with lower testosterone levels, ladies, you've got an ace up your sleeve! But wait, there's more! Estrogen helps maintain bone health, which is essential for overall strength and stability. It's like having a solid foundation for a beautiful house. You can't build a sturdy structure without a strong base, and estrogen ensures your skeletal system is ready to support the muscle gains you'll achieve. Train Smart: The Magic of Resistance Training Now that we understand the hormonal dynamics, let's talk about the most important tool in your muscle-building arsenal: resistance training. Picture this: you're driving a car, and resistance training is the gas that fuels your journey to muscular glory. With a well-designed workout plan, you can rev up your engine and unlock your true potential. When you engage in resistance training, whether it's with weights, resistance bands, or your body weight, you create micro-tears in your muscle fibers. These tears act as a signal to your body, prompting it to repair and strengthen the damaged tissue. Over time, with consistent training and proper nutrition, your muscles adapt and grow stronger, defying the limits imposed by testosterone levels. Nutrition: Fueling Your Inner Fire Now, ladies, let's talk about feeding the fire within. Just like a car needs the right fuel to keep running smoothly, your body needs proper nutrition to support muscle growth. But before you start picturing chicken breasts and broccoli for every meal, let's get one thing straight: you don't have to eat like a Spartan warrior to build muscle. Instead, focus on consuming a well-rounded diet that includes lean protein sources like chicken, fish, tofu, or beans. Carbohydrates provide the energy needed to power through those intense workouts, so don't shy away from healthy options like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. And let's not forget about the good fats! Avocados and nuts can provide essential nutrients for hormone production and overall health. Remember, building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. It's important to listen to your body and give it the rest and recovery it needs. Adequate sleep, hydration, and stress management are crucial elements of the muscle-building equation. So, don't be afraid to pamper yourself and prioritize self-care along the way. You deserve it! Unleash Your Inner Wonder Woman Ladies, it's time to shatter the myth that low testosterone levels can hold you back from building muscle. Embrace your unique hormonal balance, leverage the power of resistance training, nourish your body with proper nutrition, and cultivate a mindset of unwavering belief in your abilities. Now, go forth, conquer, and flex on, my strong and fearless queens! You've got this!

Friendship can be a real safety net in times where you have no spouse, your parents don’t understand you because of the generational differences, your children might have gone away and create their own life. In a deeper, more spiritual sense, friendship is a mirror of how well we really communicate with people, with those we don’t share the sexual attraction, the money, the same family name with. Basically, we are completely independent from them in a material world. But can we bond with people more spiritually?

Bhagat Singh belongs to Indian Sanatana Satanana Sanatani Hindu Sikh Sri Vaishnava Khatri Kshatri Kshatriya community to which all the ten Indian Hindu Sikh Sri Vaishnava Gurus such as Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Ram Dev, Guru Kishan Dev, Guru Arjun Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Tegbahadur, Guru Harkishan Dev, Guru Harigovind Dev, and Guru Gobind Singh belong.

Once the British destroyed the Sikh Hindu Empire by defeating the Sikh Hindu kingdom, Khatris lost much of their status, power, and money, and since they had to take to commerce and trade as the British and Indian princely states did not deliberately or due to the fear of incurring the enmity of the Briitsh, Khatris were also treated as belonging to Vaishya caste. So, the Veer Dheer Shoor Kshatriya Khatris, the pride of all Hindus, including Sikh Hindus of India, and the true patriots of India, are now also called as Kshatriya Vaishya community, in the same as Agarwals, the true Kshatriyas of India, the former rulers of India, the descendants of Ayodhya Sri Ram, and empire builders of India, who lost their empires to the invading Muslim rulers from Afghanistan, Iran (also known as Persia), Khazakstan, Uzbekistan, and Arab countries and later to the European British, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Dutch Roman Catholic and Protestant Christian colonizer rulers of India, took to business, commerce, and trade, and became known as Kshatriya Agarwals, or Kshatriya Vaishya Agarwals of India, who are found throughout northern, central and western India, mainly in the states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Bansals, Kejriwals, Bansalis, Kucchals, Kansals, Goels, Goyals, Goyans, Gargs, Mittals, Jindals, Dharans, Singhals, Tingals, Tayals, Mangals, Bhandals, Nagals, Airans, and Madhukuls are the different groups of Indian Hindu Kshatriya Vaishya Sri Vaishnava men, women, and children belonging to the Agarwal Kshatriya Vaishya community of India.

This can potentially shift your body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. However, it's important to approach the keto diet safely and mindfully. Here's how you can incorporate the keto diet for rapid weight loss: Carbohydrate Restriction: Limit your daily carbohydrate intake to a very low level, typically around 20-50 grams per day. This forces your body to rely on fat stores for energy.High Fat Intake: Increase your consumption of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish. These fats will provide the majority of your daily calorie intake.Moderate Protein: Consume moderate amounts of protein from sources like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy. Excessive protein intake can potentially interfere with ketosis, so it's important to balance it.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and support your body's adaptation to ketosis.Limit Processed Foods: While the focus is on fats, it's still essential to choose whole, minimally processed foods to ensure you're getting essential nutrients.Plan Meals Carefully: Create a meal plan that aligns with keto guidelines. Meals should consist of a combination of healthy fats, protein, and a small amount of carbohydrates from low-carb vegetables.Monitor Ketosis: You can use keto strips or a blood ketone meter to monitor whether your body has entered a state of ketosis. Keep in mind that individual responses may vary.Exercise: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine, such as aerobic exercises and strength training. Exercise can help enhance weight loss and overall health.Consult a Professional: Before starting the keto diet, especially for rapid weight loss, consider consulting a healthcare provider or registered dietitian. They can offer personalized guidance and monitor your health.Potential Challenges: It's important to note that the keto diet can be challenging to maintain long-term and may lead to nutrient deficiencies if not planned carefully. Some people also experience the \\"keto flu\\" during the initial transition period.Gradual Transition: If you're new to the keto diet, consider gradually reducing carbohydrates over a week or two to minimize the initial side effects.[LINKED_TEXT: CLICK HERE FOR THE ULTIMATE DIET PLAN] [URL: https://tinyurl.com/4w8pemyz]"},{"prompt":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","completion":"Liposuction is a type of cosmetic and [LINKED_TEXT: plastic surgery] [URL: https://www.shobhitaesthetics.com/] that removes excess fat from your body.

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

The US forces now are pretty much standardized on the NATO rounds which I assume will work in the other NATO partners weapons , not so with the warsaw pact group ( only among themselves I would venture to guess), so why risk it? the guns themselves could be booby-trapped ."},{"prompt":"f the Avengers Hulk fought King Kong, who would win?","completion":"Hulk, easily. Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"prompt":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","completion":"Physical violence being betrayed by the one who you live and thought was on your side is devastating, devastating to learn they put a target on your back, put you down by obfuscating context, like you’re larking around having fun, the other half presents it to her friends as a source of ridicule.

As aloe vera and jade plants are both succulents, use a well-draining potting mix, such as those made for cacti and succulents.

These are the opening words for the Spanish novel “El Capitán Alatriste”, the first of a series of novels that tell the story of Diego Alatriste y Tenorio, a Spanish soldier in the decaying Spanish Empire of the XVII century. The line is perfect, in that it tells you almost everything you need to know about the character. He wasn’t the most honest, meaning he was willing to be a little shady, but he wasn’t entirely dishonest. He wasn’t the most merciful, but he sometimes acted with mercy. But whatever the case, he was brave beyond doubt. This is a perfect description of the character of Captain Alatriste (who, by the way, is no captain at all, just a plain soldier, but he was so brave in battle, that they gave him the moniker “Captain” and everyone calls him that way… even his superior officers!). He struggles through the hardships of life of a retired soldier in a decaying Empire, while trying to make a living and at the same time taking care of the son of one of his best friends in the army, who died in the arms of the Captain and made him promise to take care of his son. Fantastic series of novels. I just wish the author would one day finish them… They even made a movie, with Viggo Mortensen as Captain Alatriste."},{"prompt":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","completion":"If you ask any tasteless on film Indian fan/Pakistani fan / Bangladeshi fan, yes they will say. But you need to understand vast majority of Indian cinema audiance is totally backwarded and binge into cheap commercial films, I am not saying this the true one of the greatest film-maker Satyajit Ray once said this in one his interviews. Indian film awards are totally biased and has no international recognition. The awards are no parameter to judge. Akshay Kumar had already revealed the real face of it in Aap ki Aadalat show. He is just an average or bellow average skilled actor. But the audience is totally backward mentality possessed people who made him a super star of the fool people. How many peope know Shahrukh khan outside Indian and Pakistan? Even in other developed muslim countries he is totally unknown. He is searched naked in the US airports. No one gives a damn about Bollywood and their so called stars. Because in Bollywood originality and talent does not get praised or chance.

Even at the peak of its empire called the USSR, it claimed it was a power solely based upon the military it couldn’t afford, and the nukes it could threaten to destroy others with. The main problem it had was having to work SO hard to keep its citizens in-country and working for the common good. They wasted a LOT of money trying to control everything in and around Russia, money that was easily “lost” and placed in some guy’s pockets so HE could have a marginally better life: To “H” with everyone else. Corruption and lack of personal investment in Russia was, and is, rampant, endemic, part of everyday life in Russia. That limits their ability to grow as a power immensely. The Russians I’ve worked with over the years — we have a fairly large Russian community— were dedicated and hard-working (in the US), but had just “skated by” in Russia because there was no benefit in excelling. THAT makes a world of difference and dooms Russia to remain a 3rd-class power unless and until Russians really get behind the idea of excelling at whatever they do. As my parents said when I was just a tyke:”If you’re a trash man, be the BEST trash man there ever was!” IOW, EXCEL at everything you do!

It’s quite common for babies to have minor skin problems from birth: dry skin, redness, irritation, bumps, diaper rash. Many children go through all these stages. So if you thought babies had flawless skin, you’re probably feeling a little distraught! Since newborn skin is especially fragile, parents are quick to seek the best products to minimize these small skin problems. But what exactly does your child need? How can you choose the best products for your little one? And most importantly, what can we really find in the formulas of baby products available on the market? Since delicate baby skin loses moisture more quickly than adults and its protective layer does not renew itself as quickly, many parents are looking for ultra-gentle, perfume-free, hypoallergenic products specially formulated for a newborn’s epidermis. However, none of the parents in our survey said they looked at the product label, namely because it’s difficult to make sense of the ingredient list. Products aimed specifically at babies are not necessarily the best for their skin and health. They may contain ingredients that are just as concerning as those found in household products and personal care products for adults. The many ingredients of concern found in most [LINKED_TEXT: baby products] [URL: https://funfamilygeneral.shop/] can penetrate their delicate skin’s natural protective barrier and be easily absorbed into their body. Children are more vulnerable to the effects of contaminants than adults because they receive greater exposure. They are on average ten times more vulnerable before the age of two because they eat, drink and breathe more frequently, proportional to their weight."},{"prompt":"What are some hobbies that will heal an INFJ?","completion":"Here are some that have helped me. They are pretty universal & not limited to an INFJ personality. We are prone to being overly analytical to the point of despair & ennuie. Our penchant to dive deep into our subconscious mind & obtuse philosophical concepts can lead to some pretty stark & angst ridden realizations. It's important for us to climb out of the cave to “look out & smell the roses\\" every so often. I'm one who's guilty of descending so far into the abyss, releasing all the monsters from the proverbial hell within. Now, they're intimate pals I occasionally let out if they behave. I've come a long way. Hobbies that give us the time & focus to sort out the weird maze & landscape of our internal life are truly beneficial. Things like: Journaling - or any writing pursuit (Answering questions on Quora?)Engaging in (or learning new) artistic creative disciplines or criticism: painting, music, creative writing, photography, etc. Taking up a new musical instrument.(even just partaking at a museum or going to the symphony) I volunteered as an art docent for several years.Some use digital media for therapeutic effect. Like coding, or minecraft. I had a H.S. algebra teacher who claimed she would do quadratic equations in the evenings because she enjoyed the puzzle of it??? (I don't think she was an INFJ.) Taking part in activities that get us out in nature where we can release pent up anxiety & stressors. The science is bountiful on exercise being good for stress reduction i.e. lower blood pressure, circulation, cortisol reducing-mood stabilization, weight loss, the list goes on. Probably going solo giving us time to ourselves & to recharge our batteries from the overwhelm we commonly experience is better suited to our personality for therapeutic effect. Activities include: Running, cycling & hiking, rock-climbing, GeocachingYoga, martial-arts, hip-hop dance classesSwimming, rowing, canoeingArchery Team sports are also good, but they won't have the rejuvinating effect of more individualistic activities. Having addressed the body, addressing the mind is essential as well: Learning & practicing meditation in a form that suits us.Reading about philosophical & psychological theories. These are broad subjects that can pique certain interests in physics & metaphysics, ethics, law, economy, ecology, etc. Listening to audio books or podcasts about these subjects.If your religous, really engaging in the moralistic & spiritual aspects of your religion. Opening up to other religious viewpoints to enhance your own. If you're atheistic, delving into science & the philosophies of skepticism & epistemology works much the same way.Read, read… & read some more! You can never learn too much. Of course we can find things that kill two birds. We of all people know that the mind-body problem is just a convienient illusion. Deeper insight into this shows that our intimate friends & relationships are a refuge in where we can go to heal as well."},{"prompt":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","completion":"The story of Sloane McGregor and the blue stones that are the navel to the world."},{"prompt":"By what right did Sweden enter NATO without Russia's consent?","completion":"Idiots with smart phones.

And yes, before anyone asks, I’m willing to pay a little more also. I’m perfectly willing to go back to Bill Clinton’s taxation rates, which gave us a nice budget surplus. And, we can raise the corporate tax rate back up, and the taxes wealthy people must pay. Our economy boomed under these tax rates in the 90s. Let’s wind down the wars—which Obama started to do. That’s a vast expense too. We spend more on the military than the next several nations combined. I’m sure we would be just fine if we only spent more than the next highest. Funny—Republicans never ask how they are going to pay for their massively expensive multi-trillion dollar wars and their grossly inflated military spending, and their tax cuts for the wealthy (yes, those have to be paid for somehow too). They don’t ask how we pay for it when it comes to killing people—only when we spend money on helping people—then, it’s “gee, how can we afford this?”"},{"prompt":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","completion":"Before I gave birth to my youngest child, I as working in a high pace, high stress position. I had been full time there for years, with tons of experience, great work ethic, and even did an extra “job” within the job that no one else wanted to do. I’m what I would call an exemplary employee. I work for a very large company, and my position is held in many different areas of the company. When I got pregnant, I had scaled back to ‘as needed’, because I could no longer meet the full time demands, which included working 24 hour shifts and 50–60 hour work weeks, weekends, etc. In that, I WANTED to work full time and did maintain full time hours for a period of time, but being classified as ‘as needed’, I lost ALL my benefits, including the over 200 hours of extended sick leave I had earned over 5 and a half years of employment. I knew if I went back full time within 1 year, I would get my 200 hours back, which I needed in order to have paid maternity leave… I applied for a transfer to a better department, which had a much better schedule, more relaxed work environment, and no weekend/overnight requirements. My application for transfer was ignored for WEEKS, while the position remained open. I called the HR recruiter over that department multiple times, and my calls were ignored. I finally went above her, inquiring why I hadn’t been selected for an interview. I just wanted to know why… I was called about 24 hours later for an interview and was told that the hiring manager wasn’t ‘motivated’ to hire, but I was given an interview. I wasn’t selected. At that point, I was about 4 months pregnant, and it was noticeable. I can only assume that’s why I didn’t get selected, because the hiring manager told me to let her know right away if I wanted the job and I responded the same day that I wanted it, but wasn’t selected. The job was taken down and reposted less than 2 days later. Fast forward to 6 months after I gave birth. I had no paid maternity leave, had to quit my job so I could cash out my 401k just to have something to subsidize our income while I was off work. We were in a really bad position financially. I started looking for a new job, and still needed something that worked better for a young family. When I was on line looking, I saw the SAME job posted again. What irony. Still hadn’t filled that position? Or the last hire didn’t work out? I took a stab in the dark, applied for the job, and got called THE NEXT DAY. I interviewed, and was offered the job 2 hours later. Nothing had changed on my end. I still had the same amount of experience, same education, etc. I’ve been here 4 months now, and I’ve joked with my manager about how she could have had me this whole time.

With that said, there are a few things to note: Logistically, it’d be impossible to take everyone’s guns (it seems even some Americans forget just how damn big our country is)No legislation has been passed or brought to a vote that intends to take gunsLegislation has been brought to a vote and/or passed to limit the availability of guns & gun types, who can purchase them (i.e., prohibiting felons, those with mental health issues, domestic abusers, etc.), and where guns may be taken A lot of the above has already been enacted but usually poorly enforced. In some areas (mostly red states) the laws have been reduced over the years to allow weapons in more people’s hands quickly (see Texas as an example by removing 200+ million to screen for and support mental health despite Gov. Abbotts’s promises to the opposite) and allow them broader range of where they may take them (churches, bars, etc.). If anything, recent years have put guns in more hands than not. If people actually paid attention instead of watching scare-tactic TV shows they might see that and stress less about people coming to get their guns and worry that there are some seriously unstable people out there with guns that otherwise would have been prevented to have them. Just because this issue and the amount of ignorance of gun owners to want to abide by any sort of sensible precaution, it’s fun to point out that guns are the leading cause of death for school children in Texas now and more than 2/3 of women killed in relationships are due to gun violence (this is a nod to the domestic abuser note in #3 which was a law that got repealed in some states and stopped from being enacted in others). All the above aside, there are notes about other countries where guns have either been severely regulated (see most Nordic countries) or severely limited/removed altogether (Australia, New Zealand, England, etc.) yet I don’t see any of those countries dropping into anarchy or totalitarian regimes. In truth, it looks like those countries where the guns flow freely tend to skew more towards anarchy (just take a look right here in the good ‘ol US of A), especially when guns and religion are mixed."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"Best freelancing sites are: 1.

Leasing is a fantastic option, but is not for everyone. Leasing a car is the most flexible way to buy a car. Let’s dig in. When you lease a car, it presents three options you would not have if you were going to lock yourself into a 60 or 72 month loan purchasing a vehicle. At the end of the lease you have the option to turn it in, and walk away. This is great if you are the type of person who gets tired of vehicles before the loan is satisfied, or you are not sure what your future looks like. Let me be more specific, let’s say you want this nice fancy coop but are not sure if you will be having a baby in the near future or your needs will change in someway. This is good because if you were to get involved with a 60 or 72 month loan, if three years later you hate the car or are tired of it, you would be very much upside down on this loan and have a hard time trading it without negative equity. Leasing eliminates this. The second major point is, if you continually lease a vehicle you will always have a vehicle with the newest technology in it, and always have a vehicle under warranty. Although you will always have a payment, you will never be responsible for major repairs. The third point is, if you are after a payment, you will be able to lease a vehicle significantly less monthly than a loan on the vehicle. In most cases with minimal cash down, you will be in a lease for the same money monthly that you would be with substantially more money down in a 60 month loan. I would say those are some pretty good pros to leasing, but there are definitely cons, and leasing is definitely not for everyone. Let’s take a look at why. If you are unsure of how many miles per year you drive or are not confident in safely overestimating how many miles leasing could be very bad for you if you go over miles substantially. If you were the person that tends to keep their vehicle for a very long time and have the intention of leasing the vehicle but in the back your head me know deep down you will most likely buy out the lease, it is almost never advantageous to do this because you’ll in most cases be able to find a used car identical to yours with lower miles perhaps even a year newer and with more equipment for what the residual or buy out on your lease is."},{"prompt":"Would you ever wear a Rolex submariner with a suit and/or blazer?","completion":"Funny question as this is exactly what Rolex did to promote the Submariner! Have a look at this vintage ad below : On my side, I would add that the coolest thing with the Submariner is precisely its versatility. You can literally wear it on any occasion. T shirt, jeans, blazer, suit, under the shower, while diving, naked! It will always work! There are so little watches where this is actually true and its one of the reasons why this watch is considered as an icon. Personally, I like to break the formal look of a suit with a sportier watch and play on that contrast. This works pretty well, especially when you are quite young. Hey you know what?

Pretty messed up age. What all I am going to share is not just for a 17 year old girl but every girl irrespective of the age and maturity. Don’t compare yourself and don’t let others compare you. We have the tendency to look beautiful and compare ourselves with some celebs. I ask you why? Everyone’s life and situation is different. They are getting paid for being beautiful. If you leave your studies and the job you are doing and have lots of money, trust me you might look better than them. But you can’t! You have responsibilities to carry. Accept yourself the way you are to avoid that mental stress. Don’t feel insecure about looks. While I shared a picture of mine in an ethnic wear, I mentioned I am dusky, average looking girl and too photogenic and the picture I am sharing is filtered. A girl messaged thanking me for making me accept herself completely. So what if I am dusky? So what if I am short. Big deal? I need the world to know I am dusky and average looking. Why? Because my beauty lies in the confidence I carry, the smile I wear, the kind heart I have, the attitude of not giving up I pursue, and the aspirations I hold. It makes me beautiful. People will come and go, judge you with your clothes and look, but the one who will love you, will love you even when you lose all your teeth and your memory in old age! Remember that. Just try to change your flaws and try being nice. DON’T body-shame any girl/guy EVER! People mostly say that a girl is jealous of another girl and to some extent it’s true. Most of us try to portray a good image in front of men by portraying other girls bad and mean and by trolling their looks. This should be a big NO! Never be jealous of any girl. Also never demean any girl. There are people whom I know of have the tendency not to compliment girls. Change it! Trolling friends by addressing them with cute names as “Moti” and “Patli” is okay till it’s fun and should not be exaggerated. Don’t run behind trying to find a right guy. Take your time. Things happen automatically. No one knows the future. Be someone who understands what life is all about and certainly it’s not always about the “Guy”. Be ambitious. Be cautious. Be fierce and be simple. A girl with ambitions and trying to achieve one is the sexiest! Don’t ever get intimate with someone you don’t love/ Someone who doesn’t feel for you if you are emotional People wanted me to hook up casually after my break up. I knew it would destroy me since I am a very emotional person who believes in love. Being vulnerable makes you do stupid things which you will always regret later. Try to stay away from things that might hurt you in future. Don’t trust anyone who suddenly becomes close to you after your breakup because you never know your weakness. Don’t think it’s too late for you to pursue a different career Girls have the tendency to think that it’s time to marry else they won’t get any eligible groom after 25. They even continue with that career they are not interested because who has time to switch? Nope! Please do it. Situations might not have allowed you to pursue something you wanted but there is always a time you can go for it. Even I am doing PhD for the sake of stability. Marriage can wait, the right groom can wait but not your dreams. Don’t betray men! Or don’t let the man betray you. Falling in love is easy but maintaining that love comes from within. If someone loves you, love them back with the same passion if you are in a relationship. If you feel like the luster is lost, it’s better to let go of the relationship by mutual consent and talks. But yes, don’t dump or ditch a person without any explanation! Everyone deserves an explanation. It makes one go mad thinking about the reason of being dumped. Be true to your relationship or never be in one! Also, the day you realize you are being cheated, let go of that toxic relationship and feel happy about it. P.S: Remember, if you are good, a lot many generations can be great. :) :) -Smita"},{"prompt":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","completion":"Well, buckle up because I've got some [LINKED_TEXT: mind-blowing] [URL: http://alphamindset.brizy.site/] facts that'll leave you speechless!

Incorporating these keywords naturally in the page's title, headings, content, meta descriptions, and URLs.Quality Content: Creating high-quality, informative, and valuable content that addresses the needs of the target audience. Ensuring the content is well-structured with appropriate headings and subheadings.Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: Writing compelling and relevant title tags and meta descriptions that accurately represent the content of the page.

Including relevant keywords in these header tags.URL Structure: Creating clear and descriptive URLs that reflect the content of the page. Avoiding long, complex URLs with unnecessary parameters.Internal Linking: Linking to other relevant pages within your website to provide context and improve navigation. Using descriptive anchor text for internal links.Image Optimization: Optimizing images by using descriptive filenames and alt text to help search engines understand the content of the images.Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensuring that the web page is responsive and displays well on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.Page Speed and Load Time: Optimizing the page's loading speed by minimizing code, using compressed images, and leveraging browser caching.Schema Markup: Implementing schema markup (structured data) to provide additional context to search engines about the content, such as reviews, events, products, and more.User Experience (UX):Creating a positive user experience with easy navigation, readable fonts, and a clean design. Reducing bounce rates by delivering relevant and engaging content.Canonical Tags: Using canonical tags to indicate the preferred version of a page if there are multiple versions with similar content.Optimized URLs and Permalinks: Using short, descriptive, and keyword-rich URLs that are easy to read and share. On-page SEO is a foundational aspect of search engine optimization and plays a crucial role in helping search engines understand your content and rank it appropriately. When combined with off-page SEO (external factors like backlinks and social signals) and technical SEO (site structure, indexing, etc.), on-page SEO contributes to improving your website's overall search engine visibility and organic traffic. Certainly, here are a few more advanced concepts and techniques related to on-page SEO: Keyword Variations and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI):Beyond using exact-match keywords, incorporating related keyword variations and LSI keywords can enhance the content's relevancy and appeal to both search engines and users.Content Length and Depth: IN some cases, longer and more comprehensive content can rank better. Creating in-depth, authoritative content can attract backlinks and establish your website as an authoritative source.Content Optimization: Optimizing content not just for search engines but for users too. Balancing keyword usage with natural language is crucial to maintaining readability and engagement.User Intent Optimization: Understanding the intent behind users' search queries and tailoring your content to match that intent. This can involve creating content that educates, entertains, or solves problems.Page Categorization and Taxonomies: Organizing your content into categories and creating well-defined taxonomies can help search engines understand the structure of your website and improve user navigation.Multimedia Integration: Incorporating multimedia elements like videos, infographics, and interactive content can enhance user engagement and encourage longer page visits.Structured Data and Rich Snippets: Implementing structured data markup can provide search engines with more detailed information about your content, potentially leading to rich snippets in search results.Optimizing for Featured Snippets: Crafting content that directly answers common questions can increase the likelihood of your content being featured in Google's \\"Featured Snippets\\" at the top of search results.Incorporating Social Signals: While the direct impact of social signals on SEO is debated, a strong social presence can lead to increased content sharing and potential exposure to a wider audience.Regular Content Updates: Keeping your content fresh and up-to-date can signal to search engines that your site is actively maintained and relevant.A/B Testing and Conversion Rate Optimization: Optimizing not only for search engines but also for user actions. Testing different calls to action, layouts, and designs can improve your site's conversion rates.Localized On-Page Sealift you have a local business, optimizing your pages for local search terms and including location-specific information can help attract local customers.Avoiding Duplicate Content: Ensuring that your content is unique and not duplicated across different pages on your site or across different websites.Security and HTTPS: Using HTTPS encryption can boost your site's trustworthiness and have a positive impact on search rankings.Monitoring and Analytics: Regularly tracking your site's performance using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help you identify areas for improvement and track the impact of your on-page SEO efforts. Remember that the world of SEO is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices to ensure your on-page SEO efforts remain effective. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategies based on changes in search engine algorithms and user behavior is key to maintaining and improving your search rankings and organic traffic.

Let’s try one interpretation. For definiteness, let’s imagine we are trying to compress a black and white picture which we’ll put up as a bunch of pixels/cells on our Game of Life board. How would we “use the game of life” to compress that picture? Well, we want to end up with either exactly that picture (lossless compression) or something close (lossy compression). We start with a blank array of pixels/cells and somehow “supply” the compressed value to it. Since the Life rules are set, all we can supply is instructions to set or clear any cell. We could either set up the initial values immediately, or we could do something more sequential, where we put down some set of initial cells, let Life run for some number of steps, then put down more cells, and so on. Now, clearly we could simply put down the exact picture and not run Life at all. That “works” but doesn’t do any compression. Or we could do the same thing but put down a JPEG compression of the image. That compresses but rather misses the point of the question. It would be nice if we could find some precursor state of the picture which is significantly smaller than the picture itself, but will evolve to it (or to some good approximation of it) over time. We could do a brute force search - start with the picture, consider every possible predecessor state, then for each of those every possible predecessor state, and so on. Keep going until either (a) there is no possible predecessor state, in which case we lose; or (b) we find a predecessor which is significantly smaller than what we started with, in which case we win. How often we get stuck due to (a) - and whether we can fix that by throwing away some details of the original, i.e., making the compression lossy - isn’t clear - but I’d guess it happens fairly often. Now, this is one plausible interpretation of “using the Game of Life.” Since the Game of Life is Turing-universal, we could instead use it to simulate a Turing machine and then run on it any compression algorithm we like. Done. That’s the problem with looking for solutions “using” some technique: It’s not a well-defined concept. I’m guessing this question was inspired by old ideas of using fractals for compression. Since simple fractal formulas can produce extremely detailed, highly complex, sets, it seems “obvious” to start with a detailed, highly complex set - like a photograph - and “work backwards” to a short formula that will evolve into it. There were tons of claims of success in doing this, but I haven’t heard much about this in years. The problem is that “work backwards” step doesn’t seem to generalize in any useful way.

Palmyra Tender Nut. More commonly known as Palm fruit, or “நுங்கு” in Tamizh, it is the fruit from the palm tree. Every fruit normally contains three pods inside its shell. The pods inside are filled with juice on the inside, much like coconut and its water. And the tricky thing is, you’ve got to peel the white outer layer to taste the bliss within. Sure, there are a few gods I know who can swallow it whole, but I prefer it without the outer skin, as the bitterness obscures most of the taste. The peeled skin can be put to other uses, too. It makes a great face mask. But time is of the essence during this process. The more time the fruit remains outside, the harder it becomes, and it is useless to eat the fruit if it has lost all its slippery softness. The contributor to the most amount of mess is the water inside the fruit. I’ve never succeeded in drinking the water without spilling. It tastes sweet, but the struggle undergone to acquire it often makes me wonder if it is worth it. Coming to the “civilized” part, I don’t think anyone looks terribly dignified while slurping the water out of the fruit or peeling it without making themselves sticky all over. And I know I look like a kindergartner who’s been force-fed his lunch by his grumpy mum by the time I finish eating three fruits. Nandri!"},{"prompt":"ello!

I remember cowering at him yelling at me in the barn with his voice bellowing in my ears. He loved us, abs we him, but was a former drill instructor from South Louisiana now working working midnight shifts at the Great Southern Lumber Company Paper Mill. Everyone respected but was terrified of him. My father always showed him an insurmountable level of respect, as did we all. We all watched my dad and followed his lead. Papa would speak, we would listen, then do as instructed, and God help us if we made noise during the day to wake him. If myself or my older brother heard the floors creek in the back, we would be out the door running. One day after church, I must've been 8 or 9, I wasjumping around making noise and knocked the shelf full of the Encyclopedia of Britannica collection to the ground. My granddaughter busted through the front door yelling at me for being loud and breaking the shelf. He lurched across the room, grabbed me and threw me over his knee to spank me. From out of nowhere it seemed, my soft spoken father appeared, he grabbed my Papa by the arm, then pulled me to my mother with his other, and told him if he ever laid a hand on me again that he would regret it and never see us kids again. I never saw him raise his voice or his hand before or after this, nor my grandfather for that matter.

The hydrant was blue and I thought it was a paranoid homeowner who installed a private fire hydrant for his own use. There were no red lines or signs saying no parking.","completion":"Not parking within a certain distance of a hydrant is statutory in most places. (It’s written laws and no signs or lines have to be there.) Let’s say the law where you are is 15 feet, and you parked 14 feet, 9 inches from the hydrant, you could plead guilty (you were) with an explanation - that you don’t normally carry a tape measure with you, and it looked to be at least 15 feet when you parked. That might reduce the fine, or even get it suspended. (3 inches isn’t going to make much difference to the firefighters hooking up to the hydrant. But if you parked right in front of it? I’d still plead guilty with an explanation, and just say that you weren’t aware that hydrants could be any color but red (or yellow, or whatever is common there), so you thought it was some homeowner trying to guarantee himself a parking space - and you’ve been educated now. You’ll still pay, but the judge might lessen the fine a bit. But don’t try to plead not guilty if you were within 5 feet or so of the hydrant. If you can’t tell the difference between even 10 feet and 15 feet you shouldn’t be driving. And if you’re guilty beyond any doubt (which you would be if you were within a few feet of it), nothing you say can make you not guilty. (The only case I’ve ever seen of someone “beating” a fire hydrant ticket was one in which a cardiac surgeon saw a man dropping from a serious coronary infarction while he was passing the scene. [He was a cardiac surgeon - he knew the difference between “he’s having chest pains” and “he’s about to die” even at 10 feet.] He started to perform external cardiac massage [and went further - I won’t get gory], and kept it up in the ambulance that eventually got the victim to the hospital. Oops - when he stopped, it was about 2 feet from a hydrant. He came back later to find a summons on the car. He pled guilty with an explanation. [He was guilty.] The judge dismissed the charge and apologized, on behalf of the city, for having wasted the doctor’s time. So unless you were performing external cardiac massage …)"},{"prompt":"What is today's best trend on Twitter on 10 September 2020?","completion":"How can someone so toxic towars Hinduism Rahul Khan is completely exposed Har Har Mahadev 🙏 Happy Ganesh chaturthi 😀"},{"prompt":"Who are some of the greatest geniuses in physics from MIT?","completion":"Many brilliant physicists have studied or worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Most cup and core bullets are formed from flat copper cookies punched out of flat ribbons. They look like featureless pennies. They go through a series of punches to form cups that lead alloy pellets are pressed into. They then go through several other dies that create the point. Its very difficult to make a die with a sharply tapered precisely pointed hole to form a tip. To get a sharp point either requires a bullet to be machined or a special tip inserted and bonded to to the front of the bullet. Machining tiny sharp points is somewhat difficult because as you get to the sharper portion the material is thinner and tends to ride up onto the cutting tool. This requires that cuts be made in small increments which means time consuming. Time is money in any manufacturing. Lead cannot be formed into sharp points because its too soft. Another factor is how bullets are stabilized. When you take a long sharp point you change the center of gravity and it can cause yaw from its center axis. In an exaggerated sense picture throwing a baseball bat while holding the large end. The bat will want to wobble and flip. On the other hand throw a football. The football is more stable in flight. There has to be a balance. A new bullet recently introduced is the Hornady A-tip. It is very long and and sleek and fairly pointed. They get away with this design because a good portion of the front is aluminum. The tips are much lighter than the material farther back so it has a well balanced center of gravity. The point helps with its aerodynamic drag. They are very expensive. Usually around a dollar per projectile. The last factor I'll throw out is that narrow tips take a beating in the loading process going from magazine to chamber. Soft, narrow tips are easily bent traveling up and into a chamber. Semi-auto and automatic firearm loading is generally considered a violent mechanical manuever. Ive broken lots of tips off bullets with plastic type tips."},{"prompt":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","completion":"How long were in it that coma ?"},{"prompt":"Which countries were Portuguese colonies?","completion":"Seasonal work & Employment Portugal Embassy VFS Appointment Available Contact +917740076607"},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"A blind man sitting unattended in the middle of a packed ward in his own feces."},{"prompt":"Do many Americans want to decide the Presidency directly, rather than by using the electoral college? I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","completion":"Yes, I believe so. Before last year, I think relatively few Americans were even really aware of the electoral college. Even so, enough people are convinced that states representing 165 electors (of the 270 required for a majority) have already signed onto a compact obligating them to essentially move to a popular vote once 270 electors sign on: [LINKED_TEXT: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact] Even more so than most countries, rural parts of the US are at war with the urban. Have been since the civil war, but it’s intensified since Lee Atwater decided to corner the political market on southerners and make a party which explicitly caters to rural areas and racial grudges, something he freely admitted he was doing. And I’m only slightly exaggerating when I say war, since it has actually come to that in the past, and during the civil rights movement Northern civilians were attacked by police and State militias representing a particular point of view. And this is a mechanism placed into our constitution by an unfortunate compromise made with the slave trade. Don’t believe it? Look at the two items in the constitution that are not subject to amendment: slavery and the overrepresentation of Small (primarily slave) states in Congress. Add in the 3/5 compromise, essentially assigning yet more overrepresentation to southerners, and you might thInk the pro-electoral-college arguments are just a smokescreen that’s been going for 240 years. Now, inevitably, someone is going to bring up that the founders never intended a popular vote. Which is true, but irrelevant. They are long gone, and it’s a very different nation now. I’m pretty confident that they would be far more outraged by our political parties (which they were adamantly opposed to) and the quality of people in office, than by proposals to get rid of the “small state” advantages, which many of them saw as an odious compromise— or a good one, if they were from a small state. If the founding fathers were here today, they might propose something very much like superdelegates (but across party lines, since there would be no parties), chosen from state legislators, governors and prominent people — who would get together in a room and pick a President with no public involvement. Like I said, it’s a different country today. And sure, people are extra outraged when an election goes so strongly against the popular vote — for the second time, since Al Gore won the popular vote by half a million votes while losing the EC, and now, Hillary won by 3M and lost the EC. And sure, the folks who got the short end of the stick are the most exercised about it. Nothing wrong with that. Not trying to relitigate the election, but I do wish we could fix this for the future. Between this and the gerrymandered house— where Democrats are also consistently winning the popular vote while winding up with a minority of seats— and one person, one vote looks like a bad joke— it’s more like 1 Wyoming person, 4 votes. And as the nation further urbanizes and further concentrates into the big states, New Yorkers, Californians, and Texans will screwed over more and more each year until it gets fixed.

Apple has stated that the Mac's traditional input methods, such as the keyboard and trackpad, are more efficient and precise than touch screens for tasks such as typing, selecting text, and navigating menus. Another reason why Macs don't have touch screens is because the macOS operating system is not optimized for touch input. Unlike iOS, which is designed specifically for touch screens, macOS is designed for use with a keyboard and mouse or trackpad. Adding touch screen support to macOS would require significant changes to the operating system, which could potentially compromise its stability and performance. Finally, Apple may also be hesitant to add touch screens to Macs because it could cannibalize sales of its iPad and iPhone devices, which are designed specifically for touch input. By keeping touch screens exclusive to its mobile devices, Apple is able to maintain a clear distinction between its desktop and mobile product lines."},{"prompt":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","completion":"I'd ask him if Peter Thiel keeps his A.I. “consciousness” on servers at Quora, or at his fortress in New Zealand, or does he use Facebook's?

Therefore, to support the weight bigger landing gear was installed near the front. The nose of planes was also generally quite near the wing, so instead of placing a landing gear at the nose, landing gear was placed at the rear, which usually only held the rudder and elevators. However, in a modern-day propeller plane, the centre of gravity is usually placed at the front of the plane, therefore the alignment of landing gear we use today."},{"prompt":"Who is the most powerful Marvel character in MCU?","completion":"Who are among the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe?

Review: ‘Dil Bechara’ is the Hindi film adaptation of John Green’s popular 2012 novel, 'The Fault in Our Stars'. In fact, the book’s Hollywood adaptation with the same name in 2016 met with much critical acclaim. ‘Dil Bechara’ sets itself in Jamshedpur and introduces us to the Basu family. Kizie Basu (Sanjana Sanghi) suffers from thyroid cancer, which has now affected her lungs, requiring her to be on oxygen support almost all the time. With rock solid support from her parents, Kizie takes life as it comes, even taking the bleak, daily multiple hospital visits in her stride. But what she craves for, is a normal life like any girl her age – with regular problems like boyfriends, crushes et al. Instead what she ends up doing is attend funerals of people she doesn't know, to feel a connection of the inevitable that lies ahead of her. She meets Immanuel Rajkumar Junior or Manny (Sushant Singh Rajput) in college at first and later at a cancer support group. And given her quiet, introvert nature, at first, she is wary of his high energy, exuberance and cockiness. Manny has his own story – he has survived osteosarcoma and his cancer is currently in remission. The two strike up a beautiful bond as a smitten Manny manages to wriggle his way into her heart, despite Kizie trying hard to avert a heartbreak for him, eventually. Their cutesy chemistry grows on you as they zip through the lanes of Jamshedpur in his scooter. And also as they shoot a Bhojpuri film together for Manny's close friend, Jagdish Pandey (Sahil Vaid), whose dream is to direct a film before losing his eyesight to cancer. When Manny decides to go all out to fulfill Kizie’s long standing wish of meeting her favourite musician, Abhimanyu Vaid (Saif Ali Khan), she realises she has fallen for him, too. But little does she know that a tragic twist in the tale awaits her. Given its poignant premise, ‘Dil Bechara’ makes for a very emotional watch. Even as the story’s underlying message, of celebrating life despite knowing the inevitable, injects it with an infectious energy. Especially in the form of Manny’s character who wants to literally grab every moment of the day. Sushant Singh Rajput, navigating the depth of his character, shines with a stellar performance that is sensitive, intense, lively and vulnerable. It is with a heavy heart that one watches him effortlessly get under the skin of his character and exude a natural charm. With this, the fine actor adds to his legacy of commendable work in a short span of time. And watch out for his brilliant moves in the one-shot title track, choreographed by Farah Khan. Sanjana Sanghi who makes her debut in a leading role gives an assured, confident performance. The supporting cast, especially Swastika Mukherjee and Saswata Chatterjee as Kizie's parents are superb and Saif Ali Khan in a cameo is noteworthy. The soundtrack (composed by A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya) is peppered with some fantastic, foot-tapping music – particularly Khulke Jeene Ka, Taare Ginn and the title track, Dil Bechara. The chemistry between the lead pair is refreshing to watch, especially in the beautifully shot (cinematography by Satyajit Pande) sequences in Paris. Director Mukesh Chhabra and writers Suprotim Sengupta and Shashank Khaitan ensure the narrative flows, taking you through some tender, touching moments between Kizie and Manny and Kizie and her parents. And be prepared for some heartbreaking scenes and dialogues that will definitely bring you to tears. Even though the film’s spirit and breezy pace triumphs, the melancholy that augurs it, will leave you in a puddle of emotions and with a heavy lump in your throat as the end credits roll. ‘Dil Bechara’ will always be remembered as Sushant Singh Rajput’s swan song. Watch this movie simply to witness Sushant Singh Rajput’s last act. A brilliant one at that."},{"prompt":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","completion":"There are many websites where you can find cheap flight tickets.

Somehow, they’ve done the impossible, making everyone hate it. I think this is one of the few times that fanatics in both Comicsgate and SJW’s despise something (though for very different reasons). For Comicsgaters and people that care about left-wing politics (in particular identity politics), this is the perfect example of what they believe is wrong with comic books these days. Left-wing politics that create shallow characters that are simply there to fulfil an agenda and tick the boxes in ‘how to be Woke’. POC (check), Non-binary (check), breaking stereotypes by having a plus-sized hero (check). Seriously, with characters like ‘Snowflake’ and ‘Safe-space’, Marvel is essentially making the argument for Comicsgate. For SJWs and those that believe diversity should be more prevalent in comic books, these characters come off more as mocking and joke characters. ‘Snowflake’, I believe, is supposed to be non-binary yet they make them look like a freak. I know it’s comics but it’s still pretty stupid to seemingly drive the narrative that all those that aren’t hetero-normative are somehow weird and look weird. People in those communities already have issues of their own and Marvel, in their quest to be ‘Woke’, did the exact opposite of ‘representation’ and made a joke of a character. Then There’s This Guy: Personally, I think it’s BRILLIANT how tone-deaf Marvel is. ‘Screentime’ apparently gets his powers from ‘experimental internet gas’. How quirky and ecCENtric. I can just imagine how funny the writers thought they were being and how ‘IN’ they would be with the ‘kids’. They must’ve thought, “People these days care about movements and diversity! It’ll totally be a hit with the younger generation!”, without understanding their readers, the current culture and the new generation at all. These writers probably never understood that we’re in the era of cringe. Regardless of leaning left or right, our new generation loves to stand by and cringe at how stupid people can be (especially past generations especially when they try to appeal to the kids by being ‘cool’). This time they’ve truly gifted everyone on the internet something to laugh at in these trying time. (Thank You, Marvel!) Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!

Here are a few commonly discussed drawbacks: High initial costs: Developing and implementing robots can involve significant upfront costs, including research and development, acquisition of hardware and software, and training. This cost factor may limit access to robotic technologies for smaller organizations or individuals.Limited flexibility and adaptability: While robots excel at performing specific programmed tasks, they may struggle with tasks that require complex decision-making, adaptability to dynamic environments, or fine motor skills. Robots are often less versatile compared to humans in handling unpredictable or novel situations.Job displacement and socioeconomic impact: The automation of certain tasks through robots can lead to job displacement for human workers. This can have socio-economic consequences, such as unemployment or the need for reskilling and job transition for affected individuals. Ensuring a smooth transition and addressing potential inequalities arising from automation is a significant challenge.Ethical considerations: As robots become more capable, ethical concerns arise regarding their decision-making, accountability, and potential impact on society. Questions about robot rights, safety, privacy, and the potential for bias or discrimination in AI systems require careful consideration and regulation.Maintenance and technical challenges: Robots require ongoing maintenance, regular software updates, and skilled technicians for repairs. Managing and troubleshooting complex robotic systems can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and resources.Dependence on technology: Relying heavily on robots can make systems vulnerable to technological failures, cyberattacks, or disruptions. A loss of connectivity, power outage, or system malfunction could temporarily halt operations and necessitate alternative plans or redundancies. It's important to note that these disadvantages are not inherent to all robots or robotic systems. Advancements in technology, continued research, and appropriate planning and regulations can help mitigate many of these challenges. Additionally, the benefits and advantages offered by robots, such as increased productivity, efficiency, and safety in certain applications, often outweigh these drawbacks, leading to their continued development and adoption in various industries."},{"prompt":"w did you end up in the San Francisco Bay Area? What's your story?","completion":"In the late 1980’s, I was working as a high school librarian in Iowa. I lived in a large apartment complex with my two kids. I was casually aquatinted with another male teacher (different school) in the complex because our kids would be at the complex swimming pool together. I once had dinner at his home with a group of other people. We were both politically active in the gay community. He was tragically murdered by a young man he picked up (a trick, on other words). The police found my name on a list in his apartment. It may have been a list of contacts for the political gay rights group we belonged to. The cops decided it was some sort of “sex ring” to use their term. (You have to recall that Iowa is about 50 years behind the times). The cops went to my boss and i was fired for “associating with known homosexuals.”. I sued. That pretty much killed my chance of ever working in the state again. I cleaned corporate apartments to support my kids. After a few months, i settled the kids with their mother, sold everything i owned, and drove to San Francisco (Seattle was plan B). I had a good job prospect in a few weeks. I carefully screened my references. However, one of them hinted at problems but refused to say more. The prospective boss called me and ask what that was about. I told her i was fired for being gay. She said: “I thought so. I want to offer you a job. Welcome to California”. A few weeks later i say her at the Pride Parade. Turned out she was a lesbian. I held that job for 29 years. I got regular promotions. Earned an additional degree. Brought my kids to SF.

There is also a third archangel, Rafael, whose name means \\"God has healed\\". This means that you turn to Michael with problems that are extreme or next to “impossible”, and especially for protection (he is the guy with the sword, remember). To Gabriel you turn when you need help with problems related to education, work, income, etc., (his lantern and scroll, for instance, are clues to his areas of specialisation). And you turn to Rafael with problems regarding health and the heart (he is often depicted holding a potion flask, and in the Bible you can find him as a healer).

When to avail the BLANK PAPER TICKET? Suppose you have to travel between Mathura and Ballia ( I am taking these two cities as example as i used to travel between these two when i was in my college , my home town is Ballia and my college was in Mathura). There wasn't any direct train between these two stations , if i had to travel to Ballia from mathura then i would come to Allahabad or Varanasi from one direct train and then to ballia in other train. in other train's case after deboarding the first train i would go to railway ticket counter , would take general ticket for ballia and would wait for next train to Ballia.(You can take reservation in other train between Varanasi and ballia but it's only 140kms and most trains don't allow reservation for such less distance ). This whole complexity used to make my journey very inconvenient and arduous. Let's come to the topic PAPER BLANK TICKET - It was the solution which made my whole journey very easy. This ticket allows you to cover your whole journey in a single ticket. For availing this type of ticket you have to do nothing but simply go the railway reservation counter and give your journey details in the reservation form, write above the reservation form \\"PAPER BLANK TICKET\\" and fill all your details. let's take this simple example again - Your journey is in between Mathura and Ballia.A Direct train is available between Mathura and Varanasi.An indirect train which comes from some other route ( suppose from Mumbai to Ballia) is available from Varanasi for Ballia. Now given the above scenerio , in BLANK PAPER TICKET your reservation will be booked between Mathura and Ballia , but a seat will be alloted between Mathura and Varanasi only because a direct train is available in this route and that's why a seat will be alloted in this route only. From Varanasi you can travel in any train's reserved coach but a seat will not be alloted to you in that particular train , you will have the right to enter the reserved coach of that particular train and reach your destination but no any specific seat will be alloted to you. you can sit at any seat by requesting any fellow passenger. You can see in the attached image how to fill the reservation form or you can ask at the counter about filling of form. The only con of this system is that you will have to book your ticket on railway counters only. it can't be booked online."},{"prompt":"w much would it cost to crowdfund a mission using SpaceX to catch up and explore Oumuamua?","completion":"It’s not possible, cost is not the issue."},{"prompt":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

You noticed him and his warning, so stopping you wasn’t as high a priority. If he had been going the same direction as you and had nothing more important going on, he would have pulled you over.

Some Sony Xperia models can even play high-resolution audio files (up to 24bit/192Khz). But simply connecting headphones (regardless of whatever their “hi-fi”- credentials) directly to your phone won’t reveal all the nuances of even ‘standard’ 16/44.1 FLAC audio files. The limiting factor is the phone’s built-in DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and amplifier. Since physical space and battery life are at such a premium when designing a phone, manufacturers are forced to compromise in their choice of DAC and amp silicon. Most of the time this isn’t an issue - most end-users will be happy with the sound coming out of their phone/standard earbuds when playing compressed MP3s or streaming audio. Move on up to lossless or HD audio, and most devices will be found wanting. To get the best possible quality out of 16bit/44.1Khz (or higher) FLAC files on a phone you need to be able to output the untouched digital signal, then send it to a DAC and amp. Most Android phones sold today support direct digital audio output (i.e. bypassing the internal DAC and amp) usually by using what’s called a USB OTG cable. Note that any old mobile phone USB cable doesn’t necessarily support USB OTG - you’ll need to check. Then it’s a question of adding a mobile DAC/amp, and connecting that to your headphones/earbuds. Some names to look out for in the mobile DAC/amp world are FiiO, iFi, Chord, AudioLab, Audioquest, or RHA. Of course it goes without saying that you need to be using high-quality headphones or earbuds, that connect via a cable. Using any wireless Bluetooth device won’t give you as good a result, even from devices that use the latest [LINKED_TEXT: aptX-HD] [URL: https://www.soundguys.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-aptx-and-aptx-hd-19914/] or [LINKED_TEXT: LDAC] [URL: https://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-guide-20026/] codecs.

As a woman boarded the Mumbai-Bengaluru Udyan Express at Gulbarga, Karnataka, she noticed that the compartment was jam packed and with great difficulty she managed to find a seat. The ticket inspector or TC came and started checking people’s tickets. He turned towards her and asked her about the ticket. She replied “I have already shown you my ticket.” The TC said “Not you madam, the girl hiding below your berth.” It was when the woman observed that a young girl about 13–14 years old was hiding below her berth. When the TC yelled at her, the girl came out of hiding and she looked very scared and it appeared as though she had been crying previously. The TC tried to forcibly pull her away from the compartment when the woman intervened. She said “I will pay for her ticket”. The TC was surprised and the woman paid for that girl’s ticket and the TC left the compartment. Then the woman and the girl started talking. It was when the woman realised that the girl’s name was Chitra who lived in a village near Bidar district of Karnataka. Her father was a coolie and she had lost her mother long back. Her father had remarried and her stepmother ill-treated her. Now even her father had died and out of fear, Chitra had escaped. By the time the train reached Bengaluru, the woman got down from the train and saw Chitra’s sad face. The woman again took pity on Chitra and took her to her friend’s place. Her friend managed shelter homes for boys and girls, which were supported by the woman’s organisation. Chitra now had a new direction in her life. The woman frequently talked with Chitra and enquired about her well being. Chitra was a bright student and this woman wanted to sponsor her college studies. But Chitra politely said that she wanted to do a diploma in Computer Science so that she could immediately get a job. She completed her diploma successfully and obtained a job in a software company. With her first salary, she bought a new saree and a box of sweets to the woman who had guided her. Chitra then got the opportunity to fly to the US from her company. She called this woman, took her blessings and flew to the US. The two always kept in touch via email. After a few years, the woman went to San Francisco to attend a Kannada Koota meet which was organised by Kannadiga families living in California. She was staying in the same hotel where the meet was taking place. After the meet, when the woman was about to checkout from the hotel, the hotel staff told her that her bill had already been paid and pointed out to the person who had paid the bill. The woman then saw a lady with a young man who was her husband. This lady was none other than Chitra and both the ladies were filled with joy on seeing each other after a long time. Chitra touched the woman’s feet and took her blessings. The woman now asked Chitra “Why did you pay for my hotel bill Chitra?”. Chitra was overwhelmed with tears, hugged the woman and told her “Because you paid for my ticket from Mumbai to Bengaluru!” This woman has helped a number of Chitras come up in life. Many such Chitras have found a new direction in life courtesy this woman who is an inspiration to every Indian. This woman is a philanthropist and her social work covers healthcare, education, empowerment of women, public hygiene, art and culture, and poverty alleviation at the grassroots level. Her vision of a library for each school has resulted in the setting up of 50,000 libraries so far across India. She is helping out rural areas by building 10,000 public toilets and improving the sanitation. Through the chairperson of the organisation, she has helped in the rehabilitation of areas affected by natural calamities and she is a prolific writer in Kannada and English. Her husband is also very famous but it is the lady who undoubtedly is big hearted. She is very simple and down to earth despite her unmatched fame. This woman who has helped thousands of Chitras get a new life is none other than Mrs. Sudha Murthy, the Chairperson of the Infosys Foundation."},{"prompt":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","completion":"I’d like to know what the world would be like today if there had been no Hitler. No World War II. No fear of a Nazi revolution any time anybody says something rude about another group of people. No national fortunes plunged into buying a war machine. Just before World War I most of Europe and most of the world was enjoying a particular time of relaxation which brought about an explosion in the arts. By the end of the twentieth century fighting two world wars almost wiped out the economies of many formerly prosperous nations. Our economic and social landscape would look very different today. Ironically though, the alternative may be worse. The devastation of World War II may be what been holding us back from a far more serious world war with more recent modern weapons. Then again, if there had been no WWII, then the Americans might not have felt such an urge to develop nuclear weapons. The idea of a world with no Hitler raises many interesting questions."},{"prompt":"w do you deliver effective communication?","completion":"In a quiet place, with a gentle tone, and with compassion.

Each department has its own pros and cons. Lets compare Indian Railway and Central Water Commission. PAY Scale - In both the department officers are recruited at basic pay of 56100 and Pay scale of 56100-177500 (Level 10, Group A officers)Place of Posting - If you want to live in a metro city then Central water commission is a right choice. In indian railway there are very few chances that you will live in a metro city and if you get chance then it will be for a very shorter period of time.Work Life Balance - Central water commission is far ahead than indian railway in work life balance.Powers - Central water commission lags behind than indian railway because Water is a State Subject.Transfers - there are frequent transfers in indian railway but same is not the case with central water commissionGrowth - If you are talking in terms of promotion then their is not much difference in Indian Railway and Central water commission. Promotion depends upon multiple things like how many officers are ahead of you in your batch itself and how many officers have been recruited in recent years etc. One more thing, even if you are not promoted, your salary will increase (as per Pay Parity Rule)Perks - Indian railway officers enjoys many perks that central water commission officers does not get. Like - Train pass for you and your dependent family members. But there is one shortcoming of this - Indian railway officers have to travel with Train irrespective of distance while central water commission officers are eligible to travel by flight on official tours. I think it is the time that matters when you are in service.Work - You will hear that there is no work in central water commission. It is completely wrong. I am working in central water commission and believe me there is sufficient work (more than enough). No need to tell about work in Indian Railway :) So you can see both department has their pros and cons. If you want to enjoy a good life with proper work life balance then go with central water commission and if you want to enjoy power and perks then go with indian Railway.

If one twin does the work, it pushes the other to catch up / match up or reconnect, depending on where you both are in the journey. Don’t be fooled by the thought that the spiritual twin is the more advanced one, it is often found that the matrix (runner) twin is more spiritually mature, only not aware of it.

That would solve the whole “What about what the man wants” sided the debate. For example, my partner and I both do not want children. So, it would not be an issue. Partners need to have similar wants, dreams, goals, plans for relationships to work as whole. Family planning needs to be no different.

Written nearly a hundred years ago, he was way ahead of his time and if you read either book and think “I’ve read this idea before somewhere” then that is because these books have massively influenced a LOT of other writers. Last and First Men deals with the entire imagined future history of mankind’s evolution over the next two billion years, whereas in Starmaker he obviously decided to be a bit more ambitious(!) and go for an entire history of the universe. The scope of his imagination was incredible. And he casually throws ideas into the books over just a few lines sometimes that other writers would later develop entire books around. Truly staggering."},{"prompt":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","completion":"To be motivated to wake up early every morning is very difficult. I have tried it many times.

Afghan side was led by the Afghan Durrani Empire, the Afghan Rohillas, the Mughal state of Awadh and the alliance numbered around 1,00,000 soldiers. Imad-ul-Mulk of Delhi, the Maratha ally had promised Agra(the Maratha-controlled Mughal subah captured by the Afghans) to the Jat Suraj Mal for his support but the Marathas insulted Imad and refused to trade Agra. Suraj Mal was also insulted when he jeopardized the alliance for Agra, and this is how Suraj Mal and Imad left the Maratha side. Marathas invited Sikhs but Sikhs had previously, experienced how Marathas treat their allies. Rajput rulers hated Marathas for draining out the Rajput treasuries for the chauth tax and when not paid, then forceful recovery of tax in addition of the huge war expenses. Maratha camp at Panipat was besieged by the Afghan side, the food supply was cut off so the Maratha leaders tried to conclude a peace but the Afghan king was seeking revenge for the Afghan losses of Kunjpura. Revengeful Peshwa at Pune, then called off his remaining forces from Mysore for the next campaign in North India but this time, the Afghan king himself offered a peace. Other Maratha rulers convinced the Peshwa to accept this offer as the Maratha state was already in a bad condition after Panipat."},{"prompt":"Does using nuclear power avoid the release of greenhouse gases?","completion":"mostly, yes"},{"prompt":"Should I eat McDonald's or Burger King?","completion":"No. Absolutely not.

If he’s on your left, you salute with your left. On all current carriers, the Shooter usually works from the “bubble” (Integrated Catapult Control Station) set into the flight deck. The Bubble for the bow cats (1 and 2) is in between the two tracks, and for the waist cats (3 and 4) it’s on the port side, to the left of Cat 4.

In the same way, making him eat vegetables is a humongous task. I tried many ways which worked for sometime and not always. He will tell all reasons as to why he is postponing that work and playing with dinosaurs. One day I tried saying the same thing this way. 'Oh great. you left your plates as is. I will keep it in sink and become the good boy in home’. It worked immediately. He ran to keep those in sink ahead of me. Tried the same for vegetables. Told him that ‘I keep vegetables in your plate just for namesake. Just don't eat it as always so that I can take that as well and become extra healthy.’ He started eating bitter gourd just like that and told me 'See I will only finish. You will not get those vegetablesss’ This trick is still working successfully for a month.

It’s the same argument that allows us to conclude that the earth doesn’t have a second moon, and that there’s no continent called Atlantis."},{"prompt":"Could Data pass the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek?","completion":"The novel “Kobayashi Maru” is really a set of short stories about the test, with a frame of Kirk, Scott, Sulu, and Chekov stranded in a drifting shuttlecraft and telling their tales, in which Chekov fights futilely. Kirk cheats, we know. Scott doesn’t even want command but he identifies a physical device which he can and does use in simulated combat but which didn’t work when it was tried for real… by him. At the same time, he wipes out more simulated Klingons than anyone else managed. The computer just sends in more Klingons. And Sulu tells the KM that he can’t carry out the rescue and won’t try, leading to temporary mutiny on his simulated bridge. I should say that being in a book means it didn’t “happen”. I would expect Data to decide as Sulu did there, that it can’t be done. To recognise this should count as a pass, although it may be asked whether the Academy means to teach cadets not to attempt the impossible. Maybe you are meant to do that only at the point of deciding to break rules, better to break the laws of physics than the Prime Directive. I think someone said that in one film it says that Data won the encounter, which is more like Scott or like Kirk. Novel “The Galactic Whirlpool”, out before “Star Trek II”, included another sneaky test for command-grade insight: you’re in a spacesuit driving a buggy on Earth’s moon. You get bug spots on your suit helmet. What do you do? You are not told this is a test, you just have a mission to drive somewhere. But calling for advice loses points. The spots are actually moon dust in an unusual state, electrically charged or something. Cadet Kirk stops, uses supplies to fit mudguards to the buggy, and drives on. It seems that in real life, a lot of psychology tests and experiments are not testing you at the task you were given to do. Mel Gilden’s novel “Boogeymen” gives Wesley Crusher the no longer practised KM test as an exercise on the Enterprise’s holodeck, with his childhood monster “Boogeymen” as enemy since Worf is his babysitter. Welsey is crushed, then it goes wrong and when they leave the holodeck, the Boogeymen are still pursuing them - it’s one of those fake exit stories. I think one of Jean Lorrah’s Data novels, “Survivors” and “Metamorphosis”, includes an important test for 24th century officers, and for Data. You’re on a holodeck, but your mind was altered to think it’s real. You’re on a mission gone bad on a planet that hasn’t contacted aliens, except for you being there secretly. Your team are captured and in danger and you have to decide whether to take action that could violate the Prime Directive. In fact, the correct conclusion is that you do not have enough information to decide."},{"prompt":"Why is Jimi Hendrix considered to be so influential on guitar?","completion":"There are several reasons why Hendrix is one the most influential guitarists of popular music. He redefined the electric guitar approach and sound during his generation. And to add, he was an exceptional guitarist and very creative songwriter. His style was blues, soul, r&b based but rock and jazz was also added to round out his overall style. Hendrix played with a lot of bands & musicians before going to England in 1966. And going to England with Chas Chandler was sort of a godsend for him. That put him in the company of the popular British music echelons of musicians and performers. He was given the chance to expand and blossom musically with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The ‘Are You Experience?’, ‘Axis Bold As Love’ and ‘Electric Ladyland’ albums influenced the popular music soundscape. Nothing like it had been heard before that time.

In fact, many people say that self-confidence is a gift from the universe and anyone can take advantage of it, regardless of whether they are male or female. If you are shy, you may be trying to overcome that fact and that will help you. However, many people do not take the time to analyze whether or not they have self-confidence, thinking it's just part of their upbringing. It is much more than that, but the real question to ask yourself is whether or not you feel good about who you are. If you are trying to improve your life, you probably are going to go to great lengths to make sure that you look and feel your best. Self-confidence is important and if you have this, it can help you in many different ways. For example, many people say that they feel better about themselves after they eat a healthy meal. The same thing happens when you feel better about yourself. You tend to eat more healthily, take better care of yourself physically and use healthy substances to boost up your mood. It doesn't matter what the reason behind it is, as long as you feel good about yourself. Once you realize that you don't have to put a lot of effort to have self-confidence, you will find that it really comes into play. People who believe they have this kind of power will often go to great lengths to get it. They are willing to spend hours of their lives trying to perfect the art of being confident. It isn't easy though, and they are sometimes frustrated at how hard it can be to maintain it. That frustration will show on their faces and they will become frustrated themselves because they just can't seem to make a big difference. However, the key to becoming more confident is to keep at it until you find success and your mind and body start to believe in what you have to offer. Once your mind and body have been convinced that you are worth of having confidence, you will find that you will enjoy the change in your life."},{"prompt":"What are the best color of loafers to buy that go with almost everything (jeans, chinos)?","completion":"Beige or navy"},{"prompt":"Do you think John Lennon would have been a Nirvana fan?","completion":"Sure, just not “as rabid” as either of their fans are!"},{"prompt":"w can I buy IKEA or IKEAlike furniture in India?","completion":"First IKEA store is open in hyderabad now and soon to open in mumbai and delhi too."},{"prompt":"What is it like being a farmer? Are farmers happy?","completion":"My mom is a farmer and I have seen the trials and prizes of a farmer first hand. Farming is uncertain at its best and downright ruthless at its worst. There are many factors which should click just right to get the perfect yield. The rain must be just right. For crops like maize, rain is a godsend. For onions, it must not be too much. The seeds, fertilizers and pestisides must work as advertised. For example, we are preparing some part of our land for onion cultivation and the first problem we faced was nut grass. It might look innocent to look at, but this thing is a bane for crop yield as they suck in all the water like a greedy pig. Especially onions as they are weak and they would never get enough water if nutgrass is not removed. We usually use Roundup ( a pesticide) for removing nutgrass, but this year we used a different one as it is supposed to be exclusive for nutgrass. But it didn't work as the rain came just two days after spraying. For roundup, it doesn't matter even if it rains after just 8 hours, but for this new pesticide, the ‘no rain' period was four days. Now we have to patch things up fast as time is running out. It takes 15 days to prepare the farm to cultivate after spraying. The land too plays an important role. The land near our home has absolutely no ground water and we have to depend on rainfall. When the rain comes, our wells will come to life as there is a 100 acre pond nearby. Then we can get a maximum of two yields after which we have to wait for rainfall again. On the other hand, we have land in Aliyar which is just near the Aliyar river and there will be an excess of water all through the year. But the land there is not much fertile and coconut trees are the best option there. There will be income all year, but never much profit when compared to crops like onion and Tomato. It also depends on the Market rate. Sometimes the prices will skyrocket and we will rake in the profits. Sometimes the prices won't be even enough to cover the harvest cost, much less the cultivation cost. Most of the times, Farming is a gamble. But as the times change and as the youngsters are taking over, the situation is starting to change. More scientific innovations are coming into use and they are changing the game. As for happiness, My mom is happy when she sees this. Despite all the uncertainties and worries, seeing the green waving around in the wind never fails to bring a smile in the face."},{"prompt":"w can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?","completion":"I’m sorry, but there is no easy way that you can follow to lose weight quickly. Weight lose requires a lot of hard work and dedication if you want to get healthy results. Many people on social media recommend many sources and supplements to get fast results, but the majority of them are scammers who just want to get money. If you are willing to lose weight in a healthier way, try to follow some free method that only requires hard work and consistency. First of all, eating a healthy balanced diet can help you to see fast results. What I mean by a healthy diet is just to try to eat vegetables and fruit. Don't try to spend money on supplements and diet. Consuming enough carbs and protein may show great results. Moreover, Doing regular exercises is one of the effective things that are really responsible for body shape. Lifting lightweight as well as high cardio can change forever from a fat person to a skinny one. But keep in mind that you must every four days per week in order to see results.

I eagerly await a reply from someone who can convince me with their “evidence.”"},{"prompt":"w does microbiology contribute to environmental sustainability through processes like biodegradation and bioremediation?","completion":"Microbiology plays a crucial role in environmental sustainability through processes such as biodegradation and bioremediation. These processes involve the use of microorganisms to break down and remove pollutants from the environment, ultimately restoring ecosystems and minimizing the impact of human activities. Here's how microbiology contributes to these processes: Biodegradation: Microorganisms have the ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds, including pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. Certain bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms produce enzymes that can break down complex molecules into simpler, more manageable forms. Through their metabolic activities, microorganisms utilize these compounds as sources of energy and nutrients. By harnessing the natural biodegradative capabilities of microorganisms, we can effectively mitigate the environmental contamination caused by various pollutants.Bioremediation: Bioremediation involves the use of microorganisms to clean up contaminated sites. There are two main types of bioremediation: in situ and ex situ.a. In situ bioremediation: In this approach, microorganisms are introduced directly into the contaminated site. They utilize the pollutants as a food source and degrade them into less harmful byproducts. This process can be enhanced by providing necessary nutrients, oxygen, or optimizing environmental conditions to support microbial growth and activity.b. Ex situ bioremediation: In ex situ bioremediation, contaminated materials are excavated and treated in a controlled environment outside the site. Microorganisms are added to the contaminated material, such as soil or water, and provided with optimal conditions for biodegradation. Once the contaminants are broken down, the treated material can be returned to the site or disposed of safely. Both in situ and ex situ bioremediation methods can be used for different types of pollutants and environmental conditions. Microorganisms can be naturally occurring or genetically engineered to enhance their biodegradative capabilities and increase the efficiency of the remediation process. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation: Bioaugmentation involves the addition of specific microorganisms to enhance the degradation of certain pollutants that are not readily biodegradable by the existing microbial community. Biostimulation, on the other hand, focuses on stimulating the growth and activity of indigenous microorganisms already present at the contaminated site. These approaches often involve providing additional nutrients, altering environmental conditions, or introducing electron acceptors such as oxygen to enhance microbial activity and pollutant degradation. By utilizing microbiology-based processes like biodegradation and bioremediation, we can effectively reduce the levels of contaminants in the environment, restore ecosystems, and promote environmental sustainability. These approaches offer cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional remediation methods and contribute to long-term preservation of our natural resources."},{"prompt":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","completion":"🔔 The best telegram Channel/ groups for UPSC Civil services preparation:- Link: 👉 [LINKED_TEXT: EXAM SNAP] [URL: https://t.me/ExamSnapofficial] [LINKED_TEXT: Exam Snap™ (UPSC)📜All UPSC/PSC and other govt exams related info & materials at one place📜 ◾️UPSC Civil Services Prelims & Mains ◾️State PCS ◾️ UPPCS, UKPCS, BPSC, HPSC #UPSC #thehindu #civilservices #IAS #Editorialanalysis #currentaffairs #IAS #IPShttps://t.me/ExamSnapofficial] [URL: https://t.me/ExamSnapofficial]Keep smiling, God bless you all :)"},{"prompt":"Why does my cat smell so good, despite me never giving him a bath in his entire life?","completion":"Cats in good health meticulously spend hours every day bathing themselves and their saliva contains a natural deodorant which evolutionarily helped them survive by being less detectable to other predators! :)"},{"prompt":"f buying a new, high end road bike and you can only choose one, do you go with electronic shifting or disc brakes?","completion":"If you actually want disc brakes… than disc brakes. Electronic shifting is nice, but first adopters of electronic groupsets are paying a high premium for a system which is fundamentally simpler than a fine mechanical one. In five years electronic shifting will filter down to the budget groupset level, and every decent road bike will have it as the top end groupsets will move to the next best thing. Personally, I’d first budget it so I have a power meter on the bike, though, even speccing the rest of it down. If I could only afford mechanical 105 and rim brakes, but could afford to upgrade with a power meter, a good saddle and a pair of good tires, that's really something I could live with and better than a stock bike with electronic shifting. It's just a huge help in training and for pacing. Even a huge climb becomes a simple matter of riding by the numbers (if you have adequate gearing). How cool is that! Picture above: Getting from sea level to the top is a lot less intimidating once you know all you need to do is to hold 200W for two hours and change (barring the odd ramp where you have to go a bit higher and a flatter bit 2/3rds of the way in where you can recover a bit) and you’ll be up there, easily within the abilities of the average rider. If I can afford this with budget to spare, then I’d go for discs which I am a fan of, unless I am building a steel bike where I’d take rim brakes for the style of it. Personally, I’m happy with mechanical 105 and mechanical TRP Spyre disc brakes on my road bike."},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"9445739073"},{"prompt":"w many cars can fit on a cargo ship?","completion":"Höegh Target is the world's largest Pure Car and Truck Carrier (PCTC) vessel with a carrying capacity of 8,500 car equivalent units.

The only difference here is that they use assistive technologies to access the computer and the programming language. These assistive technologies include a screen reader, braille display, or speech recognition software. The role of the screen reader is to read the content on the screen through raised dots. And the speech recognition software interprets the spoken commands and translates them into typed commands. Here, website accessibility also plays an important role, as visually impaired individuals won't be able to code if the software or website they are using to code is not accessible to these assistive technologies. This also allows visually impaired programmers to customize their computer environment and programming language. For instance, they can increase their screen's font size or contrast or adjust their text editor to be more accessible. This includes increasing the verbal feedback the software receives when typing in commands or even adding text-to-speech for commands and feedback. Some zooming software also allows visually impaired programmers to zoom in on text and other elements of the user interface, making them easier to see. With the help of different accessible IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), visually impaired individuals can easily program. This software includes features such as keyboard navigation, text-to-speech, and braille support. Here are some examples of visually impaired computer programmers who have made significant contributions to the field: Ray Kurzweil: Ray Kurzweil is a blind American computer scientist and futurist. He is best known for his work on artificial intelligence, speech recognition, and text-to-speech software.Daniel Kish: Daniel Kish is a blind American man who uses echolocation to navigate the world. He is the founder of World Access for the Blind, a non-profit organization that provides training and support for blind people who want to learn echolocation. The above are only a few examples; there might be a lot more visually impaired individuals who are successful programmers. These are some ways in which visually impaired computer programmers can program more easily and effectively. With the use of assistive technology and website accessibility, they can now have equal access to programming language, and by adjusting their environment, they can make the entire programming experience more accessible and comfortable."},{"prompt":"w do you know dinosaurs actually existed just other than fossils?","completion":"If you take the whole collection of fossils as just fossils, including the trace evidence, then that is what we have.

Norway found oil outside this limit and claimed 200 miles. Quiet. Many other countries took similar steps. Quiet.In 1967, when Egypt wanted to wage war on Israel, Egypt closed the Tiran Straits to Israel’s shipping. The Tiran Straits were international waters.

Throughout my life I experienced everything from Ritz-Carlton to decrepit crew sleeping room at Pugachovka glider airfield in Oryol region in Russia… that was where the bed broke under me in the middle of the night while I slept calmly (although that wasn’t an hotel). Last five nights I spent at the Russian research MV Gelendzhik faring through the Sea of Japan, and 27-year old bunks here are comfortable enough for me. Beds at the Ritz-Carlton are too soft for my taste. I like it in Ibis and Azimut. Tower Hill Hotel in Busan (South Korea) is really nice as are Vincci Maritimo in Barcelona (Besos Mar), Tygyn Darkhan in Yakutsk and Park Inn Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg Pulkovo. The best hostels I stayed at are Hush Kadıköy Moda in Istanbul, Turkey (they have really sumptuous breakfasts), Orange Vaclavske Namestí in Prague, Czechia (excellent location at very good price), and DIC in Ljubljana, Slovenia (open only during summer). And the best guesthouse ever is Kakoste in Gozd Martuljek, Slovenia."},{"prompt":"am 15 years old.

You will always impress investors with results rather than an idea. Also keep in mind, you need to show that it does or can in time make money. Investors want to know how they will ultimately get their money back so if there is no path to monetization then no one will be interested in funding it. I would start but understanding what is needed to code your first app. There’s is plenty of free information on how to do this online.

It implies the presence of the deepest connection of [LINKED_TEXT: friendship] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends], of lives lived as comrades from the distant past. Many of us have people in our lives with whom we feel the bond described by the word kenzoku. They may be family members, a mother, a brother, a daughter, a cousin. Or a friend from grammar school with whom we haven't talked in decades. Time and distance do nothing to diminish the bond we have with these kinds of friends. The question then arises: why do we have the kind of chemistry encapsulated by the word kenzoku with only a few people we know and not scores of others? The closer we look for the answer the more elusive it becomes. It may not in fact be possible to know, but the characteristics that define a kenzoku relationship most certainly are. What draws people together as friends? Common interests. This probably ties us closer to our friends than many would like to admit. When our interests diverge and we can find nothing to enjoy jointly, time spent together tends to rapidly diminish. Not that we can't still care deeply about friends with whom we no longer share common interests, but it's probably uncommon for such friends to interact on a regular basis.History. Nothing ties people together, even people with little in common, than having gone through the same difficult experience. As the sole glue to keep friendships whole in the long run, however, it often dries, cracks, and ultimately fails.Common values. Though not necessarily enough to create a friendship, if values are too divergent, it's difficult for a friendship to thrive.Equality. If one friend needs the support of the other on a consistent basis such that the person depended upon receives no benefit other than the opportunity to support and encourage, while the relationship may be significant and valuable, it can't be said to define a true friendship. What makes a friend worthy of the name? A commitment to your [LINKED_TEXT: happiness] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness]. A true friend is consistently willing to put your happiness before your friendship. It's said that \\"good advice grates on the ear,\\" but a true friend won't refrain from telling you something you don't want to hear, something that may even risk fracturing the friendship, if hearing it lies in your best interest. A true friend will not lack the mercy to correct you when you're wrong. A true friend will confront you with your drinking problem as quickly as inform you about a malignant-looking skin lesion on your back that you can't see yourself.Not asking you to place the friendship before your principles. A true friend won't ask you to compromise your principles in the name of your friendship or anything else. Ever.A good influence. A true friend inspires you to live up to your best potential, not to indulge your basest drives. Of course, we may have friends who fit all these criteria and still don't quite feel kenzoku. There still seems to be an extra factor, an [LINKED_TEXT: attraction] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mating] similar to that which draws people together romantically, that cements friends together irrevocably, often immediately, for no reason either person can identify. But when you find these people, these kenzoku, they're like priceless gems. They're like finding home. How to attract true friends This one is easy, at least on paper: become a true friend yourself. One of my favorite quotations comes from Gandhi: \\"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\\" Be the friend you want to have. We all tend to attract people into our lives whose character mirrors our own. You don't have to make yourself into what you think others would find attractive. No matter what your areas of interest, others share them somewhere. Simply make yourself a big target. Join social clubs organized around activities you enjoy. Leverage the Internet to find people of like mind. Take action. As I thought about it, there's merely one individual in my life I consider kenzoku.

The image served as a symbol of people’s defiance against authority and has been used for such purpose for many years now. Many thought he was crushed by the tanks or killed or jailed. Watch the following video that included an ending which news outlets like CNN and BBC like to cut in their videos, but gave an important context of the event: The event happened on June 5, not June 4; the tank was leaving Tiananmen Square, not entering. The “tank man” was dragged away by other bystanders at the end of the video, he was not captured by the PLA, nor there was any police around. The authority had no idea who he was, Jiang Zhemin was really confused when he was asked about him in a later interview by an American TV show. The tank stopped as you can see in the video and tried their best to avoid him, no police or soldiers came out beat him. To most Chinese, June 4 is like a bad dream, it has nothing to do with the freedom and democracy that the US invades other countries over, the students wanted to get rid of the corruption that came with the economic reform, but not sure how; the whole event caused more destruction to the political reform of China than any good that came out of it, the liberal faction of CCP was decimated afterwards for failed attempts to work with the students, and that must have delayed the democratic reform for decades. I don’t know what to think, as I originally thought that the picture was shot on June 4, the “Tank Man” was trying to stop the tanks moving into the square, and he was crushed after the photo was taken, then I learned that none of what I was led to believe was true. Nowadays, whenever there is a protest, there always will be a photo, staged or not, that shows a lone individual standing up against authority, it does make good propaganda, doesn’t it."},{"prompt":"Can you burst a weather balloon with your bare hands?","completion":"Probably not.

So learn to reduce your silly mistakes else it may change your honeymoon destination. There are important tips for reducing silly mistakes which I have shared in one course of Unacademy. You can go through it. The name of the course is Preparation strategy and Approach for GATE exam.Few Snippets My silly mistakes during GATE-2018 I could have got 84–85 marks in GATE-2018 but I did 9–10 marks silly mistakes and eventually I got 75.26 marks in GATE-18. Give test series as much as possible. It will help you to practice virtual calculator and will help to know your silly mistakes, strength & weaknesses. How to attempt test series also has been shared in my same course which is mentioned above.Don't forget to analyze the test series. Analyze your mistakes , learn from it and make a separate notes . Lots of new Concepts can be learnt from the test series also make a notes of it. Analysis of test series should be done like this. Analyze your correct and incorrect answer both . Why correct Question should be analysed? Becoz You may find some new approach in the solution which may help you in future. You may refer my course on the Unacademy platform.Revise regularly those notes else you'll forget everything because those stuffs in notes are your weaknesses so work on it regularly.Revise the short notes and subjects very well . Lack of revision will lead to less marks in GATE. Revision should be done at the end of every month and week.Try to write down all the formulae and at the same time you must know where you can apply that particular formulae. Eg. If you are learning Bernoulli's principle then also learn where it can be applied Like steady incompressible and inviscid flow should be there to apply.I used to practice writing formulae on a rough copy so that I don't skip any question just because I didn't remember the formulae. There are some direct easy questions come in GATE for that formulae is necessary. Also I didn't want to waste my time in recalling the formulae during exam. The above points which I have shared should be kept in mind if you don't want to commit any mistakes during your exam. It's better to take precaution before it happens.

Here are a few examples: Advantages: Improved collaboration: Project management software can help teams collaborate more effectively by providing a central location for all project-related information, including tasks, files, and discussions.Increased efficiency: Project management software can help teams work more efficiently by providing tools for task prioritization, delegation, and tracking.Improved transparency: Project management software can provide transparency into project progress and status, helping teams stay aligned on project goals and timelines.Easier reporting: Project management software can provide easy access to project reports, such as burn-down charts or task completion rates, which can help teams identify areas for improvement. Disadvantages: Learning curve: Project management software often has a steep learning curve, which can make it difficult for teams to adopt and use effectively.Overreliance on technology: Project management software can make teams overreliant on technology, which can be problematic if there are issues with the software or if team members do not have access to it.Data security concerns: Project management software can create data security concerns, particularly if sensitive project information is stored on third-party servers.Cost: Project management software can be costly, particularly for small teams or startups, which may prefer to use simpler, more affordable solutions. Overall, project management software can be a valuable tool for teams using a Kanban-style approach, but it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully and choose a solution that meets the team's needs and budget."},{"prompt":"Do US soldiers keep their guns?","completion":"If a US Soldier has a personal firearm then they can retain their personal firearm just like any other US citizen.

ASIAN TRADERS BEAT COLUMBUS Trade was taking place between East Asia and the New World hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus arrived in the area in 1492. Archaeologists have made the suggestion following the discovery of a series of bronze artefacts found at the 'Rising Whale' site in Cape Espenberg, Alaska. They found what they believe to be a bronze and leather buckle and a bronze whistle, dating to around A.D. 600. Bronze-working had not been developed at this time in Alaska, and researchers instead believe the artefacts were created in China, Korea or Yakutia. 'We're seeing the interactions, indirect as they are, with these so-called \\"high civilisations\\" of China, Korea or Yakutia,' Owen Mason, a research associate at the University of Colorado. Researchers believe those who lived at the Rising Whale site may be part of what scientists call the 'Birnirk' culture. This is a group of people who lived on both sides of the Bering Strait and used skin boats and harpoons to hunt whales, LiveScience reports. The latest discovery of bronze artefacts backs up earlier evidence for trade between Alaska and other civilisations prior to 1492. He said: 'These ancient Chinese writings in North America cannot be fake, for the markings are very old as are the style of the scripts. 'As such the findings of this scientific study confirm that ancient Chinese people were exploring and positively interacting with the Native peoples over 2,500 years ago. 'The pattern of the finds suggests more of an expedition than settlement.

This week, two major studies of the DNA of living and ancient people try to settle the big questions about the early settlers: who they were, when they came, and how many waves arrived. But instead of converging on a single consensus picture, the studies, published online in Science and Nature, throw up a new mystery: Both detect in modern Native Americans a trace of DNA related to that of native people from Australia and Melanesia. The competing teams, neither of which knew what the other was up to until the last minute, are still trying to reconcile and make sense of each other’s data. “Both models … see in the Americas a subtle signal from” Australo-Melanesians, notes Science co-author David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. “A key difference is when and how it arrived in the New World.” The Nature team concludes it came in one of two early waves of migration into the continent, whereas the Science team concludes it came much later, and was unrelated to the initial peopling."},{"prompt":"IQ test academy really certified or it is a scam?","completion":"The test is far too easy; I believe that the only purpose is to give you a good feeling and of course to buy the very expensive results."},{"prompt":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","completion":"There are several ways to make money online without spending money.

From what I understand, many new aircraft use completely custom non-NACA airfoils, sometimes several different airfoils over the wingspan.

He chose this name so that minority groups living in Azerbaijan too could feel themselves as the part of this country despite the fact Turks had the overall majority in Azerbaijan. Prior to him there was no such a name or concept and the ones living both northern and southern Azerbaijan initially had some certain difficulties in pronouncing that word (some of them were prononucing it as “Azarbaijan” or “Edilbeijan” or “İtilbeijan” or “Azarbeiijan” etc rather than the correct pronounciation of the word which Azerbaijan). All of those people living in both northern and southern Azerbaijan were identifying themselves with just one word and that was Turk or Turkish prior to the introduction of this word “Azerbaijan”. For the record Shah Ismail l wasn’t speaking or writing poems in Azerbaijan Turkish. He was writing his poems in a common Turkish which was used in Iran, Iraq and Anatolia at his time. It’s also important to note that Turkish spoken in Turkey in 1940s was much closer to Azerbaijan Turkish and the Turkish spoken by Shah Ismail. The word Turkic is the invention of Soviet ideology which tries to solve the problem what is referred as “nations question” within Soviet union by first separating people from Turkish ethnicity from the Turks living in Turkey and then giving them tribal names and thus banning them to use the word of Turk or Turkish to identify their ethnicity. So Turkic was an ideal innovation for them. Prior to the invasion of Turkish lands in Central Asia and Caucasus by first Russian Empire (in the 19th century) and then the former Soviet Union (in the early 20th century) those people belonging to Turkish ethnicity (just like the Turks in Turkey) were always uttering the word “Turk” (or Turkish which is the English form of saying Turk and the language Turks speak) while talking about their ethnicity. When Turks embraced Islam they not only changed their religion but also ultimately their life styles and thus they left one civilization circle which they belonged and entered Islamic civilization circle. Azerbaijan Turks and Anatolian Turks were initially representing the Turkish culture after entering the Islamic civilization (just like the rest of the Turkish groups in Central Asia). They’re later both exposed to western civilization but ended up entering in different influences as they (except Turkey) lost their sovereignities. Turks living in Turkey as a sovereign nation are more explicit about their ethnicity and they do not hesitate to call the ones from Turkish ethnicity like themselves “Turks” or “Turkish” rather than Turkic (for them all the historical empires founded by the people from the same ethnicity with themselves too were Turkish empires not Turkic) but for the Turks living in southern Azerbaijan in Iran and northern Azebaijan the word “Turk” was something like taboo as they were captive nations. Today people from northern Azerbaijan after gaining their independence are more courageous to use the word “Turk” and “Turkish” rather than Turkic. Yet, there’re still some groups within Azerbaijan which are either still under the influence of Soviet ideology or suffer from the concept what’s known as learned helplessness in psychology are reluctant to use the word “Turk” or “Turkish” and prefer the word “Turkic” instead. The ones in Iran are still a captive nation and thus they use the terms like “Azerbaijani”, “Irani” or “Turkic” depending on how close they feel themselves to the current mullah regime in Iran despite the fact that objectively speaking they’re Turk or Turkish. BTW ethnicity and nationality are two slightly different concepts. Ethnicity is more related with the culture and thus language (which is the most important aspect of culture) and the sense of belonging and sense of identity. Nationality is more to do with the citizenship of the people which is about their citizenship rights. In modern states the citizens living in one country have all the same citizenship rights regardless their ethnicities. In the older times different ethnic groups living in one state could have different citizenship rights."},{"prompt":"Which is a better band: Iron Maiden or Judas Priest?","completion":"You can't compare the two, in the same way that you can't choose the better song between \\"Panikiller - Judas Priest\\" and \\"Fear of the Dark - Iron Maiden\\"."},{"prompt":"w do airports ensure that luggage of one passenger is not picked by another at the baggage claim area?","completion":"The reason for this is that true stealing is rare.

There isn’t a thing like “I am doing this so I am genuine” for them. What you see them doing is what you see in them. Pure raw content."},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Having strong self-confidence will allow you to obtain any goal you set for yourself. It’s not always easy having confidence in yourself, but it’s how you develop a positive mindset. If you lack confidence then it can be the underlying cause of what’s holding you back from taking the next step. I never really had any confidence in myself until I learned that lack of it was causing my negative thoughts and behaviors to increase. Here’s what has helped me have more confidence in myself: 1)Taking calculated risks One of the key pillars to strengthening your self confidence is taking more strategic risks. This is one of the key habits of the ultra successful. Realize that every risk you don’t take is another opportunity missed. When you don’t take action on what is important to you, it takes a hard hit on your confidence meter. By taking calculated risks you decide to do something that’s going to add value to your life or someone else’s. Most of the people who read this aren’t going to do anything after they finish because they’re scared and lazy. Start discovering what it is you want to learn, teach or master. Your confidence strengthens by having utmost faith in your decision making. You must start trusting your intuition. Are your daily habits aligned with where you want to go? If you aren’t pursuing calculated goals, then it’s going to be difficult reaching your destination. You should be doing something everyday that helps bring your vision to life. It’s the small steps that engineer the foundation of your success. 2)Find your voice You mustn’t allow the opinions of your family, friends, or society paralyze your choice of going after your goals and dreams. The people that are going to give you the most criticism will be the individuals closest to you. In the midst of all the noise you must try to hear your own inner voice. When you begin pursuing the stuff you’re interested in, you set the foundation for identifying your passions are and aren’t. Take the time to listen to what that inner voice is trying to tell you. There’s always going to be people that unintentionally interfere with your personal growth. These people tend to project their fears and uncertainty onto others unconsciously. They don’t have awareness of their thoughts or behaviors. YOU are the only person who has control over the outcome of your reality. Sometimes that inner voice isn't you. It’s the accumulation of what you have been conditioned to believe about yourself. Follow your heart and don't be afraid to pursue things that you find interesting or inspirational. 3)Embrace failure An important thing to remember about failure is that it teaches you where you need to improve. Failure isn’t something you should be afraid of because it lays the foundation of the lessons that you need to learn. It’s through trial and error that you educate yourself about what your strengths and weaknesses are. The key to self-improvement is figuring out what kind of thoughts and emotions are most beneficial in helping you reach your goals. By failing forward you enable your mind to become adaptable when you face challenges. When you are going after big goals there is going to be times where you will fail and that’s okay. You must take a step back from the situation and be aware of what you can learn from that challenge. The more you fail at something the less chance you have at failing again. This kind of mentality plays a major role in helping you stay committed to attaining your goals. Remember… By taking calculated risks you increase your chances of reaching any goal you set for yourself. Listen to your inner voice because it will help you on your mission. Don't be afraid to fail because it’s the only way for you to improve. As long as you’re making progress you’ll get where you need to be. Be patient. Thank you for reading!

This has led some people to theorize that, even after overwriting a sector, it may be possible to examine each sector’s magnetic field with a magnetic force microscope and determine its previous state.

Many tools have built-in settings to perform up to 35 write passes – this is known as the “Gutmann method,” after Peter Gutmann, who wrote an important paper on the subject — “Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory,” published in 1996.

Andrew is supposedly the Queen’s favourite child but for obvious and embarrassing reasons almost certainly doesn’t have much influence with her in general right now, and on the specific point of Charles becoming King he would be perfectly aware that this is certainly not up to him and not even up to the Queen herself. The law say Charles will be King and that’s that. Only if Charles himself chooses not to (spoiler: this almost certainly will not happen) or predeceases the Queen (not impossible but not super-likely either) will that change, and the law is equally clear that William is next in line and has been since 1982 when he was born.

When you smoke marijuana you get high and you'll probably get a little hungry a little tired a little sleepy you probably won't want to fight anybody and you probably don't want to drive but if you do Drive you'll probably be able to. In my case with alcohol it just ends up being a lot of empty calories and making me feel like s*** the end of the day there's absolutely no health benefits to drinking alcohol. With marijuana I'm not going to say this health benefits but it's not a consumable where I'm gaining calories I don't feel as shity as I do with I'll call a little bit of sluggish yeah maybe. I might do a little bit of eating after with the munchies but other than that I feel much better smoking marijuana that I do drinking liquor."},{"prompt":"What is the deal with the V in US Navy abbreviations (e.g., VFA, VAL, VAQ)?","completion":"It is actually from the French word, ”Voler”, which means heavier than air. It all goes back to the first carrier. They could not call an attack carrier a “CA”, because then it would be confused with the “CA” that meant “Cruiser, Attack”. So, carriers were labeled as “CV”’s. So, squadrons that use heavier than air airplanes are VA for attack squadrons and VF for fighter squadrons an VQ for electronic warfare squadrons, etc. —And squadrons that use helicopters are called HA’s etc. and ships that use lighter than air aircraft (like blimps) are called CZ’s. See? Quite simple. Trust me, about a week of that and learning how to tell time in the Navy and trying to understand why you must wear cammies on a ship and call a bathroom a head, and it will all make sense. Then they will try to explain that you can have a “Bulkhead” in other rooms besides a bathroom, and you do not need grease for relative bearings. It is all quite simple."},{"prompt":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","completion":"Lower back pain can have many different causes, one of them being lumbar radiculopathy (sciatica).

It covers the information in \\"AP style\\"-- a classic pyramid reporting framework, with a classic lede, after that developing the story with more detail in each successive paragraph.

AP reporters are trained to focus on realities in their news stories because for some readers in smaller cities whose neighborhood documents don't have Washington contributors, etc., that will be what they review a White House press instruction or a High court judgment. An evaluation or function tale is clearly identified as simply that. Reuters is one more wire service of the same kind-- although it is based in the UK, it has a considerable US network (enormous United States headquarters in Times Square, New York City). To a somewhat minimal degree, I would certainly state that Bloomberg is great, although extra in specific locations, such as organization and US national politics, and less so on regional news throughout the United States as well as it covers much less ground worldwide; it likewise may be somewhat most likely to have a political tilt and also its opinion items or expectation pieces are more greatly promoted, therefore. - Guest Posting Service Provider Those would certainly be my choices, as a reporter who places a top priority on facts. Now, if you happen to be an individual that has a certain political POV-- you identify yourself as modern or as part of the Tea ceremony or whatever-- your response will certainly be extremely various.

While I have my own political viewpoints, I do not occur to share this view, and also do not believe that living in a media echo chamber corresponds to obtaining \\"objective and factual\\" info. It simply suggests obtaining information with a tilt-- whether in its story choice, the option of visitors to review the events of the day, or series of viewpoint tales, that makes you nod your head sagely and also say, yup, they understand what they're discussing.

It was the English Monarchy, which quartered Redcoats in our home, silenced dissidents, taxed us without representation, took away a fair trial, and other things. Every one of the 10 Amendments can be linked to what a tyrannical government did to you. On the topic of heinous tyranny requiring arms, let me direct your attention to: The HolocaustHundreds of genocides throughout historyThe treatment of many innocents in African and Middle East countries. A cousin of a family I know was recently murdered for being Christian.The Battle of Athens - corrupt local government, WWII vets fought back, DoJ had ignored complaints In summary, nothing the US gov’t did, but the nature of governments allows for tyrannies to be easily constructed.

You resigned and are no longer an employee of theirs therefore you are under no obligation to provide assistance. That said, you can choose to help them (if they were nice while you worked there), refuse outright or tell them your time is valuable and you can work as a consultant for 50 per hour (or double whatever you were making while you were there) with a three hour minimum, time starting from the moment you leave your home. And if they refuse to pay after the first time, the second time they call you double your rate and tell them they have to pay what they owe you PLUS give you a cash deposit equal to an 8 hour day, up front.

But I couldn’t find enough interesting and well-paid work in my profession, so for me leaving California was the worst thing ever. Now we split our time between Los Angeles and New York and I can’t imagine it any other way. I don’t mind the politics too much, sometimes the ultra left go a bit far but it’s been less stressful than the flat-Earthers and climate change deniers and the too-far-to-the-right politics I’ve found in abundance elsewhere. And yes, in California the taxes are high but for me so are the opportunities. And it’s insanely beautiful here. I haven’t found a better place to be, for me.

It started with a fair amount of people in it, but by the end, it was just me and my two friends because the movie sucked so badly, and we weren’t even enjoying the film. We just sat in silence. We didn’t even talk about it when it was over.I and the friends I was at the movie with had a landscaping business this summer, and one of our old customers walked in with his wife right before the movie started. He happened to be the customer who fired us for bad communication, and also the one whom we ended up scamming (we were 16 year old’s with no idea how to run a business, it was unintentional). Our old pal looked up at the three of us, shook his head, and looked away. My fellow CEO’s and I made an executive decision not to go over and say hello…At one point in the movie, I went and stood by the side-door because I was feeling restless and wanted to stretch a bit, and I happened to kick this really cute girl right in the stomach, and when I apologized she just awkwardly stared at me. Those three things do not make my experience with The New Mutants a fond memory. 2: Tenet Tenet was pretty good, but there was this one lady in the theater, looked like freakin Toucan Sam from the Fruit Loops Commercials. Anyways, every time something crazy and confusing happened (quite often), she’d say- “Ohhh reallllllly, Ya think!?” Like it was the most obvious thing ever and the main characters were just a bunch of idiots. I think her goal was to make all us random strangers in the theater think she was really smart, but she just sounded dumb and everybody wanted her to shut up. 3: X-Men: Apocalypse I’m hesitant to write this one, because we were badly behaved 12-year-old’s at the time, but the guy behind my friend and I really sucked. Ya see, my friend’s Dad is a local news anchor, and he and his family get recognized in public sometimes. Anyways, we were throwing gobstoppers in the theater...as one does...and this one guy leans forward, grabs my friend, and says- “Hey! You! I know your dad! I’ve seen him on TV! You’d better straighten up or I’ll let him know you behaved this way!” That, of course, only encouraged us. So we continued. After the movie, we went to the bathroom, and this dude comes up and pees in the urinal right next to me, just so he can continue to scold me while we’re peeing. He then goes and finds my friend’s dad who was picking us up, and told him what wretched sinners my friend and I were. What a nut job. I might be forgetting some, but those weren’t exactly fun.

PM Modi is a citizen of India. He is a Hindu. As India is secular, he is not guilty for celebrating Diwali. He is not guilty for not celebrating Ramadan. Modi, being the head of the Indian govt., has the right to go to any army camp within the country whenever he wants. Wasting tax payers money is out of question.No one can question him like ”Why did you visit on this day, why not that?” and command him like “You visited on this day. So you should visit on that day too”. This has nothing to do with religion. Modi is a practitioner of Hinduism. He believes Diwali to be an auspicious day and he chose that day to visit the soldiers. That doesn’t disrespect Islam (or any other religion) in any way as beliefs have nothing to do with Islam but the religion he practices, Hinduism. And lastly, for those having these kind of questions, Why does PM Modi celebrate Deepavali every year with the Indian Army, when he does not celebrate Ramadan? Isn't India a secular country? First think how can India be a secular country if even its Head of the State(PM) is criticized for following his own religious beliefs(without violating the constitution)? Not having a state religion doesn’t mean India is atheist(no religion)/pseudo-secular(skew the secularism term in favor of one religion and against another). It means India is secular(respects all beliefs) as the constitution says."},{"prompt":"Social Science","completion":"As an anthropologist I would say the good ol’ yes and no. Most social science aims for proper science stuff, such as sample sizes large enough to be statistically significant, as well as relevant samples to begin with. But the nature of social science is often considered barely scientific at best as it’s mostly based on observational studies. However, given enough observational study data you could apply statistics such that it seems scientific. I always felt it was alright to say it’s a science based school of thought rather than purely scientific. The reason that is important is that if you put folks into an experiment you immediately make them abnormal. Social science thrives on the same things as zoology. We love to observe the human in it’s natural state. Experiments ruin nature. With that, social science is only scientific enough to get the job done.

BMI is a method used to calculate if you are: - Underweight (BMI below 18.5) - Normal Weight (BMI between 18.5-24.9) - Overweight (BMI between 25-29.9) - Obese (BMI above 29.9) Ever thought about these standards used to define body’s fitness? Firstly lets know what is a human body composed of: - Bones - Muscle - Fats - Organs (Internal organs and Skin) - Fluids (Blood and others) Based on the above components, the weight of the body can be determined. Consider two friends, Rope and Tye, the table shows the exact representation of their body mass. They weight the same, but the body components are not proportionate. Both Tye and Roap have the same BMI, but do you see the Highlighted rows, Tye has more fat content and Roap has more muscle weight. According to the normal fat percent, Tye should have Fat weight between 8-19 kgs. So who needs to loose weight? For a case mentioned above, BMI can be misleading. And hence is not considered to be accurate measurement to define a human as overweight, normal or underweight.

But dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago. That is a long time for divergence. Even if we had some dinosaur DNA, which is highly unlikely to happen because DNA does not last for that long (the oldest DNA to be sequenced is <1 million years old), we would have to use birds or crocodile embryos to edit the dinosaur genes into, and the end product would still be more of a bird and a crocodile than a dinosaur. Of course, we can never say never: some soft tissue containing collagen and potentially blood cells has been recovered from a 75 million year old dinosaur . As more museum specimens are analyzed, maybe we can get some proteins sequenced, and try to get a chicken or crocodile embryo to express at least one or two dinosaur proteins. But at the moment, it's just fun science fiction."},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"The towers began collapsing from structural damage and fire damage to the steel reinforcing which was supporting the static load of the floors above. Force equals mass times acceleration. In a static load (i.e. the building as it was before the attack) acceleration is zero, so the lower floors were built to support only mass (as well as some axial wind flexing). When you get the top third of a skyscraper accelerating downwards at (presumably close to) 10m/sec2, the force gets to multiplying really fast. by the time it had collapsed just a few floors it would have become unstoppable, like an avalanche. The forces involved would have been massive, which is why everything got so pulverised."},{"prompt":"What's the best thing I can do as a 15 year old?","completion":"Learn proper typing.

Recent archaeological excavations have revealed more than 5000 inscriptions in Greek on grave stelae and votive offerings. The inscriptions from Macedonia are all written either in Common Attic (Koine) Greek, or a Greek dialect showing affinities both with the north-western (Doric) Greek dialects of Epirus and with the north-eastern (Aeolic) Greek dialects of Thessaly. “The language of the Macedonians was a distinct and particular form of Greek, resistant to outside influences and conservative in pronunciation. It remained so until the fourth century when it was almost totally submerged by the flood tide of standardized Greek.” (Nicholas Hammond, British scholar and expert on Macedon, “A History of Macedonia”, Vol. ii, 550-336 BC) “The evidence for the language of the Macedonians has been reviewed and discussed by Kalleris and Hammond, Griffith, and many others, all contending that it was a dialect of Greek. The increasing volume of surviving public and private inscriptions makes it quite clear that there was no written language but Greek. There may be room for argument over spoken forms, or at least over local survivals of earlier occupancy, but it is hard to imagine what kind of authority might sustain that. There is no evidence for a different “Macedonian” language that cannot be as easily explained in terms of dialect or accent.” (“Cambridge Ancient Histories”, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1998) The Digital Library of Language Relationships, classifies Macedonian as a Hellenic (Greek) language. Not to be confused with the modern North Macedonian language, which is related to the Bulgarian language: “Name: Ancient Macedonian. Parent Subgroup: Hellenic (Greek). Brief Description: The ancient language of the Macedonian kingdom in N. Greece and modern Macedonia during the later 1st millennium BC. Survived until the early 1st millennium AD. Not to be confused with the modern Macedonian language, which is a close relative of the Slavic Bulgarian.

For your own safety don't call her Kate, because vicious royal fans wil accuse you of disrespect, though she’s not on here and can't be. She doesn’t know we exist and has enough work. It’s Waity Kaity that’s rude. Therefore, people those of you who go around Quora telling people off for not calling your beloved duchess, Catherine, I say this: since you have a lot of spare time use it well. Why don't you tell of pseudo-intellectuals, anti waxxers and pseudo-scientists with such zeal? Do you think you’ll get a medal for valiantly defending her and an invitation to tea at Adelaide Cottage? Stop telling people who actually think and behave like intellectuals that they read tabloids, just because they don't accept the sugar-coated version of events. Educated people don’t read tabloids. No, waving an MA in my face doesn’t make you educated, sorry. Think. Is she called Catherine, so formally, by her parents, her siblings, their spouses, her husband, Harry even once the cameras are off and the servants out of earshot? The King and the Queen Consort as well as the Queen might’ve called her Catherine even in private due to a slightly formal relationship between them. Princess Anne might’ve called her Catherine in private as she’s older. Prince Andrew, his brother and the Countess of Wessex rarely met her and I’ve no idea what they would call her if the late Queen wasn't in a room with them or if they were with the Queen at Sandringham. No idea about the Duchess of York. Fergie that is. Dear user call her the Duchess of Cambridge. You don't want people ganging up against you. If you don't call her Catherine you will be called rude by some. I believe you’d know how to behave if you really met her, though. She’s the Princess of Wales now, so be careful."},{"prompt":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","completion":"You know, when I first started out on Quora, I used to answer serious questions (many about immigration), and I got a lot of \\"you don't know what the hell you're talking about\\" comments from random people. It enraged me, and I reported a few of the worst. One guy, in particular, went through my personal social media accounts, published information about me in a comment, and advised me to \\"lawyer up\\". That seemed excessive. I don't get those kinds of comments much anymore, and I think a lot of it has to do with having high-quality followers who speak to my credibility. Sometimes it's hard to untangle the very real phenomenon of \\"mansplaining\\" from just getting \\"know-it-alled\\" on general principles. A know-it-all attitude is common among Quora types. I've got my fair share of it myself. Mansplaining is kind of a special microagression that looks a lot like being a know-it-all on the surface, until you start to notice that the only people who receive the ostensibly \\"helpful\\" comments are women. It's something I would like to go away, but I expect we'll be dealing with it for years and decades to come, since even its perpetrators aren't aware just how foolish it is. More recently, I had a bit of a stalker/troll who was very keen on vandalizing my stuff. Like all trolls, there's no way of knowing this person's identity, or whether they identify as male or female. And it hardly matters. Quora managed to shut it down in short order, for which I'm very thankful. I think that stalker was mainly targeting me based on my Quora visibility, not my sex or gender identity. So yeah, I think for the most part I've been mercifully free of harassment based on gender. Nothing that would really raise an eyebrow, anyway. That being said, I've seen it happen frequently to others. Particularly those who write a lot about relationships. And transwomen. They get the worst of it. It's an ongoing problem, and I'd like to see the Quora team get ahead of it. I believe that better trackability of anonymous user accounts and enhanced blocking features would be a good start. Edit: Actually, I should add something. One thing not mentioned in this question is people who post questions with the apparent intent of making Quora hostile to women. I report and add limited distribution topics to these every day, but at times I feel like the Quora team could be much more proactive in following up.

The first of these was to dramatically widen the range of sound that we expected from the guitar. Hendrix changed the way we hear the guitar, by playing it differently from the way guitarists had played it before him. One of the main ways he did this was to play it very much louder than anyone had played it before. If you watch early footage of Hendrix at the beginning of a performance, before he actually starts playing, you’ll often see him look at the audience and stick his fingers in his ears, to signify that they are unprepared for the sound he’s about to make and need to cover their ears. I’ve read an account of what it was like for early listeners to be at Hendrix gigs: the sheer volume of sound made people feel ill. Hendrix needed to play this loud because he needed the sound from his speakers to cause his guitar to vibrate, giving him access to controlled feedback. This in turn changed the ADSR (attack-decay-sustain-release) envelope of his guitar tone. Before Hendrix, guitarists were used to striking notes and hearing them more or less slowly die away. Eric Clapton was one of the first guitarists to pursue a tone that would sustain for a very long time. Hendrix was much more ambitious than that. He wanted to be able to fade his guitar in, live on stage, and hold a note indefinitely, making his guitar sound more like a giant electric violin or organ. He liked to incorporate sheer noise into his playing in a musical way; this is what he does in his famous performance of the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’, using noise to mimic the sound of gunfire and bombardment and playing the melody of the US national anthem against it. We’re used to this now. It’s been part of the lexicon of guitar techniques for over 50 years. Because Hendrix introduced it. Nowadays it’s possible for guitarists to get effects like these at lower volumes, using effects pedals. But Hendrix didn’t have access to the kind of sophisticated pedals we have nowadays. He had a wah-wah, a distortion pedal and in some performances he used a Uni-Vibe, a kind of footpedal-controlled phase shifter. For the rest, he relied on his hands, his ears and his gear. The remarkable thing is that not only was Hendrix the first guitarist to systematically exploit the sound of the electric guitar in this way, he was also very good at it. In music, the actual innovators sometimes don’t bring out the potential of their innovations, which is left to their successors to do. But Hendrix was very, very good at controlling and sculpting his sound; he didn’t just dick around with noise, the way less gifted players did. He was a beautiful player at lower volumes too. Hendrix did other things which have been influential, such as incorporating different kinds of music (blues, R&B, heavy rock, jazz, folk) into his playing. But I think his biggest influence came from the way he vastly expanded our sense of the guitar’s timbral palette. Hendrix’s sense of his own music was so broad and so complete that guitarists that were directly influenced by him had to pick and choose how they wanted to be influenced by him. Nobody could absorb everything that he’d done. Most of them adopted the volume and the fuzz, but shied away from the improvisatory wildness in his playing, the sense that he’s just barely on the edge of chaos. Very few of them attempted to emulate his superb rhythm playing, unfortunately. That, I think, is why it’s taken generations for guitarists to really incorporate what Hendrix did into their music. Guitarists like Clapton, Page and Beck, who were his peers, had already absorbed their own different sets of influences and were well on the way to creating their own sound when they first heard Hendrix. Clapton experimented with a wah-wah before retreating from any attempt to directly emulate Hendrix. Beck moved away from rock and towards jazz-rock. Page, I think, learned from Hendrix’s sense of orchestration, and became a great producer and creator of soundscapes (in collaboration with his gifted colleague John Paul Jones), but as a live player I think Page is basically a 50s rock & roller turned up really loud. Years later, you see a guitarist like Adrian Belew emulating Hendrix’s command of noise and feedback, but in a basically comic mode. Frank Zappa became a great improviser on guitar, but only after writing a lot of instrumental music which dramatically improved his sense of rhythm. Other guitarists have aimed to be as expressive as Hendrix was, without trying to sound like him. Which is maybe his most positive legacy: to inspire people to try to be as creative as he was."},{"prompt":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey?

This is very good for your posture and put less stress on your joints and kneels. The bike comes with an oversized padded seat, which is a defining feature.

Have you ever felt conscious about your smile because of your crooked or stained teeth? If yes, then cosmetic dentistry services are the perfect solution for you. They will improve the condition of your damaged teeth in all its aspects, ranging from the shape, color, position, size to alignment, making your overall smile pleasant. What Is The Role Of A Cosmetic Dentist? Conventional dental procedures concentrated more on the prevention and remedy of diseases, however, cosmetic dentistry is all about enhancing the appearance and look of your teeth, thus overall face. There are a variety of procedures in cosmetic dentistry to choose from - Inlays/Onlays, teeth whitening, composite bonding, dental implants, dental veneers, full mouth reconstruction, and smile makeover are some of the most popular ones. What Is [LINKED_TEXT: Teeth whitening] [URL: https://dentalpanache.com/teeth-whitening-in-gurgaon/]? Is It Helpful? Teeth whitening is a natural process of lightening the color of the teeth.

Though some individuals also have naturally yellowish teeth. Teeth Whitening Procedure - Professional teeth whitening exhibits exceptional results and you can see your teeth getting lighter than their natural color in only a few appointments. Here are the steps involved in the teeth whitening process - The first step is to polish the teeth with pumice in order to get rid of excess plaque. Next, the dentist will place a barrier along the gumline that will protect your teeth and gums throughout the procedure. In the following step, teeth are coated with whitening solution and are left to be reapplied for 30 – 60 minutes considering various factors. Next, the dentists will use a Curing with light or laser and activate the whitening solution. After the optimum shade arrives, you’ll then have to clean your teeth and get rid of any excess solution.

There seems to be a significantly larger portion of engineering students in India than in the US. Is the perception of engineering different? If so, why?","completion":"Well , according to common beliefs and dormant mindset, there are only three options to choose from : Engineering, Medical and Commerce because people (read parents) do not generally support music,arts,sports as a career [LINKED_TEXT: path.So] [URL: http://path.so/] I will mainly focus my answer on these three. Why not Commerce ?Believe it or not, the main goal of Indian Education system is to improve literacy rate.There is a humongous number dropping out of schools at primary,high school and even graduate level due to financial or social reasons (but that is a story for another time).So the government ,in its efforts to prevent students dropping out makes and grades Matriculation examination papers sympathetically.The real story begins here. Since a fairly average child will get good marks,people especially parents will think that he/she is outrightly intelligent.This prompts them to force their child to take Science instead of commerce because Commerce is still looked down upon by many people and Science is supposed to be belonging to only elite classes. So the main reason that students do not take commerce is because of the social taboo of intellectual bias between science and commerce (which I outrightly despise). So one down.Why not medical ? Money honey.Unless you have a mammoth amount of money, you can't make it to a doctor.Corruption has increased so much in this field that if you want to be a doctor, you have to shell out atleast a crore before you make your name.Even if you have a great merit rank, you have to spend a lot to complete your education.Not to mention, the situation being worse if you are just an average student. So unless you are rich or very very much studious,its an out of bounds option. Hence, we are left with only engineering.One more reason why people take it is we are forced to believe that Engineering is more about maths than science. It's not.Our primary education is so weakly structured that it leads us to believe that if we are good at math,we must take engineering.This is the linchpin due to which most students get lured away into taking engineering. Due to these flaws of our high school education, students set out to become so called \\"engineers\\" with no interest in science."},{"prompt":"Why did punk rock die?","completion":"Because everything runs it’s course.

If you're able to save more than 30k a year or have substantial liquidity (over 200k), being a landlord is a great way to start and how I went from one rental in 2009 to 11 in 2015. I want to share my three rules of investing with you. These are the principles I follow in real estate and they've served me well: Evaluate income and expenses for positive cashflow: When considering an investment, make sure that the income generated from the property or asset exceeds your expenses. Positive cashflow is key to a successful investment.Leverage with favorable debt terms: Take advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to leverage your investments. This allows you to maximize your returns and grow your portfolio faster.Hard asset: Focus on investing in tangible assets that hold value over time. Things like real estate or physical commodities are considered hard assets because they provide stability and can be held for the long term.BONUS - Taxes: Rentals and Syndications offer tax advantages similar to direct investing in single-family homes, but with even more benefits. Larger deals often conduct cost segregation studies, which can maximize depreciation deductions and provide additional tax advantages. This means you can potentially reduce your taxable income and keep more of your earnings. Now, let's talk about gold and crypto. While gold is indeed a hard asset, it doesn't produce cashflow or provide leverage. It's a valuable store of wealth, but it doesn't generate income on its own. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may have gained popularity, but they also lack cashflow and leverage. So, it's important to consider these factors when deciding where to invest your hard-earned money."},{"prompt":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","completion":"He will have to study Newton's three laws of motion first."},{"prompt":"What are the names of the continents in ancient Tamil literature?","completion":"Ancient Tamils did not know any continents as we know them. Not only Tamils, no one had any clue those days about how our world actually looked like. Now look at this map. This was world as envisioned by Romans in 1st century CE. [Source - Google] This is how Romans imagined their world. And these guys explored lot of areas (invaded actually) compared to Tamils. Even they had no idea about our world.

Now coming to Tamil literature, except for the mythical Pahruli river and Kumari Naadu, there is no mention of any continent to my knowledge. All this lemuria business started only in 19th century. Lemuria hypothesis was credible at that time then Wagner came and replaced that with more scientific continental drift. Things I really like about my ancient Tamil ancestors: They only mentioned such fables as a passing mention in their works.They did not build a mythical world around Pahruli and write phantasmagoria.Compared to the recent conspiracy theorists (who ironically have access to scientific information), my ancestors were pragmatic and carried on with more important things in life than spinning elaborate fables.They could have written epic tales of deluge, resurrection etc. But they chose not to and instead told us about love in detail. Think about it when you have time - with such rich and document ancient literature, we did not do one thing - NO FABLES or MYTHOLOGY in Tamil literature. Even our Great Epics are devoid of imagination that went on an overdrive (except may be Sivaga Sinthamani to an extent). No Kukulkan, Virococha, Valhalla, Zeus. Nothing.

The Vedas have entire Narayana Sukta which specify Narayana as Supreme God equivalent to Allah of Islam, Yeswa in Judaism, God in Christianity, example: “pati visvasyatmesvaragï sasvatagï sivamacyutam, narayana mahajñeya visvatmana parayanam.” here visva means universe “om sahasrasira deva visvaksa visvasambhuva, visva narayana devamaksara parama padam.” here viswasambhuvam means universe including earth “narayana param brahma tattva narayana param, narayana paro jyotiratma narayana param. narayana paro dhyata dhyanam narayana param.” here narayana is called parambrahma, not rudra Vedas are like Computer Programs, extremely logical. Here, the Supreme God is specifically named Narayana & Hari. The logic Vedas use is, like this: Narayana (N) or Hari (H) is Supreme Being aka ParabrahmanNarayana (N) or Hari (H) is Rudra (R) for war, to be worshiped by SoldiersNarayana (N) or Hari (H) is Indra (I) for rain, to be worshiped by farmersNarayana (N) or Hari (H) is Agni (A) for yajnas, to be worshiped by Priestsetc Here Narayana (N) or Hari (H) is a class that is instantiated into objects (R) Rudra, Indra (I), Agni (A), etc depending on area like destruction, agriculture, yajna, etc & worshipers. This is why Sanskrit is the best language for programming, logics WHAT IS THE NEED FOR NAME NARAYANA IN VEDAS, WHEN WE HAVE RUDRA, INDRA, AGNI, ETC? In the Vedas, every mantra starts with ‘Harihi Om’, then deity name Rudra or Indra or Agni. ‘Harihi Om’ means ‘in the name of the Supreme Being, the Primordial Essence’ - this is how all Vedic mantras, start. Yes, Rudra is a manifestation of Narayana, for war & destruction, however the single act of destruction, cannot equal everything else, there is more to life & death than just Rudra’s destruction. This is word Narayana, which encompasses everything, all aspects like Rudra/destruction, Agni/purification, Indra/agriculture, etc. After the Vedas, the different Sects started adding their own stories to make their own Sects Supreme & lost the meaning of Parabrahman or Narayana or Hair & mixed it up with Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, etc. The main different sects are: VaisnavasShaivasShakti sect Samudra Madan is story that comes after Vedas, it is not logical like a computer program. Rudra grew in popularity as Shiva because of growing war, Indra’s followers reduced because the Kings cared more about War, stability, soldiers as Indians had developed Dams, Canals, irrigation system, so Indra became minor concern. Here the mention of a Supreme Being is first described in India as Narayana, in the Vedas, in the Narayana Sukta. Rest is just addition from various Sects.

A spin-grav station is not exactly like a regular space station, only spinning. A regular zero-g station has close to zero structural forces placed on it (other than unrelated forces like pressurization, or some rather special case forces like tidal forces which we can ignore). This means that all you need to do to keep the station together is have juuust enough structural integrity to keep the station from floating apart or collapsing under its own minuscule gravity. You could pretty easily build mountain sized zero-g stations with little concern for structural integrity. I mean, dental floss and toothpicks may not suffice fora station that big, but even poor quality aluminum girders only kinda-sorta bolted together should work fine. Just don’t spin it. The moment you start spinning the station all kinds of other forces come into play, and those forces will not play nice with un-engineered structures. A spinning station is almost exactly like a bridge, with the span equal to the circumference and the load equal to the gravity created by the spin. Take a rocky asteroid a mile in circumference, hollow it out and spin it up to one G? You now have the equivalent of a mile long rock bridge on the surface of the earth with zero support. That is probably not going to work. Even tethering it to itself from the inside (presumably across the diameter) still only gets you the equivalent of a rock suspension bridge a mile long, supported by whatever material your cables are made of. That seems a bit more feasible provided you have a cable every few feet or so, but that is going to play hell with your usable internal space if nothing else. And due to the dynamics of floating in space, you do not even get to cheat and build a super crazy mountain scale stone arch bridge. The only bridge types that will work here are tension style bridges. That is, you can only work with spans, you have no piles, pillars, abutments or piers, or anything else that can transfer forces “down” in compression. Stone, of any kind, sounds really ill suited to this application, and that is even before we get to the fact that most asteroids are more akin to a pile of gravel than a solid stone mountain. What we need are materials that are good under tension, as pretty much every force we are subjecting a spin-grav station to is trying to pull it apart, not squish it together. So now that we know all this, does a spin-grav station where an asteroid is the primary structural component still sound like a more feasible idea than an equivalent fully engineered station? This is a test! Answers below."},{"prompt":"When will the iPhone 12 launch in India?","completion":"iPhone 12 was launched globally on October 16th, 2020.

I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"5 Good tips For New Dancing Do you wish to begin dancing? Here are five beginning dance advices to get you started. Learn various dancing styles If you decide to learn to dance, you might not know which style to pick because there are so many different types of dance. The simplest solution is to experiment with a variety of dancing forms. It's true that mastering one style of dancing takes years of practice, but mastering numerous styles of dancing may be more advantageous and take less time. Instead of concentrating on one style, take the time to learn a little bit about a few different ones. You can find yourself dancing to anything from break dance to ballroom at a range of events. Learn your rhythm while listening to the music. People dance because a beat or rhythm moves them to do so. A [LINKED_TEXT: dance] [URL: https://www.borgwardstudiosinternational.com/] may begin in its simplest form as a foot tap to a captivating rhythm, but by adding more movement, it develops into a dance. You must be able to feel the music and convey that sensation via your body to be a good dancer. It is crucial for a new dancer to get accustomed to the rhythm, so obtain some music that is appropriate for your preferred dancing style and listen to it whenever you can. To boost your confidence, practise a few simple movements in the privacy and comfort of your own house. While dancing, keep your gaze upward. Staring at your own feet while learning a new dance is a common mistake committed by inexperienced dancers. Although the desire to do this is quite normal, it should be avoided. Instead of being about looking, dancing is about feeling. Instead of focusing on your feet, try to concentrate on how the steps feel, letting the shifting of your weight and changes in direction sink in so that you can recall the dance's basic patterns. If you're dancing with a partner, attempt to feel your partner's basic dance moves and pay attention to them. Dancing with various partners When you first start dancing, it's only natural to want to dance with a partner or a buddy. This leads to some comfort but also staleness. Try dancing with a variety of people, particularly when you are first learning the dance, since their various interpretations of the music will help you approach the dance in fresh ways. While you might be worried about dancing with someone who is significantly more skilled than you are or that they have \\"two left feet,\\" dancing with someone else is an opportunity to practise being either a thoughtful leader or a responsible follower. Make each dance a chance for you or your partner to learn something new. Enjoy dancing while remaining calm. Keep in mind that [LINKED_TEXT: dancing] [URL: https://www.borgwardstudiosinternational.com/] should be enjoyable rather than something to get worked up over. Don't worry; dancing is designed to assist lower, not raise, your blood pressure.

If you become so controlling of your child that you don’t allow them to make mistakes, they will only later on make the mistakes that you sheltered them from without proper guidance. And they won’t know how to handle it either, especially when they end up getting arrested or worse. I’m not saying let us be out of control animals with no respect for authority or the law. But don’t trap us in your inner sphere and not let us do anything for our “protection” or “well-being” either. And no, real mistakes aren’t getting a C on a test instead of an A, or getting your lines wrong in the school play. I mean going out and getting into trouble. Let us go to a friend’s house and raid their parents’ liquor cabinet, only to force us to go to school the next day with a hangover. Let us go out with the bad boy and get our hearts broken. Let us explore different parts of the city and get into shenanigans with our friends. Let us dye our hair green or purple while we’re young and unemployed. Let us make mistakes. Let us do stupid shit, even if you need to discipline us later for it. Let us realize that our actions have consequences before we step out into the real world and learn for ourselves. Let us be human and make mistakes.

Recycling your smartphone is an environmentally responsible thing to do, and it can also benefit you in a number of ways. Here are some of the reasons why recycling your old smartphone is a good idea. Reduce e-waste Smartphones, like all electronic devices, contain a variety of materials that can be harmful to the environment if they are not disposed of properly. Recycling your old smartphone ensures that these materials are reused or disposed of in a safe and environmentally responsible way, reducing the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills. Conserve resources By recycling your old smartphone, you are also helping to conserve valuable resources. Many of the materials used to make smartphones, such as copper, silver, and gold, are non-renewable resources that are becoming increasingly scarce. By recycling your old smartphone, you are helping to reduce the demand for these resources and preserve them for future generations. Protect your personal information Your smartphone contains a lot of personal information, including your contacts, emails, and other sensitive data. If you simply throw your old phone away, this information could potentially be accessed by someone else. Recycling your old smartphone ensures that your personal information is securely wiped from the device before it is reused or recycled. If your smartphone is no longer functional or is too old to be useful, recycling it is the best option. Many electronics retailers and recycling centers accept old smartphones for recycling. Be sure to check with your local recycling center to see if they accept smartphones and what their specific requirements are. [LINKED_TEXT: Recycling of mobile phones] [URL: https://www.everythingmobilelimited.com/mobile-phone-recycling/] is a simple but important way to reduce e-waste, conserve resources, and protect your personal information. By trading in, donating, or recycling your old phone, you can ensure that it is disposed of in an environmentally responsible way while also benefiting yourself or others."},{"prompt":"Alexandria OcasioCortez said Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week. What do you think about this?","completion":"I wonder if she said ‘than any 18–25 yo black male’ it would be as acceptable. The way we “allow” ourselves to be prejudiced against men in ways that are totally unacceptable to do/be against blacks is astonishing. We have millions of powerful male executives, most of them making the world a better place to live and providing jobs. A small percentage of them are rapists. Just like a small percentage of young black males are. Somehow though we find it ok with men, to the point we actually need hashtags e.g. #notallmen. And God forbid some many pushes back against the sexism/prejudice he gets shouted down by women. Imagine some black male objecting to a “I’d feel safer with a trans person walking around my store unattended then a young black male” and being #notallblacks silenced? Do we have a Good Blacks Project? Do we tell our black friends who don’t rob or go on welfare “you are one of the good ones”? With blacks we (well most of us) wouldn’t consider saying this and if we did we’d get our asses handed to us. Yet if we do this with some guy “you are one of the good ones” he feels validated versus insulted. We lecture people about crossing the street just because we see a black person walking to or behind us as being racist in the assumption they are likely to mug us, yet we enjoin men to cross the street when they are walking towards or behind a woman because SHE may assume HE is a mugger/rapist.a It is time to stop allowing this kind of misandry and prejudice to continue, and I’d encourage anyone who starts to make some offhand remark to first see what happens if you replace the women with a white person and the man with a black person. Unacceptable misandry AOC and unacceptable lack of acknowledgement of the contributions of powerful male executives."},{"prompt":"What's better, Alibaba or Amazon?","completion":"Neither"},{"prompt":"it worth buying a (new) Herman Miller Aeron chair?

When I had delivered my Son(Avyaan), my mom told me a secret that worked wonders for her & that was to whisper in your child’s ear when they are sleeping. You could whisper anything you wanted, like if you were going out of the house when your child is asleep, then you could whisper in their ears, ” keep sleeping till Mumma is back home”. I also did it many times since Avyaan was small & it worked just the way it was said. This made me quite inquisitive & I wanted to know what this is actually. So after a lot of research & reading, I came to know that this is called “Sleep Talking” & it works like “Magic”. So what is “Sleep Talking”? Over here, you talk to your child’s subconscious mind. Once your child has slept, after 45 mins you go to your child & talk to him/ her just as how you would talk to him when he/ she was awake( conscious mind). When to use this method? You can do this process every single day for anything & everything. This is mainly used when there are some behavioral issues in the child. For instance, your child doesn’t eat food, throws tantrums, bites nails, sucks his thumb, bangs his head, pushes/ hits people, etc. It can also help with things like separation anxiety, school refusal, frustrations or tantrum type behavior, negative self-talk, fears, and phobias or sleep issues – anything that causes stress or anxiety. What to talk about? Talk only positive sentences to your child. For instance, if there is any behavioral issue, like in my case, my son use to not eat green vegetables & he use to bang his head anywhere when he use to get angry. So I started talking to his subconscious mind by saying, Avyaan, you love eating green vegetables.You feel incomplete without green vegetables in a dayGreen Vegetables make us strong.You eat all kinds of green vegetables.Avyaan takes care of himself & all his body parts. ( This one is for him banging his head)You know to control your anger.You know what is right & what is wrong.You are well behaved. In my above sentences, I have not used any negative connotations like don’t, no, not, shouldn’t words. Talk only those sentences that you want your child to be like & always in the present tense. As though he/ she is already behaving well or just the way you wanted them to. At what age can we start this? Right from the time your child is born till 14 years of age. Its impact? Your words work like magic as the subconscious mind is listening to what you are saying & passing the same signal to your child’s body. In my case, Avyaan has now started trying all kinds of vegetables & his headbanging is considerably less as compared to before. You will see the magic unveil with regular practice. Why does this work? After 45 mins of your child being asleep, his subconscious mind becomes completely active & they hear us calmly as well as act immediately upon it. It gives your child a feeling of being loved & secured. .So now it’s become a kind of ritual for me to talk to my son every night after 45 mins of him going to bed. I talk about all kinds of positive affirmations I want to imbibe in my child, as well as any behavioral change that I want to bring in him. I really hope this article was helpful for you all & you too can imbibe this ritual in yours as well as your child’s life on a daily basis. Let us all experience the magic. You can also watch-"},{"prompt":"Why has India ended up as such a corrupt country, while the USA, being another democratic country, has such an organized and lawabiding government in comparison with India?","completion":"The premise of the question.is that US is not corrupt.

My Chinese ancestors lived 400 years ago and my black ancestor lived 500 years ago. That I have Oriental ancestors was no surprise since my sister and I always have speculated that we had Mongol or Tartar ancestors. These peoples are Central Asian but Chinese are Far East Asian. 400 years ago, there was a Jewish community in the city of Kai Feng which was China’s capital at the time. The Jewish community of China disappeared sometime during the 19th century but has re-emerged in this century in Kai Feng. 500 years ago, my ancestor came from the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. They are called Nilotic Africans because they live in the area where the Nile River begins its northwards course. It is possible that my black ancestor was Jewish but not certain. It is also possible that that ancestor came to Europe and was converted to Judaism. Also can’t be certain now. I understand what being part Chinese and part African are about. But what does 98% Jewish mean? The people called Jews today are descended from a variety of different ethnic groups, including original Semitic Israelites. Telling me that I am 98% Jewish tells me very little about my complete genetic history. I am an Ashkenazic Jew. Ashkenazic Jews are descended from Jewish slaves that the Romans took away from Israel and sold to their fellow ethnic brothers. From Rome, they emigrated upwards into northern Italy and then into Provence. In the 10th century, these Jews began to move into German speaking territories where they lived until the early 16th century when they were invited to move to Poland by the Polish royalty. Many then German speaking Jews did move to Poland. Over the course of history, large areas of Poland were swallowed up by what is now Russia. Most Ashkenazic Jews in the west descend from these Polish and Russian Jews. But in their travels, from Rome to Russia, the Jewish People picked up converts from among the peoples with whom they lived. So saying that I am 98% Jewish does not tell me what that means in terms of DNA. It only tells me that I belong to a people contemporaneous with recorded history, going back 6000 years to Sumer from where the original Hebrews originated."},{"prompt":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

Such an action would violate basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to own property and the right to freedom of thought and expression. Additionally, it is not an effective or ethical way to address concerns about gun ownership. Instead, a more productive approach to addressing concerns about gun ownership would be to promote responsible and safe gun ownership practices through education and training programs. This can help ensure that gun owners and their families are aware of the potential dangers of firearms and are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use them safely. It is important to remember that gun ownership is a complex issue that requires thoughtful and nuanced consideration. Any efforts to address this issue should be rooted in respect for individual rights and freedoms, as well as a commitment to promoting public safety and well-being.

Lawyers aren't just useful for arguements, they're able to spot process errors. Instead of arguing the case, they can get it disqualified, thus saving time, money and your ass in the process. My advice would be to see a Lawyer and have a practice case, from there you can test and refine your strategies."},{"prompt":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","completion":"We are not friends but not even enemies, not yet!Quora is too good for gaining knowledge but so poor in chatting.This question helped me to know your name otherwise I don't know even your name so we are strangers for each other.Quora is an upcoming Instagram.

I have literally stopped watching Indian news channel now as whenever I used to switch to any Indian news channel, they were always busy with giving their own verdict in every piece of news which looked more like brainwashing rather than a piece of news to me.

Then there was Abraham of Ur the man that Judaism, Christianity and Islam all trace their roots to and who inspired so much thought for thousands of years."},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"The biggest benefit of leasing a car rather than buying is that you can usually get more car for your money by leasing. A lease involves paying the depreciation on the car rather than the entire purchase price. Leasing also benefits drivers who don't have much money saved up for a down payment.Vehicle leasing Abu Dhabi or anywhere else in U.A.E is a good idea, if you are not a permanent resident of U.A.E. There's also the obvious benefit of leasing: You get a new car every few years. If you sign a 5-year loan to purchase a car, you'll be making payments for the next five years, and if you want out, you'll have to sell the car yourself, which can take time, or trade it in for a new model, which can be expensive. If you're leasing a car, your obligation is released as soon as the lease is over, which usually happens every 2 or 3 years, and you'll be free to go get a new model."},{"prompt":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","completion":"No, nobody can ever beat Aamir’s movie PK. He was simply phenomenal and his role was so confusing. Although he was an adult, he saw the new world (earth) with the innocence and honesty of a child’s eyes and I think no movie ever will do a better justice to sensitive topic of religions than PK. Thus, Aamir Khan in the [LINKED_TEXT: World’s Biggest Superster] [URL: http://www.worldsbiggestsuperstar.in/]. Dilwale was a below average movie and PK was one of the highest grossing films when it released.

Aamir khan-From Qayamat se Qayamat tak to Ishq to PK, Aamir has simply been the best.

However, once chosen, his rule was law. Typically, such men were seasoned seamen with more than a little navigation ability. Wouldn't do much good to elect a popular crewman who couldn't find his way back to Port Royal! They also had to be tough in a fight. Others have said that wealth was a pirate's primary goal, but I would disagree. Survival was priority one. Because once you'd turned pirate, there was precious little chance you could return to England (let's say) with a chest full of gold and not be brought before the law. “A merry life, and a short one,” to paraphrase Bartholomew Roberts. I've read that ship's supplies such as tar, caulking material, sailcloth were every bit as valuable as gold to a pirate. Gold doesn't float, and you can't patch a leaking seam in the hull with it while at sea. Rum was also in high demand as sailors of the era were typically alcoholics. They were probably just going to buy rum with their ill-gotten wealth anyway, so might as well cut out the middleman by capturing some. Even if they never got rich, a captain who kept his men supplied with booze and confident that they would live to see another day was a respected one. And if you had money in your pocket to waste at some debauched pirate haven? So much the better."},{"prompt":"Can mantra of goddess Kali and Lalita Tripursundri be chanted one after another at the same time? Can it have any adverse effect?","completion":"First of all understand that there is a difference between Mantra and Stotra. Mantras are not Twinkle twinkle Little star nursery rhymes. You should not chant mantras of any deities specially Devi without Guru Dikshā. Because matras consist Bijaksara which should not be chanted without Guru Dikshā. Even it is said that we should not keep Srì chakra in home because there is separate rules and regulations are there to worship Yantras and Chakra. It's not my opinion but this is said by Sri Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swami. You can chant stotram of any Deity without Dikshā because here you are not invoking that Deity but you just glorifying them( Stuti ). For daily worship better choose Stotram and chalisa of God/Goddess. If you really want to please Divine Mother recite her Ashtottara shatanamavali , Sahasranama and chalisa. This is more than enough for a Grihastha.

However, some people are hesitant to use them due to concerns about potential health risks associated with microwave-cooked food. Here's a breakdown of some common myths and facts surrounding microwaved food and your health: 1. Myth: Microwaving food destroys nutrients. Fact: Microwaving food is actually one of the best cooking methods for retaining nutrients. Because microwaving cooks food quickly and at a low temperature, fewer nutrients are lost during the cooking process compared to other methods. 2. Myth: Microwaving plastic containers can release harmful chemicals into your food. Fact: While some plastics can release harmful chemicals when heated, most microwave-safe containers are made of materials that won't leach chemicals into your food. To be safe, always use containers labeled as microwave-safe, and avoid using containers that are cracked or damaged. 3. Myth: Microwaved food can cause cancer. Fact: There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Microwave radiation is a type of non-ionizing radiation that doesn't have enough energy to damage your DNA or cause cancer. 4. Myth: Microwaving food can create harmful radiation. Fact: Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, but they are non-ionizing and cannot cause cancer or other harmful effects. Additionally, microwaves are only produced when the microwave oven is turned on and stop immediately when the oven is turned off. In summary, microwaving food is generally safe and can actually be a healthy cooking option. As with any cooking method, it's important to use safe containers and follow best practices to avoid potential risks. You Can also Develop your Cooking through more Recipes.

However, don’t make the rookie mistake of assuming that because those compositions can be played by anyone without having to pay anyone anything, that therefore recordings of those compositions are also in the public domain. Recordings are different. If you want to use a recording of a work by a composer from that era, you have to find out if the recording is in the public domain. Chances are, it won’t be. This means that you will have to pay for the rights to use the recording. If you don’t want to do that, you can of course record musicians playing that music. But you’d better pay them, and sort out the rights in the recording that you make of them playing it. Unless, that is, you can play it yourself, from the sheet music, in which case the rights are between you the producer and you the performer. Then again, some texts of the music of these composers may not be in the public domain. It then depends on what edition you’re using. This is not usually a problem with most works, because the differences between one text and another will likely be inaudible to most listeners. But the main point is this: the actual music of composers from the eras of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc. is in the public domain. But that doesn’t mean you can use any recording of it for free. If you find this situation confusing, say so in the comments and further enlightenment will be provided."},{"prompt":"What are the most beautiful gardens in the world?","completion":"There are many breathtaking gardens around the world that are considered to be among the most beautiful.

Why or why not?","completion":"When “reality” is talked about, yes, it is dualistic! The very reason that “reality” exists is because of duality or existence of remoteness, take it away and you have no reality. Ask yourself this: “If you were not able to observe something (anything) external to you, would you know that you exist?” The instant an “I” exists, the remote “you or her or he or she or it” also exists. It is a pair that occurs together or not at all! Without a remoteness, “I” cannot be recognised or exist. “I” always exists in relation to something else. That is the “Parabrahma tattvam” or “the concept of remote creation”. Take away that “remote” from all your thoughts and try to think of something, you will find there is no thoughts that can occur! The instant you think “I am this body” which seems totally non-dualistic, you find it is not true. You have duality even in this statement. The “I” has been distinctly identified as different from “the body”, then you have two, “I” and the “body”."},{"prompt":"What is your biggest fear in your hostel life?","completion":"My hostel life fears are: * How should I keep my food safe from hungry greedy eyes of 33 other boys with whom I am going to spend most memorable 5 and half years of my life ❗️ * The thought that I am sleeping with some real bones send a chill done my spine 😱❗️ * When I am alone in my room at night the smell of formalin mixed with fat suddenly comes to my olfactory receptors, my sympathetic system gets activated and that fat lady ( not from Harry Potter ) comes in my mind ❗️😨 * A knock at my door as soon as I want to get to sleep, because I know this would ruin my next 1 hours 😭❗️ This is what happens * Next biggest fear is birthday celebration at midnight 🎁‼..."},{"prompt":"Atheists, take a look around.

These tools contribute to improved financial asset performance by increasing engagement and transparency, fostering collaboration, and fostering increased engagement and transparency. Financial advisors may use digital wealth management to build seamless client experiences across all devices and platforms, allowing them to scale solutions to reach a larger number of customers. High-touch consulting has always been an important component of the advisor-client relationship; however, in the digital era, clients need financial advisers to quickly learn about their requirements, preferences, and objectives to deliver personalized financial advice. The financial services industry's digitization allows companies to share data-driven insights with advisers, encouraging engagement and strengthening partnerships. When it comes to leveraging digital technologies to communicate with clients, wealth management organizations encounter a shared set of issues, many of which are related to data collection. Most businesses' client contacts are defined by a large amount of data that is often fragmented and dispersed throughout the organization. It's also more difficult to give tailored insights and relevant services due to a lack of third-party data (on spending and saving habits, values, and interests, as well as related transactional data). Data-driven insights and the ability to engage in cross-channel strategic messaging are two benefits of connecting businesses with automated marketing tools and technologies. Fintech companies are providing new capabilities and techniques to empower technology and expertise to improve customer engagement and corporate performance. The primary drivers of digital change in wealth management are listed below: Switch to digital: According to numerous surveys, 40% of modern investors desire digital access to their accounts, and 80% prefer to manage their investments and contact advisors using mobile applications.Costs and fee pressure: Transparency about fees and compensation puts downward pressure on fees, but the massive assault of regulatory requirements drives up expenses in the traditional business model.Competition: Digital wealth management firms are challenging the traditional wealth management model by providing more personalized and efficient digital experiences that align with shifting customer expectations.Technology: Through mobile interaction, analytics, and service delivery, technology allows innovative capabilities. It provides a consistent context for interactions across channels that may be automated, as well as enhanced access to data sources that are otherwise inaccessible to make routine process decisions."},{"prompt":"Should Rs 3,000 crore be spent to build Ram Mandir?","completion":"Some facts: Ayodhya temple is being built using donations collected from devotees, not taxpayers' funds. This is also true for a majority of other temples. Other public facilities are also important, but they are supposed to be built from tax money. Money collected for temple construction cannot be legally used for anything else. Unlike some other religious structures, temples pay huge amounts of taxes every year. Temples strengthen will power of those who believe in God, especially in bad phases of life. I myself do not visit temples, but believe that they should be approachable to common people.

You're not alone. I understand the frustration and discomfort it can cause, and I'm here to provide some tips that can help you find relief and get back to enjoying life pain-free. Living with back pain can be incredibly challenging, but there are steps you can take to alleviate your discomfort and regain control over your well-being. Let's explore some effective approaches: Take care of your posture: Poor posture can contribute to back pain and hinder your progress toward recovery. By improving your posture, you can alleviate strain on your back and promote overall spinal health. Be mindful of your posture when sitting, standing, and lifting. Keep your spine aligned, and shoulders relaxed, and avoid slouching. Consider incorporating ergonomic adjustments into your daily activities, such as using a supportive chair or adjusting your workstation setup.Engage in targeted exercises and physical therapy: Exercise is a powerful tool for managing lower back pain. Engaging in targeted exercises and physical therapy can work wonders in strengthening the muscles supporting your spine, improving flexibility, and reducing pain.Discover the therapeutic benefits of heat or cold therapy: Applying heat or cold packs to your back can provide soothing relief and help alleviate discomfort. Experiment with both options to see which works best for you. Heat therapy, such as using a heating pad or taking a warm bath, can help relax muscles and increase blood flow to the area. Cold therapy, like using ice packs or cold compresses, can reduce inflammation and numb the area. Listen to your body and choose the option that brings you the most relief. Remember to use a barrier (such as a towel) between the heat or cold pack and your skin to prevent burns or frostbite.Prioritize relaxation and stress management: Stress and tension often exacerbate back pain. It's essential to prioritize relaxation and stress management techniques in your daily routine. Explore relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation. These practices can help you unwind, reduce muscle tension, and promote overall well-being. Additionally, consider incorporating gentle stretching exercises, such as yoga or tai chi, into your routine to improve flexibility and release muscle tension.Enhance your sleep for optimal healing: Restful sleep is crucial for your body's healing process. Make sure you prioritize sleep and optimize your sleep environment. Choose a supportive mattress and pillow that align with your comfort needs. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can strain your back. Instead, sleep on your back or side with a pillow between your knees for added support. Establish a bedtime routine that promotes relaxation, such as avoiding electronic devices before bed, creating a calm sleep environment, and practicing good sleep hygiene habits. You'll wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day without the burden of back pain.Achieve holistic wellness through lifestyle adjustments: Your overall well-being plays a significant role in managing back pain. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, you can support your back and improve your overall quality of life. Consider these lifestyle adjustments: Balanced diet: Eat a nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Adequate nutrition supports the body's healing processes and promotes overall health. Regular exercise: In addition to targeted exercises for your back, engage in regular physical activity to strengthen your overall body. Choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, to improve cardiovascular health and promote overall well-being. Stress reduction practices: Chronic stress can contribute to back pain. Incorporate stress reduction practices into your daily routine, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight puts additional strain on your back and can worsen back pain. Maintain a healthy weight through a combination of regular exercise and a balanced diet.Avoid smoking: Smoking can impair blood flow and decrease the body's ability to heal, which may contribute to back pain. Quitting smoking can improve overall health and aid in the management of back pain. In addition to these strategies, certain supplements may help support your efforts in managing lower back pain. Omega-3 fatty acids: Found in fish oil and certain plant-based sources, omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain in the lower back.Turmeric: Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It may help reduce inflammation and provide relief from lower back pain.Vitamin D: Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, including lower back pain. Getting adequate sunlight exposure and consuming vitamin D-rich foods may be beneficial. In some cases, healthcare professionals may recommend vitamin D supplementation to address deficiencies.Magnesium: Magnesium plays a vital role in muscle relaxation and may help alleviate muscle spasms associated with lower back pain. Adequate magnesium levels can be maintained through a balanced diet that includes foods like nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and whole grains. In cases of deficiency, magnesium supplements may be considered under professional guidance.I think all these tips will help you with your lower back pain.

This leads to some extra time in night to relax too. The working pattern over here is as 5 days of week as working days and two days as weekends to get a proper rest.

Every ‘c’ in Pacific Ocean is pronounced differently: The first one sounds like an ‘s’, the second one sounds like a hard ‘ck’, and the third one sounds like a ‘sh’. 2. Black apples exist: They are called Black Diamond apples and they are found in Tibet. They are actually a very dark shade of purple and they look like regular Red Delicious apples inside. 3. Butt-shaped robots are used to test phones: Samsung uses these robots to simulate how people sit on their phones in their back pockets. They want to make sure their products are durable and bendable. 4. There are now giant pigs as heavy as polar bears: In China, some farmers are breeding huge swine that can weigh up to 1,102 pounds, which is about the same as an adult male polar bear. These pigs are sold for meat and can bring in a lot of money. 5. Anne Frank and Martin Luther King, Jr. were born the same year: They both came into the world in 1929, but they lived very different lives and became symbols of different historical events.

She went to get plastic surgery, getting a breast reduction and found her performance immediately improved.

There's no counting calories or worrying about whether you're eating too much or too little. The foods you'll eat on this 14-day plan will keep you naturally satiated by stabilizing your blood sugar, filling your belly, and keep your hunger hormones under control. When I began the Zero Sugar Diet, and saw for myself how quickly and effectively it stripped off the pounds, I realized that eating according to this plan was changing my body in ways I never imagined possible. And I found that once I got used to reading labels a bit more carefully, I learned how much I had been sabotaging my own weight-loss goals with foods that were low in calories but that were bombarding me with added sugars. You'll find that, too. Also with the help of this product aside from healthy diet it really works for me so I really recommend this product too!

Only the reformed souls are resurrected to jannah / paradise , the rest keep coming back to this planet , in the form of rebirth, for reformation. Our next lives on this planet will be made heaven - like if we follow God's laws, do a lot of good deeds in this life , stay away from bad deeds .

As with any research oriented assignment, I would say starting as early as possible is there best thing to do. Don't waste time to start identifying potential sources. If you don't really have a topic, that process needs to get done quick. You don't have to boil the topic or area down to a specific title yet, just have a general direction and start getting some reading done. As you read and collect information and data, always be thinking ahead. Be considering your next question. Research is intended to answer questions — particularly new questions. What we really want to do is to get to the right questions because the right questions give us the right answers. Sometimes you'll have to sift through some wrong questions, but that's okay. As long as your philosophy is founded in looking and thinking ahead, you'll likely come up with a direction quickly to get a new question. As a side note, don't get too worried if results or data weren't what you expected. Scientific truth is found whether an experiment succeeds or fails. Failure teaches us what doesn't work and that is every bit as important to the scientific process as finding what does work. Try to have a good time with it. You will likely get very tired of the topic and primary research question as you progress. I know a person that did some incredible research on the medicinal and antimicrobial properties of honey. A year's of extremely solid and diligent work. She wouldn't even hardly eat honey at the end. 😂 Just try your best to keep in perspective what you enjoy about the topic and learning. Only thing to follow up off that last point is to make sure you take good breaks from your work. Make sure you take time off. Give yourself your weekends. It's hard to do. But, when you are leaving on a Friday that was crazy and gave you ridiculous results or data, remind yourself that the data will be there for you on Monday to figure out. It's okay to not think about your research now and that will make you a better researcher in the long run."},{"prompt":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","completion":"Here are some of the best cars under 10 lakhs in India: Maruti Suzuki Brezza: The Brezza is a popular choice for buyers looking for a stylish and affordable SUV.

But as to my office, which has relatively lesser no of employees compared to other cities of India, whatever happening here is outward stupidity. EY is a good name on your resume on the positive side. On the negative side, if you fall into the wrong side of the picture owing to the factors like location, office, the leadership of the location, service line, you could end up in total mess. Associates with 2–3 yrs of experience seems to have more common sense than the leadership. EY introduced certain apparent cost cutting measures that is again, stupid! Employees don't have enough space (desk, chair) on the office floor. Cost cutting over that ? Tools and technologies are supposed to benefit people and make life easier. Here in EY, tools makes lives difficult. EY has not even heard of words like professionalism, efficiency or productivity.

I think there is a lot of truth to it. If you ask me, I think if you don’t do the repairs yourself, you should at least know what was broken and what it takes to get things back in order. In America, not everything is license required. Knowing what’s involve and costs for the repair usually helps to determine whether you should DIY or call for help. If you are in a habit of just calling for contractors, the maintenance costs could eaten you alive and there goes the budget. Number one trouble calls you will get are plumbing related. Drains clogged, leaks, faucet(s) not operating, water heater not functioning… You will find that most drains clogged were hair, hair, and hair. Buy a bunch of drain screens from the 99 cent store and give it to the tenant, that would save you a lot of unnecessary frustrating calls. Also Harbor Freight Tools or Amazon, this cheap drain snake gadget comes in handy. [LINKED_TEXT: 7 Pack Drain Snake, Kungix Drain Clog Remover Clogged Drain Hair Remover Zipit Drain Cleaning Tool - - Amazon.com] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/Drain-Kungix-Remover-Clogged-Cleaning/dp/B07FTDS3CJ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1549294764&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=drain%20clog%20remover&psc=1] Most leaks were just things got loose. Learned the wonders of Teflon tape and how to tighten things with pipe wrench would do magics. Faucets are easy to replace providing you are not afraid to get under the sink. I have replaced many water heaters myself because of the high costs of labor and it’s not that hard. That’s the one chore you need help because of the weight f the water heater. I was a teacher before I came to the US and know nothing about repairing things. In Vietnam, Hong Kong, or Thailand. In fact, pretty much all over Asia, people rely on tradesman and specialists when things breakdown. However, in the USA, I learned and found out I can do everything myself. My ex and I often said Home Depot and Lowes were the most romantic places for all who believes in DIY (Do It Yourself). Want to be self reliant, America is the place. Youtube is your best teacher where you can even learn how to build a house let alone just minor repairs. Most of the time, I found that I can do a much better job than people who claimed to be professionals. There are too many unscrupulous contractors out there whose main goal was to gouge or prey on people who can’t assess the extend of the repairs. Being a property manager for 30 rental properties, troubles are always looming no matter what day it is. Also as a realtor, I got in a habit of doing many minor repairs for my seller(s) or to make buyer(s) happy when both sides are not budging on repair items. Labor is expensive in America, average plumber with charge you 75 per hour plus parts. Electricians the same. So there goes a hundred dollars for every call. There is not a one size fits all for all situations. Finding an honest and good contractor is like finding a needle in a haystack. If you found one, treasure him/her. Know thy limits and call for the experts. Don’t get mad when SHIT happens. It’s life. Ask the tenant to shoot you a video. Then go online to find answers and go check out the problem before calling anybody. That’s what I do. You will find out so much about yourself and what you are capable of doing. I used to do everything myself before I hit 65, now i’m very selective of what I want to do. I have a team of contractors who I rely on to get things done whenever needed."},{"prompt":"What’s your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","completion":"Whatever you do in life do it for yourself, don't take the pressure of doing anything for parents it will automatically make them happy if u try to give your 100% , try to become independent, don't rush in emotionally for someone you should wait and explore more for the best , even if you fall for someone wrong it's ok move on and focus on yourself and stop thinking that you only love once , I won't love again etc . , this is all bullshit , stop it and focus on your career and next time as I said don't rush explore and use your brain too before choosing anyone , don't let your dreams go because of someone else , have confidence on yourself , make your standards higher . Don't let your insecurities control your mind , let go of the factors in life you can't control , live to the fullest potential, stop letting social media your daily routine , don't check the phone everything it beeps , control yourself , and atlast I want to say i dotn want any girl to be a housewife there is nothing wrong in that but the respect which a working women gets in the society is more than a housewife ,not a lie its truth and you cant deny it , so never give up literally even if you are doomed and when have nothing left you have hope so don't give up till the last breathe of your life."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"No, I’m not upset.

The EU say Novavax is dragging it’s heels. Novavax say they are wary, following the AZ vaccine program. Who is telling the truth?","completion":"The truth is pretty much irrelevant. Historic facts (as we know them) are the EU has raided factories, has taken actions likely to cause violent conflict and breach international anti-war treaties and further to override contract vs semi-nationalisation. This is after backing out of contracts to try and lowball people who were already making nothing during a global pandemic. It then libeled the producers of the vaccines they apparently wanted but didn’t but did then didn’t (where are we now)? Novovax being wary is not exactly surprising. If I were them I’d just tell them to get fucked and refuse to sell to them at all (really), especially anything they are not making in the EU. Litigation and general grief, just sell elsewhere and let the EU buy from oversupplied 3rd party if they so wish.

Fondly called as The Last Kiss, the image represents love in the time of world war. Sweet, but NO. These are not soldiers giving their last kisses to their lovers. World War II ended in 1945. The women's hairstyle look more close to beehive, a style which only popularized in the 60′s. WWII women are styled in curls and rolls and are generally short and are kept due to the type of work available to women that time — fields, factories, and armed forces. The second woman from the bottom has a Brownie Hawkeye camera which was only manufactured by 1949 — 4 years after the war. So what is the picture about? The ship is the Amerigo Vespucci —a naval ship used to train the Naval Academy Cadets. The location of this scene is in Egypt.

I have been in Qatar for a while now. It’s quite the opposite here! Almost all the government offices, public service units/company and other government-affiliated entities start their official working hours from 7–7:30 o’clock in the morning. I also have 7:30 am - 4 pm shift timing. There is a substantial number of people who actually wake up way earlier in the morning around the Fajr Prayer time and start their day very early. Nobody sleeps here in the morning, man. Even many shops open up between 5–7 am while others around 8–9 am. Same work culture and routine is there in the UAE, Kuwait & Bahrain (I have some friends, relatives and acquaintances over there, so I can tell). It might be slightly different in Oman and Saudi Arabia though but not very significant. Now, people who are super rich or who don’t have their work routine like teenagers or school/college goers, they might be sleeping late in the morning or till afternoon, just like in any other part of the world. So, it’s really about the social strata and the age group they belong to. I hope this answers your query. Thank you!"},{"prompt":"Where do you find the crowd for crowdfunding campaigns?","completion":"You can find the crowd in many places. But that’s part of the problem. I bet you could sit down for 5 minutes and list out 20 different possible places you could find backers for your campaign. But trying to market to 20 different sources is not an efficient use of your time. You need to prioritize where you will be most effective. To do this, let’s break down the top sources of traffic to highly funded Kickstarter & Indiegogo campaigns. For fun, I’ll also throw in some other traffic sources that can also be effective. TOP 4 SOURCES Let’s start with the top 4 sources to highly funded campaigns. For fun, I like to call these the Four Horseman of Crowdfunding. The First Horseman: Pre-Launch Community You build your Pre-Launch Community before your campaign launches. It is a list of people that are interested in purchasing your product once your campaign launches. There are many different ways to build a Pre-Launch Email List, but my favorite is through Facebook Advertising. This Horseman leads the charge. On average, we find that around 90% of the sales from the Pre-Launch Email List will come within the first 48 hours. The goal of the Pre-Launch Email List is to drive sales immediately to your campaign once you launch. Ideally, the traffic from this Horseman alone will be enough to get your campaign funded. Learn more about Facebook Advertising and email marketing [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://learn.launchboom.com/hacking-kickstarter-2-0-24cebb74f281]. The Second Horseman: Facebook Advertising Facebook’s targeting is scary good. So good that other platforms (Google, Twitter, etc.) haven’t even come close to the same return as we’ve seen on Facebook. This is why we tend to spend 100% of our ad budgets on Facebook. Instagram may creep in there sometimes, but it’s owned by Facebook so it still counts as “Facebook Advertising” in my book. This Horseman will fight till the end. The Facebook Advertising Horseman will be with you for the remainder of the campaign after the Pre-Launch Email List has ridden off. Facebook Ads allow you to keep sustained traffic throughout your campaign. Depending on how good the returns are, you can scale up and down as you please. If you are able, I recommend using an agency like [LINKED_TEXT: Jellop] [URL: https://jellopcrowdfunding.com/] during the campaign. The Third Horseman: PR & Media Placement Landing solid PR provides your campaign with two things: (1) Credibility — everyone loves to see the “logo clouds” and quotes from top media. (2) Sales — top tier media placement can put millions of eyeballs on your product which can drive tons of pledges. BaKblade 2.0 got picked up by Business Insider in the last week of the campaign and raised nearly 200K in 4 days. The original video that went viral received 30 million views (yes million), 56 thousand likes, 179,115 shares, and 131 thousand comments! This Horseman fights in waves. Most of the time, the traffic you receive from PR will come in bursts. You’ll get placement on some media site, see a spike in traffic and sales and then see it die down just as fast. Good news is that PR tends to become easier to land with each successful story you get. Some of my favorite agencies to work with are [LINKED_TEXT: Proper Propaganda] [URL: http://properpropaganda.net/] and [LINKED_TEXT: PulpPR] [URL: https://pulppr.com/]. The Fourth Horseman: Kickstarter/Indiegogo’s Community I get the question all the time: “why do you launch on Kickstarter or Indiegogo? Shouldn’t you just launch on your own website so you have more control?” There are many reasons why crowdfunding platforms are the best place to launch your product, but the top reason has never changed — crowdfunding platforms have millions of visitors viewing their website every day. Tap into that traffic and you’ll raise a lot more money. This Horseman never rides alone. If the other three Horsemen don’t show up to the campaign, then this Horseman won’t appear either. Drive sales through your Pre-Launch Email List, Facebook Advertising, and PR and you’ll start to see sales come in from Kickstarter or Indiegogo’s communities. The reason why is because both of the platforms have a ranking system. Generally, the more popular your campaign is, the higher you are in the rankings. Cool fact: Last time I calculated the percentage of sales from Kickstarter across all our campaigns the number came out to 28.3%. That’s a lot of sales! OTHER MARKETING STRATEGIES Here are some other marketing strategies that I’ve seen also seen get more backers. Kickbooster These guys created the first affiliate program for Kickstarter and it’s worked pretty well for us. With it, you can incentivize your backers to share your project by giving them a % of the sales they drive. [LINKED_TEXT: Kickbooster] [URL: https://kickbooster.me/] also has something called their Superbooster network where big news publications like Mashable and Gizmodo will write a story about your product and get paid a portion of the sales they drive. The Gadget Flow Evan and his team have done a great job building this service to give exposure to Kickstarter campaigns. Check out their pricing and see if one of their options would work for you. Cross Promotions Cross promotions are when you reach out to other Kickstarter campaigns that are currently live and offer to promote their campaign. In return, they’ll promote your campaign to their backers. It’s much better to be methodical about your outreach. You’ll want to choose campaigns that: You genuinely think your backers will likeHave similar demographics & interestsHave similar backer counts (don’t reach out to a campaign with 10,000 backers when you have 100. It’s not a fair trade) The usual way to cross promote is to include a link to their campaign in one of your campaign updates and they’ll do the same. Indiegogo InDemand Now we’re getting into post-campaign territory but it’s important to know this is an option. After the campaign is over, you can launch directly onto Indiegogo InDemand. You can think of it as a pre-order store. They will copy your campaign from Kickstarter over instantly and you’ll be up and running in 10 minutes. BackerKit This is also another post-campaign strategy. BackerKit not only makes shipping & fulfillment a breeze, but they also have an extremely effective upsell tool which has always made us money. If you are extra nice, they may even feature you in their newsletter during your campaign. Just reach out early and see if they can help you. — Good luck, -Mark [LINKED_TEXT: Click here] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Pecota] for my most popular Quora answers about Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and entrepreneurship"},{"prompt":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","completion":"Our landlord did just this to keep us. We had been in the house for a couple of lease cycles and we had never been late on the rent, kept the place up nicely, cut down a buckthorn forest and we got along with the neighbors on both sides. We didn’t cause much grief for the landlords and were quite accommodating for maintenance people. I had left my corporate position a bit more than a year before the next lease renewal. We had checked other rentals in the area and were planning to move to a place about 300 month less and mentioned that to the landlords. The landlords then offered us a lease at that same rate for one year only. The landlords had provided a lawn service and fertilizer service for free in previous leases but if we agreed to the reduction, we would need to do our own maintenance. We stayed for three more years after the reduced lease ended."},{"prompt":"What is swing trading?","completion":"This definition would be the one you're looking for [LINKED_TEXT: Swing Trading Definition | Investopedia] [URL: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp]"},{"prompt":"f you could design your own house, what would it be like?","completion":"I designed one based vaguely upon my own family and its history. I took some liberties with the lore (I’ve also only seen the show). HOUSE CLEYE, VASSALS OF HOUSE STARK LOCATED BETWEEN THE NECK AND CAPE KRAKEN The Cleyes have a long but poorly documented history. They have long been fiercely independent, but at the same time swear fealty to the Starks in Winterfell, if only because they see themselves more as Northerners than anything else, and living under the Starks was one of the few ways to protect against encroaching crannogmen and ironborn - their location between the Neck and Cape Kraken ensured that there was no shortage of enemies to the east or west. Their family sigil is a badger, a fierce, independent creature born of the earth, standing rampant upon a shield split in half with red on the bottom and brown on top; the red resembles both blood shed in defense of their lands and the clay that gives them their name and their lives, while the brown represents their earthen walls. They are based out of the castle of Marshall Keep, named after one of their oldest descendants, Marshall Cleye, who fought against the Targaryen invasion, but stood down once the Starks surrendered. Since then, the Cleyes have been tasked with the challenge of keeping watch in several directions for ironborn incursions and invading armies. It is often said that “the Cleyes can’t stop them, but they’ll sure as hell make them work”. This is in reference to the massive fortifications, at least by (man-made) Northern standards, that the Cleyes are fond of building and maintaining. These are huge constructions of clay and stone from which the original Cleyes got their name; their mixed nature ensures that they are reasonably strong while also easy to repair. The best known of their fortifications is Dodger’s Wall, sometimes (both sarcastically and sincerely, depending on who you talk to) called the Great Wall, standing forty feet high in some places and stretching from the western edge of the Neck, all along the southern coast, wrapping back around to almost totally encircle Cleye lands, with several less imposing branches shooting off into Cape Kraken and the Neck. The wall is dotted with numerous castles and towers, but only a handful are actually manned at all times. Rather than sit idly behind their walls and wait out an enemy, the Cleyes use their fortifications as part of an active offense-defense strategy in which they bait and exhaust their enemies, often encircling the foe (with men usually, but in one infamous battle against the ironborn, with an actual hastily constructed wall). However, being made of earth and stone as they are, these walls won’t stop a serious invader for more than a day or two, even shorter for attackers that already have constructed siege engines with them. It could be argued, though, that the walls still serve their purpose perfectly - the Cleyes understand that they aren’t the Lannisters or the Starks, and that they can’t hope to defend their land for long against large forces, and so they make it their mission to be as much of an infuriating nuisance to the enemy as physically possible. The clay that gives the Cleyes their name also extends to the family’s personal philosophy. Like the clay, they are flexible and can be molded to any situation, changing their strategies and doctrines to suit the current situation. However, when crisis and war inevitably come to their doorstep, the fire does not drive them back or harm them - it hardens their resolve and makes them stronger. This concept gives them their motto, “The Crucible’s Bane”. (I had a really hard time coming up with a good motto - if you have a suggestion, go for it.) In the War of the Five Kings, the Cleyes were staunch supporters of the King in the North, and later frustrated the ironborn invaders that ravaged the North, and then led a not-so-discrete resistance against House Bolton. The Boltons, of course, recognized this insurrection, but given the isolated nature of House Cleye, both diplomatically and physically, they determined that it was not worth marching a force through the Neck and against Cleye walls; the Cleyes’ particular brand of frustration was only effective when armies were marching against the North, not from it."},{"prompt":"What are some of the best actual images of real atoms and molecules?","completion":"Depends what you mean by ‘see’.

Why or why not?","completion":"Well …. actually I don't. Why …………because, we human beings have brains and we are good at logic and justification, and when we ourselves, get convinced with that justification, we believe in that. Though I am a Hindu by belief and I know the story of how Dhritrashta, in one of his previous births had poked thorns in the eyes of birds and that was the reason, he was born blind in his birth as Dhritrashta. The story goes like this that on some occasion he asks Lord Krishna the reason for his blindness and Krishna through his mystical powers shows him his previous births, where in he pokes thorns in the eyes of newly born birds. I used to believe in Karma a lot but off late I have started believing that it it doesn't exist. Again mind Lol…I will give you reasons:- Everyone's life is full of ups and downs. There is no person on this earth who has seen only ups or only downs. So when we face downs in life, we try to find a logic and because we keep hearing the law of karma, we immediately try to justify ourselves that we might have done something wrong, somewhere that is why ,we are facing this.Most of the time , when people do something wrong ( as such there is nothing write or wrong but while doing something if you feel guilty then it is wrong for you), and immediately after that something wrong happens to them, they feel it's because of their karma. They feel that because they did this wrong, this has happened to them.Two incidents are actually independent of each other and we try to correlate them. For example : if I deduct my maids salary for she being absent for ten days and suddenly after that my washing machine stops working,it needs a repair and has an expense of RS.4000/- ,I start feeling that because I deducted her pay, I have to pay it somewhere else. Here the point to be noted is , do I have a guilt while deducting my maids pay, if yes then I think it is because of karma. But if I do something in my righteousness and consciousness, I will never have that guilt, no matter what happens after that or how much ever big a loss I bear, I will never feel that it is because of karma. Because I have done it in complete righteousness. Here me deducting my maid's salary and my machine becoming nonfunctional are two incidents, independent of each other.I myself have come across people, when they pay heavy price for their karma , because people act in pattern. For example : There is a manager and he is good entangling people in some or the other wrong deeds and firing them. And he is quite successful at it. But one day, he would definitely come across one such subordinate, who would retort so badly and vehemently that the manager would really pay heavy in terms of his respect and reputation. So when people continuously do something in repeated pattern,that is harming people, someone or the other is going to retort. And I won't call it as karma. Because as per my understanding, law of karma is very subtle. So then what is Karma, it is very subtle that you won't even understand if it works or not. We have various philosophies that explain the law of karma. But I as a normal human being refuse to believe in the law of karma. For if something doesn't happen as per my liking in my life, I would blame it on the law of karma Lol. That I might have done something wrong in some of my previous births and it is because of that I am facing this. I have seen people who have cheated me upfront and coming back to me after years and crying and asking for forgiveness and also requesting me not to curse them and their family. Reason I am sharing this is, they knew in the core of their hearts that they are wrong, they were cheating me and they were guilty. I have already mentioned that if you are guilty, that is one justification for karma. BTW, I never cursed them and just moved ahead the in life. As for me, I have seen a lot of hardships in my life, and I believe in taking charge of them and moving ahead. Because believing in law of karma weakens my belief in myself, I do not want to believe that because I have done something wrong, I am facing this. I basically do not want to believe in any philosophy which weakens my belief in my self. That is the crux."},{"prompt":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","completion":"Yes, it is!

As a melting pot, Canadians consisting of a mixture of many nationalities who, while maintaining their own cultures to some extent thereby enriching the social fabric of Canada, fully embraced the Canadian values forged over its early years resulting in a society where everybody was welcome and accepted and shared the special things that made their original cultures unique. This resulted in an overall reputation of Canadians being friendly, accepting, tolerant and generally polite. In recent years, however, the multicultural ideology that Justin Trudeau’s father started has developed into a strategy where the original immigrants from Europe and Asia have been replaced by third world countries without the effort to integrate them within the culture resulting in enclaves in the larger cities comprised of people with little to no knowledge of Canadian history or established values. Consequently, they are raising families lacking the understanding that the rest of us share in common. Some of these are bordering on hostile to what the previous “polite” generations held dear. So the question remains - will the fragmentation of the Canadian fabric continue, thereby making us a nation at war with itself or will there come some transformational leader on to the scene that will redirect us back to the once “polite” society the world once held in high esteem ?"},{"prompt":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ?

It’s just that some family are functioning healthier compared to others but this will not help your situation. Never compare yourself about anything to anyone.

If you are in the USA, either the Embroidery Guild of America or The American Needlepoint Guild would be great places to start. Many other countries have great guilds too, Canada, Australia, and the UK all have something equivalent. Since I am in the USA any information I give you is specific to the US but I am sure other organizations are similar. Membership is inexpensive, my chapter was 55 in 2017 and sometimes they will sponsor you the first year and membership into a group like this comes with a number of fantastic benefits. First off, you get to be around people who enjoy the same past time that you do. So much of stitching is handed down through generations and being in a group gets you access to tips and tricks that other peoples grandparents showed them. The camaraderie is amazing. I owe so much to the women of my chapter. They don't just encourage me to be a better stitcher. When I was unemployed they helped me find the perfect job. Helped me prep for the interview and shared in my joy when I got it. Secondly, you get access to crazy amounts of free patterns and education materials. There is a quarterly magazine, correspondence courses and even discounts at local craft stores. This year I have had the opportunity to attend two conventions, two retreats, and countless one day classes. Every single one day class I took was put on by my local chapter and was free or close to it. To be fair I did have to pay for the conventions and retreats but, all of them came with classes and kits taught by world class teachers. Third, you get exposed to lots of different types of stitching. When I started I did only American or English style embroidery. 6 years after joining a guild I have had exposure to Cross Stitch Samplers, Beading, Japanse Silk Embroidery, Italian Needle Lace, Casaguidi, Hapsburg Lace, Needle painting, Hardanger, Needlepoint on painted canvas and on counted canvas, Shashiko, and many more. All in guild sponsored one or two day classes that were either free or just the cost of supplies. Finally, you finish way more projects. This does not mean you have less stash or fewer unfinished objects (UFO’s). It just means that when you are working on a group project you are more likely to finish it. Its kind of like having a work out buddy. When other people are invested in what you are working on you are more likely to have help when you need it and more desire to show it off at show and tell. ***EDIT*** I just noticed that the original poster was in the UK. Did you know that the Royal School of Embroidery is in London? It is the only place in the world you can get a degree in stitching. They also have a fantastic museum.

I know of several engineers who went the entrepreneurial way and took risk, created businesses, jobs for many and wealth for themselves.

I am sure most students do not have entrepreneurial ambitions when they start engineering school, and certainly not their parents. But, I think if an engineer can understand risk and build products and services, India is a place where he could have a great probability of success.

Here are some of the methods that can be used to trace a VPN connection: IP address tracking: The IP address assigned to a device by a VPN provider can be used to determine the general location of the device, but it can be difficult to determine the specific identity of the person using the VPN connection. However, it's worth noting that some VPN providers keep logs of the IP addresses assigned to their users, which can be used to trace a VPN connection.Traffic analysis: The traffic generated by a VPN connection can be analyzed to determine the source and destination of the data being transmitted. This can be done by analyzing the characteristics of the data, such as the type and volume of traffic, and cross-referencing it with other information.Malicious software: Malicious software, such as malware or spyware, can be used to monitor and collect information about a VPN connection, including the source and destination of the data being transmitted.Cooperation with ISPs and other organizations: Tracing a VPN connection may also require the cooperation of internet service providers (ISPs) and other organizations, such as law enforcement agencies, that have access to additional information and technical resources. It's worth noting that while VPN connections can be traced, they offer a higher level of privacy and security compared to using the internet without a VPN. However, to ensure the highest level of privacy and security, it's important to choose a reputable and trustworthy VPN provider that has a strong privacy policy and does not keep logs of user activity."},{"prompt":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","completion":"Download the book for free: It Ends with Us [LINKED_TEXT: Open Now] [URL: https://www.yasinzone.com/2023/08/download-book-for-free-it-ends-with-us.html]"},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Prajakta Kohli who achieved a lot during her a short span of career with all her self-confidence.

Pick the right first date spot. When you’re planning a first date, you don’t want to go somewhere too fancy or too loud or someplace you can’t have a conversation (like a movie). The point of a first date is to see how well you connect with each other , so talking and enjoying each other’s company are important here. Your best bet in choosing a first date spot is to go somewhere lighthearted and relaxed. You don’t want to deal with the pressure of a formal restaurant or the chaos of an amusement park for your first meeting. Think sitting down at a coffee shop or grabbing a drink somewhere casual where you can get the conversation going. And if it feels like you and your date are hitting it off, you can take it up a notch by going to dinner that night or suggesting a meetup the next morning for a walk or smoothie date. 2. Date safely. Safety should always be your priority—especially in the online dating scene. It’s so important for both guys and ladies to date with caution. We don’t want to scare you, but remember—you don’t really know the person you’re going out with. To be safe on a first date, meet in a public place where other people can see you. Tell a friend where you’re going and what time you expect to be home. You could even share your location with them so they can check in and see where you are if they haven’t heard from you by a certain time. And unless you already know the person you’re going on a date with really well, don’t share super personal information like your home or work address. We repeat: Do not share your address! Once you establish trust, you can let them pick you up or drop you off at your house. But in the early days, a stranger doesn’t need to know where you live. 3. Dress for confidence and comfort. Okay, we’re going to lighten the mood a bit by answering a really important question: What should you wear on a first date? Well, choosing an outfit you feel comfortable in is always a good idea. But to make a good first impression, you should also put some time and effort into looking nice. Think about the atmosphere and dress code of your first date spot. Ladies, it might not be appropriate to wear those stiletto heels to a coffee date at Starbucks, but flats are always a classic. And gentlemen, swap your sweatpants for a nice pair of jeans and an ironed shirt (and add a blazer if you want to look really snazzy). 4. Relax on your date. Does love feel like a battlefield? Maybe you feel lonely on the inside because you’re still single and don’t want to be, or maybe you have a huge crush on someone and really want it to turn into something more. Just take a deep breath and relax for a moment. Here’s a nugget of wisdom for you: The purpose of a first date isn’t to decide if you want to marry this person—it’s to decide if you want to go on a second date. That’s it! So, try to have fun, and enjoy spending time with and getting to know another human. If you click, that’s great. And if you aren’t feeling it, don’t force it. It’s not the end of the world. The old saying is true . . . there are plenty of other fish in the sea. 5. Give thoughtful compliments. Both guys and girls really appreciate a thoughtful compliment if it’s genuine. Telling your date, “Wow, you look great,” is totally appropriate. But giving too many compliments throughout the date, though, can be a little awkward. So, if you’re worried about coming on too strong, just compliment your date on something other than their appearance—like their laugh, sense of humor, intelligence or great taste in music. 6. Ask good questions. Before your date, come up with a few questions ahead of time so you don’t struggle to think of a conversation starter while you’re sitting across from someone you’ve just met. Instead of the usual get-to-know-you questions (do you really want to explain why blue is your favorite color again?), here are some creative ideas that will help you get to know your date on a deeper level: What’s the last book you read, and what did you think of it?What’s your favorite gift you’ve ever received?What’s something you’ve never tried but always wanted to?What’s your favorite memory with your family?What do you think about budgeting? (Wink, wink.)Do you have any crazy travel stories?What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever gotten?What’s the worst piece of advice you’ve ever gotten?When you feel stressed, how do you relax?What are you really thankful for right now?What would your ideal day look like here is one most suggested site for dating in USA GOFORDESI"},{"prompt":"f you are a medical worker, have you ever experienced a patient full out faking?","completion":"I have had quite a few “Pseudo Seizure\\" vs. Fake seizure patients, over the years. I don't know the statistics on it (or if they exist) but in my experience, they have mostly, if not all been young females. A percentage have a real seizure disorder mixed with the fake or pseudo seizures. A history of abuse was common with the patients that I saw. We had a couple that clearly wanted Midazolam and/or had a benzodiazepines addiction. Most of these had no idea what a seizure should look like or watched too much bad TV. They would just jerk and flop all over the place but, if you said “hold still\\" so I can get some medications into your IV, they would hold that arm perfectly still for you. Meanwhile continuing the jerking act with the other arm and legs. As soon as medication was given, they would be awake, answering questions appropriately, etc. ** A note here to clarify about the medication we gave in the IV. It was generally not benzos/midazolam but another medication, ordered by the neurologist for these episodes. Some were ordered midazolam but, it was up to the neurologist and the judgement of us on scene as to the seizure being real or not. We would always say that we needed to get to their IV, so we could give them the medication their doctor ordered. We never said we were giving drug “A, B or C” and instead, give saline. Hopefully, other facilities don't play those games either, its unethical… ** The other type of pseudo/fake-seizure patient was basically an expert at it. They could and did fool many seasoned nurses, doctors and therapists. It was usually something very subtle that made us suspicious. Sometimes it was frequent admissions to different facilities that threw the first red flag. Some were able to withstand all types of procedures and not “break\\". I intubated one patient in particular on 3 occasions over a 2 week period due to her being so good at it, she would desaturate and be apenic for an extended period. I have had to intubate several for this. Imagine the addiction they must have to put up with intubation ( of course, I didn't just intubate without proper oxygenation and premedications. I would use etomidate or propofol for induction, per RSI protocol ) The Neurological team thinks that most of this type probably have real seizures in addition to the fake ones. Most of the patients that had mixed fake and real seizures also had suffered horrible abuse in their life (another story for another day). We would transfer this type of patient to another local hospital for 24 hour video EEG surveillance. It was not usually long before we got a report from the video EEG that would definitively answer any questions."},{"prompt":"Why aren't there any tall buildings like the Empire State or Chrysler buildings anymore?","completion":"“Why aren't there any tall buildings like the Empire State or Chrysler buildings anymore?” Well, it is obvious that there are many tall buildings, in NYC and elsewhere. Aside from the new WTC building, there are taller buildings all over the world. And NYC is home to the thinnest skyscraper — the Steinway Tower — 82 floors but actually at 1,400+ feet, as tall as the Empire State Building according to its website.

One thing is you need a pot for it, you also need some seafood forks to really eat it. If you want to really impress cook the lobster before-hand and then put it on ice or in the freezer for an hour to cool down.

When a new user lands on the web application, he/she is most likely to find it complex and a little tricky to use, considering its quite different from what he was using previously. For instance, a salesperson who has been using Excel sheets for a long time will naturally find it hard to use an application like Salesforce despite its obvious advantages. Naturally, since the user is more accustomed and habitual in using Excel sheets while he’s brand new to Salesforce. So the key is to get your user to acquaint themselves with the application and build a habit out of using it. This means you need to constantly guide and support the users.

You want to know how people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals? Well, I'm going to tell you straight up that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. But as a physical therapist who's worked with patients from all walks of life, I've seen some patterns emerge. First things first, let's talk about hunger. Hunger is a physiological response to an empty stomach. It's your body's way of telling you that it needs fuel. But here's the thing: hunger is not the same as appetite. Appetite is a psychological response to the thought or sight of food. It's why you might feel hungry even if your stomach is full after watching a cooking show or walking past a bakery. So, how do people who eat once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals? Well, it all comes down to a few key factors. Let's break it down. 1. Adaptation One of the main reasons why some people can go longer periods without eating is because their bodies have adapted to this eating pattern. Our bodies are incredibly adaptable and can adjust to different circumstances, including changes in eating habits. For example, I had a patient who was a devout Muslim and would fast from sunrise to sunset during Ramadan. Initially, he found it very difficult to go without food for so many hours, but over time, his body adapted and he no longer felt as hungry during the day. 2. Meal composition Another factor that can affect hunger levels is the composition of the meals themselves. Eating meals that are high in protein and fiber can help you feel fuller for longer periods of time. These types of foods take longer to digest, which means that they release energy slowly and keep you feeling satisfied for longer. 3. Mindset Finally, the way we think about food and hunger can also have an impact on how hungry we feel. If you're constantly thinking about food and focusing on your hunger, you're likely to feel hungry more often. On the other hand, if you can distract yourself with other activities and thoughts, you may not feel as hungry. I had a patient who was trying to lose weight and was constantly thinking about food. She would read recipes online and watch cooking shows, which only made her hunger worse. Once she started focusing on other activities, like going for walks or reading books, she found that she didn't feel as hungry as often. But why should you care? Now, you might be thinking, \\"Well, that's all well and good, but why should I care about people who eat once or twice a day?\\" Great question, my friend. The truth is, there are some potential benefits to this type of eating pattern. Intermittent fasting, which involves going without food for extended periods of time, has been shown to have a number of health benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, weight loss, and reduced inflammation. Of course, it's important to note that intermittent fasting isn't for everyone, and you should always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your diet. But it's worth considering if you're looking for a way to improve your overall health. The bottom line At the end of the day, everyone's body is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Some people are simply better able to tolerate hunger than others, and there's nothing wrong with that.

India will go around with iran and russia as usual. will forgo little oil imports if US is able to give some other attractive offer. US will forcefully sell some defence stuffs to India (in return of waiver for S-400) So don’t worry its going to be give and take. They won’t do anything against india for the next 35 years at least in the sense that “customer is king” is the principle of any business. And we do business as far as US is concerned. that’s not the case with Russia or Iran. if US had S-400, it wont have sold to India. only Russia shares such hi-tech and sensitive platforms with India.

Here are some important elements to consider: Knowledge and Research: Being knowledgeable about the sport or sports you are betting on is crucial. Understanding the rules, teams, players, and their performances can help you make more informed decisions. Stay updated with the latest news, statistics, and trends related to the sport.Strategy and Discipline: Develop a betting strategy that suits your style and goals. This could involve focusing on specific markets, analyzing historical data, using statistical models, or following expert advice. It's important to stick to your strategy and avoid impulsive or emotional betting decisions.Value Betting: Look for value in the odds offered by bookmakers. Value betting involves finding odds that are higher than the actual probability of an outcome occurring. By identifying undervalued bets, you increase your chances of long-term profitability.Risk Management: Assess the risks associated with each bet and consider factors such as team form, injuries, weather conditions, and other variables that can impact the outcome. Diversify your bets across different sports, markets, and events to spread the risk.Record Keeping and Analysis: Maintain a record of your bets, including details such as the date, event, type of bet, odds, and stake. This record can help you analyze your performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and adjust your approach accordingly.Emotion and Discipline: Avoid letting emotions, biases, or personal preferences influence your betting decisions. Stay disciplined and avoid chasing losses or making impulsive bets. Stick to your strategy and make calculated, rational choices. Remember, sports betting involves an element of chance, and there are no guarantees of success. It's important to approach it as a form of entertainment and only wager money you can afford to lose."},{"prompt":"What is refueling in nuclear reactors?","completion":"Refueling in nuclear reactors is removing the oldest fuel elements that have had the greatest burn-up of fuel (U-235 and/or Pu-239) with the greatest build-up of fission fragment poisons; and replacing them with fresh fuel elements.

Setting the record straight about how they have wronged you, does not work with them. You feel gutted about what they have done in the past, so you start a conversation trying to get the narcissist to understand how they have wronged you. All you achieve here is, you go into it gutted, you come out mind raped. You come out feeling exponentially worse. Why? How? F*ck why? Because you are dealing with a narcissist. You went into the interaction trying to get something out of it. They never give, only take. And when they see you want something from them, they take even more, and give even less. You have empowered them.

Lebanon is a mountainous nation, with two major ranges, the Mount Lebanon range and the Anti-Lebanon range. Since news reports say that the Israeli planes launched their missiles from Lebanon, the best guess is that they are using the Lebanon ranges to shield aircraft from targeting by Syrian SAMs. The planes likely pop up, fire their missiles and dive back down. At least one news report from Lebanon quoted Lebanese witnesses as saying the Israeli planes were flying low over the country. This would indeed suggest that the aircraft were using the Lebanese mountains as cover. Satellite photo of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains from Wikipedia. Israeli aircraft likely fly in the valley between the mountains, pop up and fire missiles into Syrian targets within range of their cruise missiles, and drop down again. This allows the IAF to continue to target Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria, while reducing the threat of Syrian SAMs (particularly S300s.) It also obviates the need to strike the S300s, which might be partly crewed by Russian personnel. I don’t think the Syrians have any reluctance to fire SAMs over Lebanon, but they can’t hit what they can’t see, and/or missiles will lose locks on targets once the Israeli aircraft drop below the mountains."},{"prompt":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","completion":"That all you need to know is: What the electrons are doingWhat the magnetic fields are doing Everything else is just a derivative.

This despite ALL OF THE FACTS. He has multiple CRIMINAL FEDERAL INDICTMENTS heading down the pipeline. With concrete evidence behind them. This is NO “witch hunt”, even though the Donald does practice some crafty nonsense. There is SOO much undisputable evidence that is stacking up against him in ALL of these cases. Most of it is SELF INFLICTED. For Example: Him talking to journalists at Bedminster when he knew he was being recorded for a book written by Pro-Trump writers who were later subpoenaed and handed over audio of Donny showing these journalist documents that were marked as highly classified documents, saying out loud everything he should not be saying. Like when he was President he could have declassified these documents but he didn’t and now he can’t and he could probably get into a lot of trouble by showing these to them. OMG Donny then WTF are you showing them to them? Simply the fact that he tweeted TWICE encouraging the continuation of the riot at the capital while it was in progress. This was after he stirred up the hornets nest before the riot and promised them he would go to the capital with them. Hours after people had already been severely injured and one person at least had died did he finally call off the dogs. This was NOT a false flag operation by an almost non existent antifa. That is a dog whistle. A Republican Dog Whistle. It doesn’t exist. But even if it did can you explain to me exactly what would be wrong with someone being “ANTI-FASCIST” That is where the name comes from. People who shout out “Fukc Antifa” at rallies and venues are basically saying “We Love Fascists We Love Fascists” WTF? That is so Anti-American it is ridiculous. How can you be a “Patriotic American” and NOT believe in DEMOCRACY? This on top of the things that EVERY REPUBLICAN IS COMPLETELY IGNORING about Donald Trumps past. His first wife Ivanna, when she filed for divorce from Donald, said that he often forced her into having sex with him and that the last time it happened he was so aggressive with her that he pulled her hair so hard that he ripped chunks of her scalp from her skull as she cried and he continued. In all fairness she did later walk those statements back. But the people who are friends with her say she was motivated to walk them back with more money from Donald. They were true. During that marriage to his first wife. He once took a family European vacation. He took with him on the flight to Europe his three oldest children and his wife Ivanna. Also on the plane (albeit not in first class with the rest of the family but still on the same exact plane) was his mistress Marla Maples. She also stayed at the same hotels Donald did throughout this vacation so that he could take breaks from the family and go have nookie nookie with his bed warmer. Slimy. Donald has NEVER been a faithful husband and has cheated on every single one of his wives. He cheated on Marla with Melania and then he cheated on Melania with at least Stormy Daniels and The Playboy Model. And those are just the ones that have come forward. He also doesn’t even wear a condom when he has unprotected sex with porn models. Honestly I would be more worried for them than I would be for Donald. He’s had his finger dipped in more cream pies then Bessy the Cow From Bordon. Then there is Donald when he used to own the Miss Teen USA pageantry system. “Teen” remember that word. Donald used to barge himself right into the dressing room at these contests when all of the contestants were mostly naked getting ready for the competition. He would shout out to the room: “Don’t worry ladies I’ve seen it all before.” He claimed he would be there for “inspections” because he was the owner of the pageant. Then later on Howard Stern he would brag about how he always was getting away with things like that because of who he was. There was also the time he went on Oprah Winfrey’s show with his daughter Ivanka. During the show Oprah was trying to throw them both some soft ball questions. She told them: “OK I am going to ask you to both answer the same question now. Tell me what do you two have in common with each other? What are some of the interests that you both share? Ivanka went first and she said “Real Estate, Golfing, and my love of New York”. Oprah “Oh that’s great. What about you Donald?” LONG PAUSE LONG PAUSE “Donald?” “Well… I was going to say SEX but I thought you would think that was inappropriate.” YES WE DO. Or the time he took Ivanka with him for an interview with Dr. Phil on his show. During that taping Donald asks Dr. Phil with his daughter sitting right next to him, “Is it wrong that I find myself being more sexually attracted to my “TEENAGED” daughter than I am to my own wife?” If you play back the version that was aired on TV you won’t get to see the reaction Dr. Phil had to this question. However there were over 200 people sitting in the live audience who did here the exchange and quickly started posting messages online about what they had just heard. And there is one of his favorite lines to tell people that he has repeated dozens of times on different interviews that: “I’ve always said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter I would probably be dating her.” Gross Donald you daughter is NOT INTERESTED go crawl in a hole somewhere. This is one of my favorites and it is more recent. Donald is over six foot tall. He is usually the tallest person in the room. I think James Comey might have been a little taller and that might have been one of the reasons why Donald was so threatened by him. But about during his third year as President his youngest son Barren was having a growing spurt and was quickly approaching Donald’s same height. Donald asked the boy’s Dr.’s if there was something they could give him that would STUNT HIS GROWTH. Because he wanted to be taller than everyone… Is there a word similar to the Napoleon Syndrome but where someone just thinks they are the smallest in the room. STUNT HIS GROWTH… Disgusting. YET here we are with a 40.3% favorable rating. WHY? HE IS NO CONSERVATIVE. HE DID NOT DRAIN THE SWAMP he dredged it. You people are voting against your own interests and you continue to support him.

There are many confined spaces onboard naval vessels, ballast tanks etc even lockers that aren’t opened for a long time. They could harbour toxic or flammable gases, lack of breathable oxygen. So a permit system is used. A 10 metre barrier is erected around the entrance before the space is opened. No one is allowed to enter the barriered space. Once open the tank will be ventilated for 24 hours using a powerful fan and ventilation trunkings. After that a qualified person and a trained back up person will go to the tank, one will enter with breathing apparatus and take air samples from all areas of the tank, the other person remains at the tank entrance as safety man. Once all tests have been carried out a safe to enter certificate will be issued. The tank will be constantly ventilated whilst it’s open and atmosphere tests will be conducted periodically, about once every 24hrs."},{"prompt":"Can we defeat Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle by having one person measure the particle's position, while another one measures its momentum, but the two people don't talk to each other, but give their results to a third party?","completion":"Well the first problem is the measurements must have a sequence. You cannot do a strong measurement without an interaction. And interactions on the same particle always have a definite sequence. Let’s say position is measured first. That will not still be the same value when momentum is measured. And via versa. Now you could in principle do weak measurements (interference pattern) observations at the same time. But then neither would learn the value they measuring to the accuracy your technique requires. The cheat people try to use is measure entangled particles. As conservation laws allow you to derive the values of one entangled particle from another. Only what you learn is the two particles are related exactly the same as if it was a single particle measured at two different times. If you measure the same value twice you get consistent results. Otherwise all bets are off."},{"prompt":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","completion":"That girl in my class who struggles for her education.

You could say he’s pretty much the “god of evil” in Christian theology. The thing about Christianity is, its capital-G God (also called Jehovah by some branches, Yahweh in Judaism, etc.) is described as all-powerful and all-knowing — that’s the level of power that the term “god” is reserved for in Christianity. Lesser beings are described as angels or devils or spirits instead, even though many of them would be considered gods by a polytheistic type of a worldview. Heck, some polytheistic religions believe that basically everything has a minor god of some sort associated with it. The term “god” means different things to different people, that’s basically what I’m saying here. And atheists don’t believe in any variety of gods. That’s the basic definition of the word “atheist.” Satan is also worshipped as a deity by certain types of Satanists (not all, though, despite what the name “Satanist” might imply — some types of Satanists are atheists themselves and only use Satan as a symbol rather than believing he exists as an actual being, for example.) So… yeah.

They are domesticated in the sense they bond with humans and can get along, but otherwise totally feral. It is not an exercise issue, or any issue other than they are feral. They must hunt, roam, pack (with other dogs) and will no matter how bonded they are. Granted they most often return home, but it’s when they decide to return home. My fiance finally realized this (she had argued with me about it for 2 years) when we moved to my new farm. We have over 7 acres fenced in and the dog could run, play and roam.

It is made with a base of alcohol and water, and then it is mixed with essential oils. The alcohol evaporates quickly, so the perfume will last for hours. Eau de toilette is a less concentrated form of fragrance. It has a lower concentration of essential oils than perfume, so it will not last as long as perfume does on your skin. Cologne is an even less concentrated form of fragrance than eau de toilette. Cologne usually contains about 2% to 3% essential oils in its base, which means that it will only last for about 30 minutes on your skin before you need to reapply it."},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"The short answer is, yes, in fact, it is the most important thing.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"I have experience with both private and public schools. I have found that the teachers are better qualified and better trained in public schools. Consequently, instruction is better. So why do private schools have higher scores? There are a few reasons. First, look at public schools in high income areas. They also perform very well on tests. Basically, private schools start with better prepared raw material. A number of research studies have found that the number one indicator of student success in school is their mother’s level of education. I’ve worked in schools where the average mother was a college graduate. I’ve also worked in schools with parents who had an elementary school education. Whose kids do you think did better? Parents who can afford to send their kids to private schools tend to be wealthier and better educated. Often, their children are already reading when they enter kindergarten. Second, private schools are not bound by the same laws that cover public education. For one, they are allowed to select their student body. If a student is misbehaving, lower performing, or needs special education support, etc., the private school sends them off to the local public school. Third, private schools often require that the parents of their students either donate to the school, work a certain hours per month at the school, or both. Many lower income public school parents don’t have either the time or the resources to meet that requirement."},{"prompt":"Do all entrepreneurs need an outside investor?","completion":"No."},{"prompt":"Are there alternatives to pistol slides?","completion":"Oh yes.

Without getting into situations like someone having terminal cancer AND complete loneliness then what I mean by this is; in my time in prison, without the use of internet and while still having news you can only talk to other people and try to learn from what they say. While you must take their opinions with a grain of salt, you can still find wisdom in anything in life. I saw LGBT related news on the internet and while debating with a religious person on why this was only a thing recently and while they should have been around longer than 2010 (first time I seen a man who didn’t not want a woman, and we all looked down on it in a public school). He made an interesting point. How long have we been in this safe society? I understand there might be someone like me who can invade your house and threaten your family, but we don’t live in scary times where everyday was a struggle to eat or die (killing large and prey and even larger predators) worrying about food and shelter vs taxes and job security. Or how about offending a government like the Romans, worrying about black plague, colonialism/slavery, mass genocide. people seem to forget what our ancestors went through, now you’re going to be sad about gender related things????? Or perhaps you’re too shy to even talk to someone and make a friend?????? make it make sense. some people say: you must take the Buddhist approach and not want anything and you’ll be content, find peace and possibly happiness. But what if you just sacrificed time, even a decade and did the Tate approach. (There’s more guys out there spouting this but they aren’t coming to mind) sacrifice a few years possibly even a decade of your life. Dedicate it to only gaining wealth, working on your body, mind and soul. not wasting it partying or pleasing others. I strongly doubt you will not have what you seek. First you need money. That will solve 95% of your problems. From that you won’t need to work as much which opens your availability up. Now you can attend hobbies you actually want to do and slowly make friends that way. You may be bitter and resentful toward life at first but work something like “skip the dishes” where you are forced to interact with people. After a couple days of smiling and showing enthusiasm, it will feel natural again and you will be likeable/approachable. So we have beaten poverty which beats most problems, now we have beaten loneliness. I haven’t gotten to any problems past this as I have only reached this level. so why aren’t people happy? My answer: they choose not to be. They don’t want to make the choices that will make them happy. They need to stay in their comfort zone which is easy for them"},{"prompt":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","completion":"The sheer hubris involved in the assumption that your life has a “purpose” boggles the mind.

You have couched the question using a false assumption : that conservatives do not think gun regulation is a good thing — which is not true. Building a question based on a false assumption is “disinformation.” There are more than 300 gun regulation laws Most people who do not own fire arms are uneducated about gun control — mainly because the realm of firearms is already fully legislated and regulated. The problem that eludes you is the laws are not enforced. Gun regulation is indeed a good thing, we can ALL agree on that — and the conservatives already know that.

The most important quality in a bullet is am aerodynamic shape. They must reach the target, often at ranges well in excess of 300 yards. Aside from aerodynamics, most bullets have some sort of critical secondary characteristic. Bullets such as the NATO SS109 round carry a stainless penetrator within the bullet. This is important because the round is a 5.56mm, not that much larger than a .22. As soon as it impacts anything at its very high velocity, it becomes unstable, so previous versions of the bullet were unable to penetrate a vehicle and then do damage inside. The penetrator changed that to a certain extent (you can only get so much energy out of a little bullet, though this is controversial). Some bullets are quite blunt, with a hollow point, which is designed to mushroom out when it hits its target. This ensures that the bullet will not pass through the target and hit an unintended target. Bullets designed for tubular magazines, such as the 30-30 Winchester, must have a bit of a blunt point, lest one bullet's tip ignite the primer of the bullet in front of it in the magazine.

It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

Here are some of the main points: Advantages: Enhanced Learning Experience: Technology can make learning more interactive, engaging, and immersive, thereby improving the overall learning experience for students.Access to Information: The internet and digital resources provide students with easy access to vast amounts of information, allowing them to explore topics beyond what traditional textbooks offer.Personalized Learning: Technology enables adaptive learning platforms that can tailor educational content to the individual needs and learning styles of students, promoting personalized learning experiences.Collaboration and Communication: Technology facilitates collaboration among students and between students and teachers. It enables seamless communication through various tools such as online discussion forums, video conferencing, and instant messaging.Multimodal Content: Technology enables the integration of various multimedia elements like videos, images, and interactive simulations, making learning more engaging and effective for visual and auditory learners.Real-World Applications: Technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can bring real-world experiences into the classroom, allowing students to explore and interact with subjects in a more immersive and practical manner. Disadvantages: Infrastructure and Access: Unequal access to technology and reliable internet connections can create disparities among students, limiting their ability to fully benefit from tech-based learning.Distractions: The presence of technology in the classroom can potentially lead to distractions if not properly managed, with students being tempted to engage in non-educational activities.Technological Issues: Technical glitches, software compatibility problems, and equipment failures can disrupt the learning process and consume valuable instructional time.Teacher Training: Integrating technology effectively into teaching requires proper training and professional development for teachers. The lack of adequate training can hinder the effective use of technology in the classroom.Dependence and Reliability: Relying heavily on technology for teaching may lead to dependence, making it challenging to switch to traditional teaching methods if needed. Additionally, technical failures or outages can disrupt the learning process. It's important to note that the advantages and disadvantages can vary depending on the specific context, resources, and implementation of technology in the teaching process.

Can you imagine any Republican, let alone the leader of the Republican party in the House or Senate advocating for the right of same sex marriage or the right to termination of pregnancy? That will never happen . Before anyone feels the need to point out that same sex marriage was legalised in 2015 in the US, let me state that iam aware of the SCOTUS decision in Obergefell Vs Hodges that led to the legalisation of same sex marriage at federal level.

Yes, Bhisma is greater than Krishna in terms of personal integrity.When Shukracharya asked Bali not to donate anything to the dwarf, Bali refused and said “Bhudevi said that “I’ll hold the one who has committed any sin but not the one who has renaged his promise”.” Bali donated the land to Vishnu who is in the incarnation of a dwarf.Bali is an Asura, but he has very good qualities and was a very good and charitable king. Inspite being an Asura, he never reneged his promise. But, Krishna did. However, raising weapon against the one who is battling another one is not fair according to the rules of “Dharma-yuddha”. When Bhisma defeated Arjuna and was about to slay Arjuna, Krishna was enraged and was about to attack Bhisma. So, the rules violated are: 1- Anyone should not interfere in the battle between two, Bhisma defeated Arjuna and was about to slay him. The battle ends when either one is killed, after sunset, or after one surrendered. So, clearly Krishna violated the rule. 2-The ones who are on the chariot should not attck the others who are foot soldiers or others and the ones who are without a chariot should not attack the ones who are on chariot. So, Krishna violated the rule by attacking the Bhisma who is on chariot. 3-A charioteer must serve the job as charioteer itself, no charioteer should battle. Charioteers can be killed and that’s fair according to the rules of Dharma-yuddha . Krishna is afterall a charioteer. Its foolish that he thinks he can defeat Bhisma who is the son of Ganga and an undefeated warrior. Only Karna, Ashwatthama and Shiva can defeat Bhisma in a fair fight. Bhisma is a very great person and he never broke his promises. He’s not like Krishna who reneges his promises. Now, some might argue that Shiva married Parvati inspite he promised he’ll not marry again.I’ll write down why Shiva married Parvati.After Sati immolated herself, Shiva was extremely sad and in case if he marries again, the woman might have the same situation as Sati, so Shiva pledged not to marry again. Tārakāsura had a clever boon from Brahma that he can only be defeated by Shiva’s son. In case you don’t know, what happened next, you can check in Wikipedia about what happened. Shiva married Parvati only to save the world but not out of anger or his brother in law was defeated by someone.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","completion":"Detaching oneself from trauma bonding is similar to the stages of grieving when someone we love dies. We grieve over the forced detachment (death) while choosing the detach from trauma bonding triggers grieving. Since everyone experiences grieving differently it only makes sense we might experience other forms of detachment in a similar fashion….The slight difference between both types of detachment is force and choice. There are days during the grieving process where detachment is unbearable and days where we feel stronger and empowered by the detachment. What plagues the survivors of npd abuse is our choice to save ourselves through detachment from the abuser. We live with our thoughts and decisions dictated for us while our emotions are played with like a toddler messing around with a slinky. We know our real ideas and thoughts are valid and reasonable although we are repeatedly told to ignore ourselves because the narcissist knows us better than we know ourselves. This forced mental conflict leaves us somewhat, if not entirely, dependent on the narcissists perspective. When we choose to detach from that mind control we battle with regaining self confidence, abandoning the narcissist because they somehow made us feel like they really wanted the best for us, and we battle our decision making. Since most narcissists are still living when we finally detach it's easier to feel compelled to reattach ourselves to the person that induced so much trauma because we learned how to survive through it before. Speaking for myself only, detachment from the trauma bond to my mother has been bittersweet. Bitter are the memories of crying to be loved, comforted when fear was overwhelming, or I just needed help to understand things. Sweeter than fresh honey from a beehive is knowing I am allowed to make my own decisions, associate with whomever I choose, and be the kind of mother my son deserves. Bitter is the financial situation I am battling but knowing I am not tied to an abusive person through financial security is sweet and allows me to sleep peacefully after 38 years of misery. I have days where I want to call my mother just to scream and curse at her but it will accomplish nothing. I maintain my detachment from any bond I felt or had with her and I remain with zero contact.

That’s what they are there for. It all comes down to HOW you use them. Men and women, who like myself are or were in broadcasting, use or used their diaphragms to push large amounts of air through the voice box when speaking. We didn’t strain our voices by asking them to carry the whole load. We were taught good vocal technique. Singers do the same. They don’t ask their throat to do the whole job. They sing from way down deep within, lurching with the aforementioned diaphragm. Lots and lots of breath control. Vocal coaches help them manage the use of air so they remain true to the pitch of their song, and not sharp (too much air) or flat (too little air). Just as. Instruction workers use safety glasses and hard hats foremen are taught to use bull horns as opposed to yelling. There is a lot of noise in those plants and the crew is wearing ear plugs. That piece of gear is invaluable. To do differently will strain your voice, causing horseness and damage. Nodules can form on the vocal cords and surgery to remove them becomes necessary. After that surgery it can take about a year before you can resume using your voice again. If you notice the signs of early vocal strain and horseness go see the doctor as soon as you can. You’ll be instructed to “lay off” using your instrument (your voice) for a time the doctor deems proper.

They would perform for their amusement and be given as gifts. A small price to pay for entertainment. The Ancient Chinese practised foot binding on young girls, which involved breaking their toes and bending their feet to make them smaller and more attractive. In 1866, Liechtenstein sent out an army of 80 men to participate in the Austro-Prussian War. They came back with 81 men, suffering no casualties and having made one friend. The Ancient Greeks used to exercise in the nude and the word Gymnasium actually means, “A place to exercise naked,” in Greek. In 1325, two rival Italian city states, Bologna and Moderna went to war over a stolen bucket. Between 1913 to 1915, people could mail babies via the US postal service. Ancient Thebes once assembled an elite military force consisting of 150 pairs of male gay lovers. They went undefeated in war for years. Pineapples In the 18th century, used to be rented as symbol of wealth and power. People would rent them for a single night just to show off to fellow partygoers. Ancient Rome was 8 times more densely populated then modern New York. The Austrian army once mistakenly attacked and fought against themselves during the battle of Caransebes. The confusion led to hundreds of casualties. Diarrhea was so widespread and common that in the 19th century, people would develop opium habits, because opium made you constipated."},{"prompt":"it possible to achieve native fluency as an adult with no prior experience in a language without living in a country where it is the primary language (for any period of time)?","completion":"The key phrase here is “native fluency.” Adults just don’t acheive native fluency, even with onsite immersion for years.

It was a little over 10,000. I live in California and the bank teller, whom I have met several times over recent years was very pleasant about asking me if I was withdrawing the money for a particular reason. I said that I was. The withdrawal was to be by electronic transfer and so he also asked me if the transfer details had been handed directly to me by a person whom I knew worked for the organization to which the money was going or if I was sending the transfer to an unknown number which I was given by an e-mail. I said that the bank transfer details were in an e-mail. So he asked if I might mind calling the company which I knew was to receive my money in order to verify the transfer account details. Yes, I know that is asking me for a lot of work to complete a transaction with my own money. Why shouldn’t I have the right just to wire transfer my money to anyone whom I please as long as I have the numbers. Well the bank has a duty of care, I could have been defrauded. Someone might have intercepted my plan to transfer the money, someone may have sent me fraudulent transfer details, made up a fake invoice, any number of reasons why they may want to take my money and make it theirs. Well I called the company who had sent me the transfer details and confirmed the numbers of the transfer account and then rechecked all of the details twice more. To make certain the transaction was secure and would be delivered properly. I never get upset with bank tellers asking me to check or confirm any transactions. I do it myself and I am happy to have someone else with my account security in mind. Only a few months ago, the city where I currently live, Fresno was a victim of a scam. Someone sent them a bill for several million dollars, The city clerk who received the invoice passed it through, the invoice was from a company which the city did business with, or so it seemed. The cash was transferred via wire transfer to an account which was not cross checked. The invoice was a forgery, the transfer details were not the details of the real company, that company did not even do the work that was invoiced for. There was no system in place to double check invoices to work or services. The city lost several million dollars in a fraction of a second. The same scam was pulled on several other cities in Calidfornia in previous years. So when someone questions the reason why you are moving your money, . Smile, think about the reason, enjoy the moment of having someone care for you as a customer. Then verify the reason, confirm details and verify all reasons again. The moment that verification actually takes is going to save you the heartache of handing over your cash to some scammer to enjoy. Thanks for reading. All the best."},{"prompt":"What if NITs were different countries, which country would they represent?","completion":"Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. Russia.

Why or why not?","completion":"My wife used to hear things that went bump in the night and sent me to investigate. I’d grab some form of “protection” and, like Winnie the Pooh looking for Heffalumps and Woozles, patrol the house and make sure there was no problem. Then we moved to a house with a slab foundation and the noise of the settling house went away. Until one night…. “Someone is opening the front door!!” She’d cried “Wolf” so many times that I didn’t bother to grab a baseball bat or whatever and walked out of the bedroom. Did I mention that I sleep naked? I sleep naked. Anyway, I walked out of the bedroom and there was her brother who had just let himself in at 2 in the morning. He had been in our area at some event and rather than drive home 20 miles or so at that hour, he thought he’d let himself in with the key that he had for when he house sat for us, and wasn’t quite as quiet as he’d intended to be. I told him “Hi, see you in the morning” as my wife stuck her nose out of the bedroom and went back to bed.

But from what I can gather, ENTJs are more inclined to immerse themselves in physical stimulation than INTJs, who (with extroverted sensing as their weakest function) can find too much external stimulation overwhelming. ENTJs are also more likely to enjoy engaging with people via activities, whereas INTJs are more likely to enjoy engaging with people in conversation. ENTJs may also be more comfortable making fast decisions, whereas INTJs may take longer to mull over things before coming to a conclusion. I found the following pages from Type in Mind to be quite good at illuminating the similarities and differences between the two types: [LINKED_TEXT: TeNi (ENTJ)] [URL: http://www.typeinmind.com/teni/][LINKED_TEXT: NiTe (INTJ)] [URL: http://ww.typeinmind.com/nite/]"},{"prompt":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","completion":"We only value the people in life once the are gone…Manmohan ji’s contribution in india’s economy will allways be remembered no matter how big and loud will be the advertizement of the oppostion party…."},{"prompt":"What is your worst cinema experience?","completion":"My worst experience would have to be when I saw Titanic.

And since there are two types, linear dichroism and circular dichroism, let’s be specific and note that it’s the first of these two (linear) that’s at play here. First, the name dichroism itself suggests an effect related to color. But that is not what leads to polarization. Polarization arises from differences in absorption. So let’s start there, and for the moment let’s talk about monochromatic light only. In some (crystalline) anisotropic materials there is a dipole moment associated with electron transitions in the constituent molecules, and it has a preferred orientation with respect to the structure of the molecule. What that means is that the likelihood of a transition (absorption or emission) will depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the electric field. Simply put, linearly polarized light will be absorbed more or less, according to its orientation (azimuth). The anisotropy therefore manifests itself as presenting to linearly polarized light two different absorption coefficients. Thus, as unpolarized light travels through a material exhibiting dichroism, the transmitted light becomes increasingly partially linearly polarized, with the polarized component aligned with the direction for which the absorption coefficient is smaller. Another effect can be seen. If the incident is already linearly polarized and not aligned with either of the absorption axes, the transmitted light will maintain its linear polarization but be rotated toward the axis showing less absorption. Thus linear dichroism presents one form of optical activity. But why was the effect given a name (dichroism) related to color? The answer lies in the fact that the magnitude of the differential absorption can depend on wavelength. That is, dichroism can exhibit dispersion. As a result, when white light passes through tourmaline and is viewed through a polarizer, the observed color of the transmitted light changes as the polarizer is rotated. One can imagine this being the first observation that was made on such crystals, and so the effect was given a color-related name, which stuck."},{"prompt":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","completion":"I don’t know, but I do know the GOP is way farther to the right than I’ve ever seen it.

Both of the parents were dark and this little girl has red hair, light eyes and was the tallest kid in her class by five years old. The mother was short and so was the father.
