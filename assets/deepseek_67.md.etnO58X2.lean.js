Goldenberg is the author of The Way It Works , a bestselling book about his experiences working with Chrétien . He was described as Chrétien 's \`\` Machiavelli . '' - The Premier of Ontario is the first minister of the Crown for the Canadian province of Ontario. - The Faculty of Law is a constituent faculty of McGill University, in Montreal, Quebec. Its graduates obtain both a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) and Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.), concurrently, in three to four years, allowing them to practise in both the Canadian, U.S. and UK common law system as well as Quebec's civil law system. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - An interim leader, in Canadian politics, is a party leader appointed by the party's legislative caucus or the party's executive to temporarily act as leader when a gap occurs between the resignation or death of a party leader and the election of a formal successor. Usually a party leader retains the leadership until a successor is formally chosen however, in some situations this is not possible, and an interim leader is thus appointed by the party's caucus or the party executive. An interim leader may also be appointed while a leader is on a leave of absence due to poor health or some other reason, and then relinquish the position upon the leader's return. - Jean Pelletier, (February 21, 1935 January 10, 2009) was a Canadian politician, who served as the 37th mayor of Quebec City, Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office, and chairman of Via Rail. He was a leading organizer of the Liberal Party of Canada. - Robert Keith \\"Bob\\" Rae, (born August 2, 1948) is a Canadian lawyer, negotiator, public speaker, and former politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre and was the interim leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2011 to 2013. He was previously leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party and the 21st Premier of Ontario, from 1990 until 1995. - McGill University is an English and French-language public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, ranked among the world's top 30 institutions. It was established in 1821 by royal charter, issued by King George IV of Great Britain. The University bears the name of James McGill, a prominent Montreal merchant from Scotland whose bequest in 1813 formed the university's precursor, McGill College. - Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien (born January 11, 1934), known commonly as Jean Chrétien, is a Canadian politician and statesman who served as the 20th Prime Minister of Canada from November 4, 1993 to December 12, 2003. - Via Rail Canada (generally shortened to Via Rail or Via; styled corporately as VIA Rail Canada) is an independent Crown corporation, subsidized by the Minister of Transport, mandated to offer intercity passenger rail services in Canada. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - The Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP or NDP) is a social democratic political party in Ontario, Canada.

Reports are surfacing from some Apple Watch early adopters that the new device is not working properly when worn on wrists with heavily tattooed skin. The photo of the malfunctioning Apple Watch posted by a Redditor. Photo: Reddit / guinne55fan One such account emerged on the social news website Reddit where one anonymous user posted two photos and a detailed explanation of their experience with wearing an Apple Watch on their tattooed wrist. The user said that the watch did not receive notifications for incoming text messages and emails when worn over their tattoo. The Apple Watch emits a green light when measuring the wearer's heart rate. \\"I was about to give up and call Apple tomorrow when I decided to try holding it against my hand (my left arm is sleeved [with a tattoo] and where I wear my watch is tattooed as well) and it worked,\\" the Redditor wrote. \\"My hand isn't tattooed and the Watch stayed unlocked. Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink the watch would automatically lock again.\\" Advertisement The Apple watch is designed to shut down when left idle for a few seconds and, unless it is worn against the skin, can only be woken up if you type in a pass code.​ The Redditor​ said they had reported the issue to Apple and that, after speaking with a customer representative, \\"it seems like I'm not the only one\\". Since that post, other tattooed users have emerged on Twitter with similar complaints. Many have been using the hashtag #TattooGate, a reference to earlier Apple-related product malfunctions, notably #AntennaGate with the iPhone 4 and #BendGate with the iPhone 6 Plus. Not all tattoos causes the watch to malfunction, however. A Redditor with lighter coloured tats has given the watch the all clear while the issues are not being reported by wears with naturally darker skin. Speculation is that the problem lies with the sensors at the back of the watch that is used to detect skin contact and activate the watch, as well as to measure blood flow so that it can give a reading on the wearer's pulse. The sensors are designed to pulse light onto the skin in order for readings to be taken. But in the case of very dark tattoo ink, it would absorb the light much better than any natural skin tones, meaning the watch could be duped into thinking it was not being worn. That, at least, is the theory. Fairfax Media Follow Digital Life on Twitter . ||||| Your mother hates your tattoos. So does your Apple Watch, apparently. Tattooed wrists can prevent the Apple Watch's heart rate sensor from functioning properly, according to some customers. Since the Apple (AAPL) Watch uses your heart rate to determine whether you're wearing it, you might not be able to use Apple Pay, receive notifications, place calls, or use certain apps if you have tattoos on your wrists. Some Apple Watch wearers on Reddit and Twitter complained about the tattoo issue, and Apple blog iMore confirmed that the problem exists. The issue stems from the way that the Apple Watch senses your heartbeat. According to Apple, the back of the Watch rapidly flashes green and infrared light at your skin, which gets absorbed or reflected by your red blood. When your heart beats, there is more blood in your wrist, and there is less blood between beats. By sensing the timing between your heartbeats, the Apple Watch can calculate your heart rate. As it turns out, solid-colored tattoos -- particularly red ones -- also absorb the green light and reflect red light. Black tattoos, which absorb both green and red light, can also screw up the Apple Watch's heart rate sensor. The Apple Watch works fine with dark-colored skin, scars and skin abrasions, which are translucent, allowing light to pass through. Tattoo ink is opaque, preventing outside light from penetrating your skin. One Reddit user found that he could turn off the Apple Watch's wrist detection, allowing notifications to come in. But he couldn't use Apple Pay or receive calls without the wrist detection setting turned on. A spokeswoman from Apple did not respond to a request for comment. ||||| Press J to jump to the feed. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts u/guinne55fan ||||| Recently, we've been hearing reports from Twitter and Reddit that the Apple Watch's plethysmograph sensor plays not-so-nicely with wrist or arm sleeve tattoos. The ink pigmentation interferes with the sensor's ability to read your heart rate — and with it, the Watch's ability to assess whether or not it's maintaining skin contact. After some brief tests, we're inclined to agree with those early reports — if your tattoo happens to be a solid, darker color. This is has to do with the way Apple measures your heart rate. Let's break it down. Apple's support article on the Watch's heart rate sensor explains a fair amount about its inner workings, including how it measures your pulse: The heart rate sensor can also use infrared light. This mode is what Apple Watch uses when it measures your heart rate every 10 minutes. However, if the infrared system isn't providing an adequate reading, Apple Watch switches to the green LEDs. In addition, the heart rate sensor is designed to compensate for low signal levels by increasing both LED brightness and sampling rate. Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light. Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist — and the green light absorption — is greater. Between beats, it's less. By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute — your heart rate. In short, Apple uses various spectrums of light to track the blood flow through your skin. Anything that reduces that light's reflectiveness — ink pigmentation within your skin, for example — can interfere with that sensor. For those wondering: natural skin pigmentation doesn't block light the same way artificial ink pigment or even scar tissue does, so you shouldn't run into a problem if your skin is naturally darker. The Watch and tattoos So does the Watch run into problems with wrist tattoos? Yes and no. I spent an hour today testing the Watch's sensor reading on multiple tattoo colors, and have indeed managed to replicate some of the issues Reddit and Twitter users were having. For disclosure: We tested the Watch's sensors against tattooed and non-tattooed sections on both the wrist and elsewhere on the body. On non-tattooed non-wrist sections, the sensors gave identical readings as when also tested on the wrist; on tattooed sections, sensor readings varied wildly depending on colors and shading. Dark, solid colors seem to give the sensor the most trouble — our tests on solid black and red initially produced heart rate misreadings of up to 196 BPM before failing to read skin contact entirely. Tests on lighter tattoo colors including purple, yellow, and orange produced slightly elevated heart misreads of 80 BPM (compared to 69 BPM on the wearer's non-tattooed wrist), but otherwise did not appear to interfere with skin contact registration. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Reports have surfaced that the Apple Watch may have issues functioning properly when worn on wrists with heavily tattooed skin, primarily impacting the heart rate sensor.

What is the answer?","completion":"In technical astronomical terms, the duration of the winter solstice is an instant. The winter solstice is the precise moment when one of Earth's poles reaches its maximum tilt away from the Sun, resulting in the shortest day and longest night of the year in the respective hemisphere. To provide further context, Earth's tilt, which is approximately 23.5 degrees, causes the seasonal changes experienced throughout the year. As our planet orbits the Sun, different areas of Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight due to this tilt. The winter solstice occurs in the Northern Hemisphere around December 21 or 22, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs around June 20 or 21. At the time of the winter solstice, the Sun appears at its lowest point in the sky, resulting in reduced daylight hours and the longest night. Although the winter solstice itself is just an instant, colloquially, people may refer to the day itself as the \\"winter solstice.\\" However, it is crucial to understand that the term technically describes a specific moment in Earth's orbit around the Sun. In summary, the winter solstice is an instant, marking the exact point in time when one of Earth's poles has its maximum tilt away from the Sun.

How to identify a queen ant Look at the size of the ant. For many types of ants, queens are much larger than regular worker ants. If you stumble upon an ant that appears unusually large, there's a good chance this is the queen.","completion":"The next step is to consider the ant's physical characteristics such as the presence of wings. Queen ants are sometimes distinguished by their wings, especially during the reproductive stage when they leave their colonies to mate and form new ones. During this period, known as the nuptial flight, queens will have a set of wings while the worker ants will not. This distinction may not always hold true as after their nuptial flight, queens often shed their wings. However, you may still be able to spot scarring or stubs where the wings used to be, providing another clue that you're observing a queen ant. Step by step considerations: 1. Recognize the size of the ant as an anecdotal indicator. 2. Take into account that the presence of wings can indicate a queen ant. 3. Acknowledge exceptions like the fact that queens may lose their wings after the nuptial flight. 4.

Q: what are the three main branches of phonetics? A:","completion":"The three main branches of phonetics are: articulatory phonetics, acoustic phonetics, and auditory phonetics. These branches study the different aspects of speech sounds and their production, transmission, and perception. Here is a detailed explanation of each branch: 1. Articulatory Phonetics: Articulatory phonetics is the study of the physical processes that are involved in the production of speech sounds. This branch analyzes the movement and position of speech organs, such as the lips, tongue, teeth, vocal cords, and the air that passes through them, during the production of sounds. Articulatory phonetics primarily deals with the following aspects: a) Manner of articulation: This refers to how the air is manipulated or obstructed as it travels through the vocal tract. Different manners of articulation include stops (complete closure and release of air), fricatives (partial closure of the vocal tract, creating friction), nasals (airflow through the nasal cavity), approximants (minimal obstruction without any friction), and more. b) Place of articulation: This pertains to the point in the vocal tract where the obstruction or constriction of the air occurs. Key places of articulation include bilabial (both lips), labiodental (lower lip and upper teeth), dental (tongue against the upper teeth), alveolar (tongue against the alveolar ridge), palatal (tongue against the hard palate), and velar (tongue against the soft palate), among others. c) Voicing: This considers whether the vocal cords vibrate during the production of a sound. Voiced sounds involve vibration, while voiceless sounds do not. For instance, \\"b\\" and \\"p\\" are both bilabial stops, but \\"b\\" is voiced while \\"p\\" is voiceless. 2. Acoustic Phonetics: Acoustic phonetics is the study of the physical properties of speech sounds as they travel through the air as sound waves. This branch examines the attributes of these sound waves, such as frequency, amplitude, and duration. Acoustic phonetics helps to understand the following features of speech sounds: a) Fundamental frequency (pitch): This corresponds to the rate at which the vocal cords vibrate. A higher fundamental frequency results in a higher pitched sound, while a lower frequency produces a lower pitched sound. b) Amplitude (loudness): This reflects the intensity or energy of a sound wave, which is perceived as loudness. The amplitude depends on factors like the force of the airflow and the size of the vocal tract. c) Formants (resonant frequencies): These are the specific frequency components of a sound wave that give it its unique quality and distinguish it from other phonemes. They are determined by the shape and size of the vocal tract during the production of a speech sound. 3. Auditory Phonetics: Auditory phonetics is the study of how individuals perceive and process speech sounds. This branch focuses on the mechanisms in the human auditory system, such as the ear, the auditory nerve, and the brain, that are responsible for receiving and interpreting sound waves. Auditory phonetics looks into aspects like: a) Perception of individual speech sounds (phonemes): This involves understanding how listeners perceive phonemes or the smallest units of sound in spoken language that distinguishes one word from another. b) Categorical perception: This refers to the phenomenon where listeners tend to perceive a continuous range of sounds as belonging to distinct categories. For example, the different variations in the production of the phoneme /b/ will still be perceived as /b/. c) Perception of prosody: This deals with the perception of intonation, stress, and rhythm in speech. These elements contribute to conveying meaning, emotions, and emphasis in spoken language. In conclusion, the three main branches of phonetics—articulatory, acoustic, and auditory—collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the production, transmission, and perception of speech sounds in human language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in her garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that tries out his father's fishing rod? ? It's Christmas Eve and Richie Rich, the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes. During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called Root Canal. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process. Richie and Cadbury end up in an accident in which the sleigh falls and literally explodes along with the presents, while Cadbury hurts his ankle badly. Richie runs off to fetch help, but once he enters the city, he sees that the situation has changed dramatically. Reggie is cooking up rumors about him, and all the people have turned against him.

Given the question: Background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. Paragraph: There are two exact copies of planets, Necrulon and Krankor, including the animals and plants on each planet. Recently though, people on Krankor have been wanting to have more space for new buildings. In order to accommodate these new buildings, they have started to cut forests and clear land. The people on Necrulon, however, decided to keep their forests and land rather than further industrialize. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Krankor have more or less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon? The answer is:","completion":"Krankor has less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon. Step 1: Analyze the information provided in the paragraph. Both planets, Necrulon and Krankor, initially had the same number of autotrophic organisms. However, recent human activities on each planet have changed this dynamic. Step 2: Identify key changes that have occurred on each planet. Krankor has begun cutting forests and clearing land to make space for new buildings. This action reduces the number of autotrophic organisms by removing their habitat and it could also involve burning, which releases carbon dioxide. Conversely, Necrulon has chosen to maintain its forests and land, preserving the natural environment and the autotrophic organisms that inhabit it. Step 3: Compare the consequences of each planet's choices in relation to the number of autotrophic organisms. Since Krankor is destroying the habitat for autotrophic organisms, this will lead to a decrease in their population. On the other hand, Necrulon is preserving its forests and land, which supports the growth and maintenance of autotrophic organisms. Step 4: Determine which planet has more or less autotrophic organisms. Based on the actions taken by Krankor to clear land and cut forests, and Necrulon's decision to preserve its environment, it can be concluded that Krankor has fewer autotrophic organisms than Necrulon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Finally I waited 10 more min and got seated with Richie. He seemed distracted the whole time, I think looking at the owner or head woman, he even dropped the nail polish while mean muggin' her and she wasn't even looking.

Write a summary based on this article: In this image released by the White House, President Barack Obama meets with his national security team to discuss Afghanistan in Situation Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2009.... (Associated Press) In this image released by the White House, President Barack Obama meets with his national security team to discuss Afghanistan in Situation Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2009.... (Associated Press) President Barack Obama won't accept any of the Afghanistan war options before him without changes, a senior administration official said, as concerns soar over the ability of the Afghan government to secure its own country one day. Obama's stance comes as his own ambassador in Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, is voicing strong dissent about a U.S. troop increase, according to a second administration official. Eikenberry's misgivings center on a concern that bolstering the American presence in Afghanistan could make the country more reliant on the U.S., not less. He expressed them in forcefully worded cables to Washington just ahead of Obama's latest war meeting Wednesday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss administration deliberations. The developments underscore U.S. skepticism about the leadership of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, whose government has been dogged by corruption. The emerging administration message is that Obama will not do anything to lock in an open-ended U.S. commitment. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that she is concerned about Afghanistan's \\"corruption, lack of transparency, poor governance (and) absence of the rule of law.\\" \\"We're looking to President Karzai as he forms a new government to take action that will demonstrate _ not just to the international community but first and foremost to his own people _ that his second term will respond the needs that are so manifest,\\" Clinton said during a news conference in Manila with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo. Obama is still expected to send in more troops to bolster a deteriorating war effort. He remains close to announcing his revamped war strategy _ troops are just one component _ and probably will do so shortly after he returns from a trip to Asia that ends Nov. 19. Yet in Wednesday's pivotal war council meeting, Obama wasn't satisfied with any of the Afghanistan war options presented by his national security team, one official said. The president instead pushed for revisions to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government. In turn, that could change the dynamic of both how many additional troops are sent to Afghanistan and what the timeline would be for their presence in the war zone, according to the official. Military officials said Obama has asked for a rewrite before and resisted what one official called a one-way highway toward war commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal's recommendations for more troops. The sense that he was being rushed and railroaded has stiffened Obama's resolve to seek information and options beyond military planning, officials said, though a substantial troop increase is still likely. The president is considering options that include adding 30,000 or more U.S. forces to take on the Taliban in key areas of Afghanistan and to buy time for the Afghan government's small and ill-equipped fighting forces to take over. The other three options on the table are ranges of troop increases, from a relatively small addition of forces to the roughly 40,000 that McChrystal prefers, according to military and other officials. The war is now in its ninth year and is claiming U.S. lives at a record pace as military leaders say the Taliban has the upper hand in many parts of the country. Eikenberry, the top U.S. envoy to Kabul and a former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, is a prominent voice among those advising Obama, and his sharp dissent is sure to affect the equation. The options given to Obama will now be altered, although not overhauled. Military officials say one approach is a compromise battle plan that would add 30,000 or more U.S. forces atop a record 68,000 in the country now. They described it as \\"half and half,\\" meaning half fighting and half training and holding ground so the Afghans can regroup. \\"The government of Afghanistan has to accept greater responsibility for its own defense,\\" Clinton said Thursday. She had no comment on the Eikenberry memos. The White House says Obama has not made a final choice, though military and other officials have said he appears near to approving a slightly smaller increase than McChrystal wants at the outset. Among the options for Obama would be ways to phase in additional troops, perhaps eventually equaling McChrystal's full request, based on security or other conditions in Afghanistan and troop levels by U.S. allies there. The White House has chafed under criticism from Republicans and some outside critics that Obama is dragging his feet to make a decision. Obama's top military advisers have said they are comfortable with the pace of the process, and senior military officials have pointed out that the president still has time since no additional forces could begin flowing into Afghanistan until early next year. Under the scenario featuring about 30,000 more troops, that number most likely would be assembled from three Army brigades and a Marine Corps contingent, plus a new headquarters operation that would be staffed by 7,000 or more troops, a senior military official said. There would be a heavy emphasis on the training of Afghan forces, and the reinforcements Obama sends could include thousands of U.S. military trainers. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Manila, Philippines, and Pamela Hess in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| President Barack Obama expressed fresh doubts about the credibility of Afghanistan's government in high-level discussions Wednesday over what troops to send there, after his ambassador to Kabul warned against any reinforcements until the Afghan regime cracks down on corruption. U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry sent two classified cables to Washington in recent days raising serious concerns about the military's recommendation to increase troop levels, according to three U.S. officials. Mr. Eikenberry criticized Afghan President Hamid Karzai's recent behavior as well as corruption in the top ranks of his administration, according to an official who saw the memos. Mr. Karzai has in recent interviews lashed out at the U.S. and blamed corruption on international organizations working in his country. View Full Image Getty Images President Barack Obama speaks while flanked by Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the White House in May. In Wednesday's meeting, which Mr. Eikenberry attended via videoconference, Mr. Obama discussed options for adding troops for nearly 2½ hours. Two of the options were previously proposed by his top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal. A new \\"hybrid\\" option has recently gained momentum at the Pentagon, combining significant numbers of troops with trainers to improve Afghan forces' capability to secure the country themselves. A White House official said Mr. Obama made requests that could lead to significantly altering any or all of the choices, changing the number of troops involved and the length of their deployment. The official said Mr. Obama asked for specific timelines in each scenario for when U.S. troops would turn over security to Afghan forces. In the past, senior military officials have resisted such timelines. The key points of contention, the official added, were the timelines and questions about the credibility of the Karzai government -- both issues raised by Mr. Eikenberry in his cables and elsewhere. The ambassador has warned that an increased U.S. presence could take pressure off the Afghan government to take over security. The cables were first reported by the Washington Post on its Web site. Mr. Eikenberry is a retired three-star general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, so his views on troop levels are likely to carry weight. But Mr. Eikenberry is known to have a prickly relationship with Mr. Karzai dating back to that period, and earlier this year that forced Sen. John Kerry to become the U.S. go-between with the Afghan president. Wednesday's meeting was the last of several of Mr. Obama's war council before he leaves for a trip through Asia; some officials have said he aims to make a decision soon after he gets back Nov. 19, though deliberations could continue into next month. Other administration officials have begun to fan out to get feedback from allies: According to officials familiar with the effort, James Jones, the White House national security adviser, is expected to visit Pakistan this week to discuss U.S. deliberations over troop levels. Mr. Eikenberry's concerns come late in the process, and it is unclear how they will ultimately affect Mr. Obama's decision making. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently has supported the \\"hybrid\\" plan -- sending 30,000 to 35,000 troops including up to 10,000 trainers -- and has emerged as the key adviser within the administration. According to a military official, senior officers at the Pentagon, including Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, continue to back a recommendation by Gen. McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to send more than 40,000 troops. But they are increasingly throwing their weight behind the compromise plan as a way to get Gen. McChrystal most of what he needs. Many of Mr. Eikenberry's concerns about Mr. Karzai have been raised by others involved in the White House deliberations, including by Mr. Obama. Administration officials have pushed hard to get Mr. Karzai to come up with a checklist of \\"deliverables\\" that would illustrate he is cracking down on corruption after his Nov. 19 inauguration. According to a senior administration official familiar with the efforts, they have included a push for the Afghan president to fill top cabinet positions with competent technocrats -- rather than rewarding warlords who backed Mr. Karzai's re-election, such as Uzbek strongman Abdul Rashid Dostum. \\"The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended,\\" said a White House official briefed on Wednesday's meeting. \\"Governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner.\\" —Jay Solomon, Alan Cullison and Siobhan Gorman contributed to this article.

Advertise in the real world.","completion":"Title: Effective Techniques to Market Your Goods: From Photography to PPC Understanding what people desire, identifying their needs, and then structurally aligning your products to meet these needs is the essence of successful marketing. This framework also applies to the digital space compelling businesses to master the art of marketing their products online. This article explores the various strategies entailed in online marketing: taking good pictures, pricing items accurately, use of keywords, leveraging social media, targeted advertising, considering pay-per-click advertisements, and exploring real-world advertising. First and foremost, a deep understanding of what people want is a critical foundation in marketing. Conduct market research to figure out exactly who your customers are, what they want, what they value, and how they purchase goods. Surveys, focus groups and one-on-one interviews can help you familiarize with your target audience's preferences, buying behaviors, and choices. Once you understand your buyers, it's time to showcase your product. Pictures are an indispensable tool in digital marketing. Quality images capture the essence of your products, giving the customer an almost tangible awareness of what you have to offer. It's vital to consider professional photography or to learn the basics of taking high-quality images. When it comes to pictures, understand that quality should override quantity. Hence, invest in good lighting, the right angles, and appropriate backgrounds to emphasize the details of your products. Pricing your items appropriately is another crucial aspect. Price your items for what they are worth; too low might question their quality, too high might repel potential buyers. Keep in mind the price should not only cover the cost of production but also your overheads and desired profit margin. Conduct competitive analysis to observe pricing trends in your industry. Offering competitive prices attracts a diverse audience while assuring them of value for their money. Using accurate keywords in your product description and marketing content is another game-changer in the digital space. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a necessity for any online business. It's through the use of relevant and searchable keywords that your products become visible in online searches. Detailed and precise product descriptions, stuffed with relevant keywords, enhance your online visibility and raise your potential for higher sales. As an extension of your online presence, make use of social media. Today's digital-native customers are more likely to discover your brand through social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Develop engaging and shareable content, run promotional campaigns, and engage with your audience to build your brand's persona. Moreover, advertising where your potential buyers might be is a targeted marketing approach that will increase your reach. Programmatic marketing and geotargeting are examples of strategies that help reach people based on their location, browsing history, age, preferences, and more. These strategies help customize your advertisements to potential customers, enhancing the chances of conversion. Pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements are yet another efficient way to attract potential customers. PPC platforms like Google Adwords or Bing Ads can place your ads in a prominent position when users search for keywords you bid on, hence its potential for generating traffic towards your website. PPC advertisement ensures that you only pay for the ads that are clicked, making them a cost-effective way to direct high-quality traffic. Lastly, while a digital presence is vital, one should not underestimate the significance of real-world advertising. Flyers, word-of-mouth, billboards, or radio and television commercials still carry weight in reaching a diverse audience, especially for a localized business. In conclusion, online marketing demands a blend of strategies tailored to meet your business's unique needs and reach your customers effectively. Balancing these techniques, from understanding what people want, taking quality pictures, accurate pricing, using the right keywords, leveraging social media, considering PPC ads, and advertising in the real-world will balance the digital and physical aspects of your brand's reach, creating a comprehensive marketing strategy that drives your business towards success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: A eugenicist's project in the 19th century lead to the discovery of this effect. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? OPTIONS: 1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no And the answer is:","completion":"2). it is not possible to tell Explanation: The given premise only states that a 19th-century eugenicist had noticed an effect while trying to create an average criminal face through a photographic composite of multiple mug shots. However, it does not explicitly confirm or deny that the eugenicist's project directly led to the discovery of this effect. While there might be an indication of a possible connection between the project and the effect, it is not possible to conclusively establish that one caused the other without further information. To assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must consider the available information and context. In this case, the premise is focused on a specific event in which an effect became apparent. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the eugenicist's project directly contributed to the discovery of this effect. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must establish if the premise provides enough evidence to support the hypothesis. In the present case, there isn't enough information given to draw a definite conclusion. Therefore, the answer is option 2: it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the available information does not allow us to definitively determine the connection between the eugenicist's project and the discovery of the effect. Further information would be required to provide a definitive answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Article:","completion":"Title: UK Bank Executives' Sky-high Compensation Puts Shareholders and Taxpayers on Edge In the high-stakes world of banking, top executives have long been known for their multi-million pound paychecks. However, as financial institutions face mounting scrutiny from regulators and the public, the staggering sums awarded to UK bank chiefs are raising eyebrows and questions about corporate responsibility. Barclays CEO Bob Diamond is expected to receive a windfall of up to £27 million in pay, bonuses, shares, and other perks. This includes a £5.7 million payout from the bank to cover an increase in his tax bill when he moved from the United States to London. These figures have caused significant unease among shareholders and taxpayers alike, leading to heightened debates over the justification and implications of such vast sums being paid to corporate leaders. While Mr. Diamond's compensation is perhaps the most striking example, he is not the only bank chief embroiled in controversy over his pay package. Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) CEOs Antonio Horta-Osorio and Stephen Hester, respectively, are in line to receive awards worth up to £8.2 million and £7.9 million. This generous remuneration comes despite the fact that their banks experienced combined losses of £5.5 billion last year, highlighting the disconnect between executive pay and company performance. The issue is further exacerbated by the exorbitant bonuses paid to lower-ranking executives and employees. At Barclays, for instance, 238 senior staff members received average bonuses of £1.2 million, while nearly 400 employees at RBS obtained a sizable £820,000. Critics argue that this scale of remuneration encourages reckless risk-taking and short-term thinking in an industry already dogged by public distrust and regulatory crackdowns. Adding fuel to the fire is a recent report released by the City’s watchdog, which cites incompetence by executives as a key factor driving Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse. This damning indictment raises questions about the validity of such massive pay packages, particularly considering the bank's performance under their watchful eyes. In light of these revelations, investors, regulators, and the general public are left questioning whether these astronomical compensation figures can be justified, given the executives' actual performance and the potential long-term repercussions such lavish remuneration may have on the industry as a whole. With public confidence in the banking sector already plagued by endless scandals and controversies, the hefty pay packages of UK bank chiefs are likely to continue drawing scrutiny and intensifying calls for reform and accountability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Dendritic cells (DCs) link the sensing of the environment by the innate immune system to the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Accordingly, DCs are considered to be a major target in the development of immunomodulating compounds. In this study, the effect of niclosamide, a Food and Drug Administrationapproved antihelminthic drug, on the activation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived DCs was examined. Our experimental results show that niclosamide reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression of LPS-activated DCs. In addition, niclosamide also affected the expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules and influenced the ability of the cells to take up antigens. Therefore, in mixed cell cultures composed of syngeneic OVA-specific T cells and DCs, niclosamide-treated DCs showed a decreased ability to stimulate T cell proliferation and IFN-c production. Furthermore, intravenous injection of niclosamide also attenuated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in mice during sensitization with 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene. Blocking the LPS-induced activation of MAPK-ERK, JNK and NF-jB may contribute to the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on DC activation. Collectively, our findings suggest that niclosamide can manipulate the function of DCs. These results provide new insight into the immunopharmacological role of niclosamide and suggest that it may be useful for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders or DC-mediated autoimmune diseases. A:","completion":"Part #1: Research subject Usage: Dendritic cells (DCs) and their role in the immune system.

Question: Given the background: Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants. and the situation: Mike was preparing for his chemistry exam. To see the chemistry concepts in practice he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results. Answer the following question: In which test more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants, test A or test B? Answer:","completion":"In test A, more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants. The reason for this is that both reactants in test A are evenly dispersed in a homogeneous mixture, which means that the particles of each reactant are uniformly distributed throughout the solution. As a result, there is a higher likelihood of collision and interaction between the reactant particles, leading to a higher rate of reaction. In contrast, test B involves one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. As mentioned in the background, reactivity only occurs at the surface of the solid reactant, where its particles come into contact with the liquid reactant particles. This restricts the amount of reactant particles that have the chance to collide and interact, leading to a comparatively lower rate of reaction. In summary, test A offers a greater probability for reactant particles to come into contact with one another, due to the homogeneous nature of the mixture, whereas test B has limited contact points at the surface of the solid reactant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Bulgaria is famous for its roses and produces about 85 percent of all the rose oil in the world. Rose oil is called liquid gold and is used in making soaps, chocolates, perfumes and so on. The first records about growing roses on Bulgarian land go back many centuries. The Rose Valley developed in the area between the cities of Kazanlak and Karlovo in central Bulgaria. The roses seem to love the soil and weather there. The rose is the most important plant grown in Bulgaria, which could be called the country on the roses. The rose plantations in the Rose Valley are the largest in the world. Much of the population in the Rose Valley works in the rose industry. In Bulgaria, we produce rose oil, rose water and other products. Rose oil is used in high-quality perfumes produced in many countries. The main flower grown is the Kazanlak rose, which is famous around the world. The oil is prepared by distillation . Each flower is picked by hand, and you need 3,000 kilos to make one kilo of rose oil. That means about 30 flowers for just one tiny drop oil. So you can understand why it is so expensive and is called liquid gold. Each year on the first weekend in June, during the harvest, there is a Festival of Rose in Kazanlak with many performances. Judges choose the Queen of Roses as part of the summer festival. After this, she honors the most skillful picker of roses in the harvest. This festival is an old tradition and goes back more than a century. Today it also includes an International Folklore Festival and attracts many tourists. The festival ends with a concert in the evening. There are also festivals in Karlovo and other towns. Come to see and enjoy. Question: According to the passage, the Rose Valley _ .

A Nova Scotia family was reunited with their pet Saturday night after the animal crawled into a box bound for Alberta more than a week ago. Purolator employees discovered the cat in Montreal and called the local SPCA, which tracked down its owners. Jacqueline Lake had been searching for her family's one-year-old tabby for four days when she got the call. She and her family thought the cat might have escaped while the kids were leaving for school. They put up flyers and went around the neighbourhood knocking on doors and looking under sheds. \\"I was really starting to lose hope he was going to come back. He's a very docile kitty, but he's very curious and gets into things,\\" said Lake. Volunteers drove him home Lake guessed that the cat, Baloo, had crawled into a package containing a tire rim in the hour before she shipped it off. She thought it was strange that one of the packages weighed 10 lbs more than the others, but dismissed it as a possible problem with the rims. \\"He never made a sound, a single sound,\\" she said. Lake said she is \\"eternally grateful\\" to the SPCA and the network of volunteers with the organization Freedom Drivers who relayed Baloo back home. \\"I didn't have money to travel to Montreal to get my cat back, but we got him. I didn't have to pay anything. It was pretty amazing they did this for us,\\" Lake said.

Is it true that is the ankle considered part of the foot based on the following text? The hindfoot is composed of the talus (or ankle bone) and the calcaneus (or heel bone). The two long bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, are connected to the top of the talus to form the ankle. Connected to the talus at the subtalar joint, the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.","completion":"Based on the provided text, it can be inferred that the ankle is indeed considered a part of the foot. The text discusses the composition of the hindfoot, which includes the talus (ankle bone) and the calcaneus (heel bone). The mention of these bones as components of the hindfoot supports the idea that the ankle is a part of the foot. The text further explains the anatomical connections between the ankle and the rest of the foot, as well as the lower leg. The tibia and fibula, the two long bones of the lower leg, connect to the top of the talus, forming the ankle joint. The talus is also connected to the calcaneus at the subtalar joint. This connection between the ankle bone and the heel bone is crucial for the proper function and movement of the foot. Additionally, the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, has a cushioning layer of fat underneath it. This layer is essential for absorbing shock and distributing pressure throughout the foot while walking, running, or jumping. As the calcaneus is part of the hindfoot, which includes the talus, the functional relationship between these structures reinforces the notion that the ankle is a part of the foot. In conclusion, the text provides strong evidence to support the idea that the ankle is considered part of the foot. The integration of the talus and calcaneus in the hindfoot and their connections to the long bones of the lower leg and the rest of the foot demonstrate the critical role the ankle plays in the overall structure and function of the foot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As for Gabriella's mom, her role is not prominently featured throughout the three-installment film series. However, it is important to take into account that what makes High School Musical remarkable and well-loved are the main characters and the development of their relationships, as well as their growth as individuals in the context of pursuing their dreams. The primary focus of the story revolves around the lives of the students at East High School, particularly Gabriella and Troy Bolton, played by Zac Efron. Their relationship, alongside their friends, helps to shape the story into a captivating and engaging musical, touching on themes of friendship, love, and self-discovery. The parents of these characters are not central figures in the narrative, thus the character of Gabriella's mom may not be as memorable or even present throughout the movies. Given the limited screen time and less prominence, the role of Gabriella's mom is played by Socorro Herrera, an actress who is known for her work in films and television, such as \\"My Family,\\" \\"Whiz Kids,\\" \\"Resurrection Blvd.,\\" and many more.

Magnets are able to place a force on certain materials. This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces. Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity. Gravity too can cause changes in motion. Gravity holds our moon in orbit without touching it.

Admission to the bar in the United States In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other.

Glass: In physics, the standard definition of a glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching. The term glass is often used to describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. If the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, the structure of a glass exists in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.

Two 'Stop The Violence' activists have been charged with severely beating a former roommate and fellow campaigner after he let himself into their flat to collect his belongings. Nikole Ardeno and Emanuel Velez, both 30, were wearing anti-abuse t-shirts when they allegedly attacked Joshua Magraff as he was walking down the street in Washington, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday about 4.30 pm. Accusing him of burglary, the defendants kicked the victim as he was unconscious, causing him to have seizures and vomit blood, according to Washington police Chief Chris Luppino. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Charged: Nikole Ardeno (left) and Emanuel Velez (right) have been charged with severely beating up their former roommate and fellow Stop The Violence campaigner just hours after a protest through Washington. Ardeno was still wearing the same 'Stop the Violence' shirt that she had worn the night before as she led a march in the city protesting two recent shootings, the chief said. Police believe Ardeno and Velez attacked Magraff because he had gone to an apartment all three shared to collect his belongings after moving out. Ardeno and Velez had come to the police station about 20 minutes before the alleged attack to claim that Magraff was burglarizing the apartment, but police said Magraff appeared to only be taking items that belonged to him as he moved out, Luppino said. Magraff was still unconscious and in critical condition Wednesday at UPMC Mercy hospital in Pittsburgh, Luppino said. A hospital spokeswoman could not update Magraff's condition Thursday because officials there don't release information about alleged crime victims. Ardeno, Velez, and Magraff, are all members of the Pennsylvania-based group. Controversy: Leaders of the campaign group insist they do not tolerate violence and will investigate the claims. Ardeno 'is a big part of that group,' the chief said, and Velez 'is very active with them.' The group's leader, Suzanne Kelley, said she hoped to speak with Ardeno about her version of the incident, but said the group does not condone violence. 'We do not promote violence at all, and I can't believe this is going on. I don't want the community to get a negative effect from this because they back us,' Kelley said of the defendants. Online court records don't list an attorney for the defendants who face a preliminary hearing Nov. 10 on charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, simple assault and disorderly conduct.

Group P had larger logs, while group Q had small twigs, sawdust and kindlings. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group didn't bring solid chunks of wood? Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature.

The following events are explained in their actual order; the original film is presented in a non-linear narrative. The Saeki family lived happily in suburban Tokyo, but housewife Kayako Saeki fell in love with her college professor, Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in her diary. However, her husband Takeo discovered the diary. Believing Kayako was having an affair, he became mentally disturbed and murdered his wife by pushing her off the stairs, snapping her neck to a 90 degree angle and crushing her throat. He then drowned his young son Toshio - who witnessed the act - in the bathtub to cover his tracks, along with the pet cat, Mar. Takeo hid the bodies in the attic and closet, before Kayako's ghost murdered him by hanging him with her hair in Toshio's bedroom. Peter came to the Saeki house to speak to Kayako after receiving a letter from her, only to find her corpse.

His visit, with party leader Nick Clegg, comes ahead of perhaps the biggest year yet for British rugby with the arrival of the World Cup. Scroll down for video. The Business Secretary crashes to the turf during a school rugby training session at Twickenham Academy.

Under pressure: Dressed in a pair of chinos and black astroturf shoes, Mr Clegg tries to grasp the ball. Mr Clegg finds his path blocked as he tries to launch an attack during the session at Twickenham Academy. No way through: Mr Clegg tries to steer a pass through a crowded passage of budding rugby players. Marching on: The Lib Dem leader strides through a gap in the defence, casually carrying the ball in one hand. A confident Mr Clegg, dressed in a tracksuit with an English rose, trots along with the ball in his hand. Mr Cable, Lib Dem Business Secretary and MP for Twickenham, was unhurt in the fall and laughed it off with the young players. The MP for Twickenham later tweeted: 'Great fun seeing @EnglandRugby outreach work in Twickenham getting young people involved in rugby ahead of World Cup'.

The conversation starts with Guillaume asking about Stoke, a city in England, and the two jokingly compare it to Paris in terms of beauty. They then discuss the women in Stoke, with Paul mentioning his sister Kate, whom Guillaume finds very attractive. The conversation moves on to their former workplace, where Paul reveals that their co-worker Tracy misses Guillaume. It is implied that Guillaume and Tracy had a romantic relationship, but Guillaume fell in love with Kate, Paul's sister, at a barbecue party. Paul seeks clarification on the term \\"coup de foudre,\\" which Guillaume explains as \\"love at first sight.\\" They continue to banter about relationships, appearances, and the dating scene in Stoke. The discussion shifts to Kate, who is now living in France with Guillaume. Her French language skills are improving, but she frequently speaks English at her job in a hotel due to American guests. Kate sometimes misses Stoke and specifically Marmite, a British food spread, which sparks a debate about Marmite's taste. Finally, Paul and Guillaume exchange goodbyes and make plans for a summer visit.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Il Mare Context: The story begins with Eun-joo moving out of a house by the sea called \\"Il Mare\\". As she is leaving, she leaves a Christmas card in the mailbox, asking the next resident to please forward her mail to her. Sung-hyun, an architectural student, receives her card, but is puzzled, since he is the first resident at \\"Il Mare\\" and the card is dated 2 years in the future. After a series of back and forth correspondences, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun realize they are living 2 years apart, Eun-joo in the year 2000 and Sung-hyun in the year 1998. After some testing, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun discover that the mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" is enabling their communication and they can pass objects and living creatures through.Utilizing the mailbox, Eun-joo asks Sung-hyun to retrieve a tape player she lost two years ago, which he gets for her. After his father, a noted architect, falls ill, Sung-hyun asks Eun-joo to obtain a book about his father, which she does. However, she succumbs to a minor traffic accident and while hospitalised, the book fails to reach Sung-hyun in time before his father's death. After reading the book, he finally accepts his father's love for him and takes up his architectural work once more.As both Eun-joo and Sung-hyun continue their correspondence, they decide to try a date together, with each person participating in his or her own time. Eun-joo \\"takes\\" Sung-hyun to an amusement park, where he follows her instructions on how to have a good time at the park. Sung-hyun \\"takes\\" her to a restaurant where she drinks a bottle of wine he left for her two years prior. Despite having a lot of fun on these \\"dates\\", they decide that they should try to meet in person.Eun-joo and Sung-hyun plan on meeting in person at a beach where she has always wanted to build a house, two years in Sung-hyun's future. However, when Eun-joo goes to the beach, Sung-hyun doesn't show. She does see a house being built on the beach for an unknown architect's lover. When Eun-joo tells Sung-hyun that he didn't come, he is baffled about why he didn't... Answer:","completion":"At the mailbox in the movie titled \\"Il Mare,\\" a seemingly magical phenomenon allows two individuals, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun, to communicate through time. Eun-joo is living in the year 2000, while Sung-hyun is in the year 1998, creating a two-year time difference between them. The mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" enables them to send and receive letters, as well as objects and living creatures, across the time gap. Through this extraordinary method of communication, they form a unique bond and help each other in various incidents and difficulties. For instance, Eun-joo asks Sung-hyun to find a lost tape player, and he retrieves it for her, while he requests her help in obtaining a book about his ailing father, an esteemed architect. Unfortunately, Eun-joo's attempt to deliver the book is thwarted by a minor traffic accident, and the book doesn't reach Sung-hyun before his father passes away. Despite this setback, they continue to exchange letters via the mailbox and even create a shared experience across the time gap by going on 'dates.' However, they ultimately yearn to meet in person. They plan a real-life meeting at the beach where Eun-joo dreams of building a house, two years into Sung-hyun's future, meaning Eun-joo has to wait until he catches up with her in time. When the day of the meeting arrives, Eun-joo goes to the beach, but Sung-hyun is nowhere to be found. She sees a house being constructed on the beach, seemingly designed by an architect for his lover. Disappointed and confused as to why Sung-hyun didn't show up, Eun-joo informs him of what happened when she returned to her time. They are both baffled by the circumstances, leaving an air of mystery regarding what prevented Sung-hyun from appearing at the beach as planned. In summary, the mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" serves as a conduit for communication and connection between two individuals living two years apart. The entwining of Eun-joo's and Sung-hyun's lives, facilitated by the mailbox, forms the central plot of the movie and leads to various emotional encounters, discoveries, and shared experiences. While they are able to create a bond across time, they are faced with the challenge of bridging the gap to meet in person, resulting in a poignant and thought-provoking narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the context of the description provided, the \\"missionary position\\" refers to a specific sexual configuration between two people and is entirely unrelated to religious activity or missionary work worldwide. The name itself is believed to have originated from a misunderstanding or an ethnocentric view that associated the position with Christian missionaries, but it has no actual historical basis. On the other hand, the term \\"missionary\\" in the context of religious activities refers to individuals, often belonging to a religious organization or a church, who embark on a mission to promote their religious beliefs and values, especially by providing support, education, and religious conversion to communities in need. Missionaries might engage in various tasks such as building schools, providing healthcare facilities, and offering spiritual guidance to those who are interested in their religion. Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate the context in which the term \\"missionary\\" is used.

Summarize: These lawyers work with families going through the probate process to liquidate assets (houses, cars, stocks, bonds, etc.) to distribute to surviving heirs. Getting to know probate attorneys can open up a wealth of opportunity with virtually zero competition in acquiring the property. Most of the time families just want to liquidate assets from the estate as quickly as possible to receive their inheritance. You have a VERY motivated seller in this situation. You can usually use their desire for a quick sale to your advantage by buying the property at a greatly discounted price if you can close quickly. It also helps to have the attorney to nudge them along. As you can imagine, people tend to get a bit irrational and spiteful during the course of a typical divorce. At times some people tend to not care about what they receive just as long as the other party receives even less. There is often a home for sale as a result of a divorce. These attorneys will have clients who are filing for bankruptcy and may be interested in selling their home before or after they file. While unfortunate for the bankruptcy filers, the leads from this type of attorney could be very lucrative. You can also find notices of bankruptcy sales in the local newspaper as there is a requirement to post notice before any sale due to bankruptcy. In addition to handling real estate closings, this type of attorney deals with fixing problems people are having with their partnerships, co-ops, joint ventures, etc. They will also know about real estate deals that end up not closing for a variety of reasons, and you can be right there to make an offer to the sellers.","completion":"Probate lawyers assist families in liquidating assets during the probate process, which presents a unique opportunity for acquiring property with minimal competition.

The answer is:","completion":"The text refers to the category of \\"artist\\". Chiyako Sato was a Japanese female ryūkōka singer, which falls under the field of arts. The mention of her song creations and performances, such as \\"Aoi Susuki\\", \\"Habu no Minato\\", and \\"Tokyo March\\", further emphasizes her role as an artist. The life and work of Chiyako Sato are explored in this passage, including her birth, career debut, collaboration with Shinpei Nakayama, and the success of her songs - all depicting her journey as an artist. Ryūkōka, the music genre she is identified with, is a kind of Japanese popular music that was particularly popular from the 1920s to the 1950s.

Please answer this question: In October 2011 which militant separatist organisation declared an end to violent protest after 43 years?","completion":"The militant separatist organization that declared an end to violent protest after 43 years in October 2011 is the Basque separatist group ETA. ETA, an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, which translates to \\"Basque Homeland and Liberty\\" in the Basque language, was an armed nationalist and separatist group from the Basque Country in Northern Spain and Southern France. The group was founded in 1959 during Francisco Franco's dictatorship with the aim of gaining independence for the Basque region. Franco's regime had forcibly suppressed Basque language and culture, thus providing a catalyst for the formation of groups such as ETA that sought a united Basque homeland independent of both Spain and France. ETA used methods such as bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings in its battle against Spanish and French rule. Its attacks targeted politicians, the police, military personnel, and civilians, and this widespread violence led to the group being classified as a terrorist organization by Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States among others. The death and injury toll from ETA's numerous attacks is estimated to be over 850 and thousands respectively, making it one of Spain's deadliest terrorist groups. The violence inflicted by ETA, together with its lack of successful direction towards Basque independence, led to a decline in support for the group in the Basque country and elsewhere. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, ETA suffered numerous blows with Spanish and French authorities arresting key leaders and operatives, seizing weapons caches, and increasing international cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts. This, combined with dwindling public backing, led ETA to announce a 'permanent ceasefire' in 2010. However, the turning point came in October 2011 when ETA announced a \\"definitive cessation of its armed activity\\". The group declared that it had ended its 43-year campaign of political violence and set out a process for talks with Spain and France. Several years later, in May 2018, ETA went a step further and announced its full dissolution, bringing a formal end to a group that had given up its campaign of violence years before. Although ETA's dissolution was celebrated as a triumph for the rule of law and peaceful democracy, the question of Basque nationalism is far from solved. Many in the region still advocate the cause of independence, but favour peaceful, political means over violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty.

Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): How do a person's heart and lungs change during puberty?","completion":"During puberty, a person's heart and lungs undergo significant changes that contribute to their increased size and capacity, ultimately resulting in improved strength and tolerance for exercise. These changes are essential for the growth and development of an individual as they transition from childhood to adolescence, and they vary between males and females. The circulatory and respiratory systems – encompassing the heart and lungs – expand in both size and functionality. The heart's muscle mass increases, pumping more blood throughout the body to supply the muscles and other tissues with essential nutrients and oxygen. This increase in blood volume contributes to higher systolic blood pressure, which promotes efficient circulation. Lung capacity also grows during puberty, attributed to an increased number of alveoli (tiny air sacs that allow for efficient gas exchange) and a larger surface area within the lungs. These enhancements enable more oxygen to enter the bloodstream and facilitate more effective removal of waste products like carbon dioxide. Resting heart rate decreases, particularly in males, as the heart becomes more efficient at pumping blood throughout the body. This improvement means the heart has to work less to maintain blood flow, resulting in a lower resting heart rate. Males generally experience more pronounced changes in their circulatory and respiratory systems compared to females. They tend to develop larger hearts and lungs along with a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood. Additionally, males have higher blood hemoglobin levels and more red blood cells, which play a crucial role in oxygen transport. Furthermore, males demonstrate greater power for neutralizing the chemical byproducts of muscular exercise, allowing them to recover more rapidly from physical exertion. These sex differences contribute to the overall variations in physical growth, development, and performance observed during and after puberty. In summary, during puberty, a person's heart and lungs change through increased size, capacity, and various physiological adaptations that result in enhanced strength, exercise tolerance, and overall physical performance. These changes vary between males and females, with males typically experiencing more prominent alterations in their circulatory and respiratory systems."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: Too much jogging for elderly people can lead to what?

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects. But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] What is an answer for this question: Which lake had more denser layers of water? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Long Lake had more dense layers of water compared to Shoal Lake. This is because the phenomenon of water stratification, in which water masses with varying properties form layers, was found to occur more often in Long Lake. This implies that layers created by differences in salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature were more prevalent in Long Lake. These dense layers act as barriers to mixing water and can lead to anoxia or euxinia, which are detrimental to aquatic organisms and could explain the decrease in fish population observed in Long Lake. Moreover, the stratification impedes nutrient mixing between layers, affecting primary production in the lake by limiting photosynthetic processes. As a result, the lower primary production can restrict the nutrient availability for phytoplankton, thus leading to a lower net productivity in the water. In contrast, Shoal Lake, which had a healthy and abundant fish population, would likely have experienced less frequent or less intense water stratification, allowing for better water mixing, oxygenation, and nutrient cycling. Consequently, Shoal Lake's aquatic ecosystem would maintain conditions conducive to fish survival, growth, and reproduction. In summary, Long Lake had denser layers of water due to the frequent occurrence of water stratification, negatively impacting its fish population. Shoal Lake, with a healthier aquatic ecosystem, exhibited less water stratification, resulting in less dense layers and a thriving fish population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term was also applied to most Blacks, and persons of color, with some particular exceptions. Jewish people were to be exterminated in the Holocaust. Roma, and the physically and mentally disabled were also to be exterminated. According to the \\"Generalplan Ost\\", the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder, with a majority expelled to Asia or used slave labor in the Reich. A few populations deemed partially \\"Aryan\\" in origin were to be Germanized (see kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany). These concepts were an important part of the Nazi racial policy. While the Nazis were inconsistent in the implementation of their policy, (mostly implementing the Final Solution while implementing \\"Generalplan Ost\\") the democidal death toll was in tens of millions of victims. It is related to the concept of life unworthy of life, a more specific term which originally referred to the severely disabled involuntarily euthanised in Action T4, and was eventually applied to the extermination of the Jews. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A minority group refers to a category of people differentiated from the social majority, those who hold the majority of positions of social power in a society, and it may be defined by law. Rather than a relational \\"social group\\", as the term would indicate, \\"minority group\\" refers to the above-described. The differentiation can be based on one or more observable human characteristics, including: ethnicity, race, religion, caste, gender, wealth, health or sexual orientation. Usage of the term is applied to various situations and civilizations within history despite its popular misassociation with a numerical, statistical minority (Barzilai, 2010). In the social sciences, the term \\"minority\\" is used to refer to categories of persons who hold fewer positions of social power. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Slavs are the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe. They are native to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe, Northeastern Europe, North Asia and Central Asia. Slavs speak Slavic languages of the Balto-Slavic language group.

Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site. - A ghetto is a part of a city in which members of a minority group live, especially because of social, legal, or economic pressure. The term was originally used in Venice to describe the part of the city to which Jews were restricted and segregated. The term has been applied in various contexts. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Officials have already warned there is little chance of finding survivors. It is not certain how many people are trapped in the debris. The deadly mudslide hit the Meeriyabedda tea plantation near the town of Haldummulla, about 200km (120 miles) east of the capital Colombo, on Wednesday morning. Ministers told the Daily Mirror newspaper in Colombo that 150 people were trapped in the debris. The Island newspaper reported that as many as 250 people were buried alive. However Disaster Management Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told AFP after visiting the site on Wednesday that the total was closer to about 100 people. He said that most of those who were originally classified as missing were subsequently discovered to be at work or in school. Correspondents say that compiling a definitive figure has been made harder because an office where village records were maintained was destroyed in the landslide. Mr Amaraweera said that the area surrounding the tea plantation had also been made unstable by the recent heavy monsoon rains and that the recovery operation would have to proceed \\"cautiously\\". One witness told AFP that there was a noise like thunder when part of a mountainside crashed into the tea estate, burying some of the workers' homes in nine metres (30ft) of mud and debris. Mud covered many homes, leaving only their roofs visible. More than 300 survivors spent Wednesday night at two schools near the tea plantation. About 500 military personnel are said to be involved in the rescue operation. Local MP Udith Lokubandara told the BBC that many parents had returned home after leaving their children at school when the landslip happened. \\"It is a very sorry situation because there are many children who have become orphans,\\" he said. Sections of several national highways have been washed away by the rains, reports say. The Disaster Management Centre had issued warnings of more mudslides and falling rocks later this week. In June, monsoon rains triggered landslides in Sri Lanka that killed at least 22 people and forced thousands from their homes. Monsoon rains are caused by winds in the Indian Ocean and south Asia. They bring about wet and dry seasons in much of the region, and have a large impact on local ecosystems. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"A terrible mudslide occurred at the Meeriyabedda tea plantation near Haldummulla, which is a town that's way farther from the capital of Sri Lanka, Colombo. It happened because of heavy rain, a lot like what happens when Mom overwaters the plants and the dirt gets all soggy. These types of heavy rains are called monsoon rains, and they happen in this part of the world a lot. The mudslide was so bad that it covered lots of people's homes, with only the rooftops peeking out of the mud. Just imagine if your entire house was buried in dirt, up to the roof! People are now trying to help find those who got caught in the mudslide, but it's tough work because a lot of mud needs to be moved and they are unsure of the exact number of people stuck. Such disasters have happened before and were just as bad, like in June when the rain caused landslides that forced many people to leave their homes. The people who help during emergencies have warned everyone that more mudslides could be coming because of the rain. So, the situation is quite serious and sad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A US official tells ABC News that Pakistani government officials have told their American counterparts that they soon will get access to Osama bin Laden's three widows. The Obama administration has been asking the Pakistanis for access to the women, who may possess important information about how bin Laden was able to live in his Abbottabad compound for an estimated five years. The three women and the bin Laden children have been in Pakistani custody since last Sunday. The White House has also requested that Pakistani authorities give US investigators access to some of the al Qaeda data that Navy SEALs left behind. -Jake Tapper ||||| After a bit of back of and forth, Pakistan has finally agreed to grant American officials access to Osama bin Laden’s three widows, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN on Tuesday. U.S. authorities will reportedly be given “direct access,” sources say, meaning that they’ll be available for interviews rather than just submitted questions. Malik didn't give a timeline for the talks. But what will the women reveal? The Daily Beast’s David A. Graham breaks down what we know about the various women who vowed to spend their lives with the world’s most wanted man. When Osama bin Laden was shot and killed, his matrimonial life came into quick focus as rumors circulated that he had used a wife as a human shield. That story was soon debunked, but the same young wife aroused even more interest when it emerged that she had been shot during the raid. And in a third twist, bin Laden’s companions have now become more than objects of popular fascination: they’ve come to be seen as potentially valuable intelligence assets. Osama bin Laden's fifth wife. Credit: Rehan Khan / Landov; AP Photo U.S. officials say they want to question the women about their late husband, his life in Pakistan, and who in the country might have known he was there. Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah, the wife who was injured in the raid, has reportedly already told Pakistani interrogators that the bin Laden clan lived in Abbottabad for five years and spent two and a half years before that in a tiny village not far away. But Pakistan isn’t allowing American officials access to them. In fact, it’s not even clear who the women are—but evidence suggests that they are Abdulfattah; Khairiah Sabar, also known as Umm Hamza; and Siham Sabar, also known as Umm Khaled. Information on the three women, as well as on bin Laden’s estranged wife, Najwa, and divorced former wife, Khadija, is minimal. Polygamy is not uncommon for well-off Saudi men, even ones of fewer means that bin Laden, says Madawi Al-Rasheed, an anthropologist at King’s College, London, who has written about Saudi society in Contesting the Saudi State. What’s more, the al Qaeda chief kept his views on marriage—both personal and theoretical—close to the vest, with little mention of them in his public statements, according to Bruce Lawrence, a professor at Duke University who edited Messages to the World, a collection of all of bin Laden’s utterances. In The Osama Bin Laden I Know, Peter Bergen quoted a college friend of bin Laden’s with whom he formed a view of marriage. Their fathers had practiced polygamy, and they intended to do so as well: the Prophet Muhammad had said that as many as four wives at a time were permissible, as long as none was neglected. Jamal Khalifa said bin Laden felt his father had erred in failing to give all his wives equal attention. “We look at polygamy as solving a social problem, especially when it’s confirmed that there are more women than men in the society,” Khalifa recalled. “It’s not fun, it’s not a matter of just having women with you to sleep with—it’s a solution for a problem. So that’s how [Osama and I] looked at it, and we decided to practice [polygamy] and to be a model.” In The Looming Tower, Lawrence Wright quoted bin Laden using a vivid analogy to describe how he dealt with his complicated domestic life: “One is okay, like walking. Two is like riding a bicycle: it’s fast but a little unstable. Three is a tricycle, stable but slow. And when we come to four, ah! This is the ideal. Now you can pass everyone!” “It’s like the sultan sitting there in his harem, although unfortunately for bin Laden, he did not have the luxury.” Each wife had her own apartment or house where the family lived as the family made repeated moves—leaving Saudi Arabia for Sudan in 1991, then transplanting itself to Afghanistan in 1996, and later moving around Afghanistan and Pakistan. Along the way, all but two of bin Laden’s wives apparently stayed with their husband all or some of the time, a rough-and-tumble path of deprivation and difficulty. What do we know about each of his wives? Here are short biographies. 1. Najwa Ghanem: Bin Laden first married when he was a teenager, wedding Najwa Ghanem, a Syrian cousin who was born in 1958, according to her memoir, Growing Up Bin Laden. They married in 1974. Speaking to Peter Bergen, her former sister-in-law Carmen bin Ladin described her as \\"meek, submissive, highly religious and constantly pregnant”—and indeed, she bore bin Laden 11 children. Although she was the “senior” wife, having married Osama first, she was younger than all his other wives until Amal. Lawrence Wright, in The Looming Tower, reported that she was an avid jogger and not well educated, but friendly and especially fond of decoration and aesthetics, keeping her house in Sudan beautifully appointed and seeking out Western cosmetics and lingerie. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Pakistan has agreed to grant U.S. authorities direct access to Osama bin Laden's three widows, potentially providing valuable intelligence assets.

Options: - cook - make tea - hurtful - friendly - hug Explain why a human would choose \\"friendly\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"friendly\\" to answer the question above because when comforting a friend, the aim is to provide emotional support, understanding, and reassurance. Being friendly encompasses a variety of actions and behaviors that show kindness, warmth, and concern for the person's well-being. In this context, \\"friendly\\" represents an empathetic and supportive approach, making it the most appropriate option among the choices provided. Now, let's examine the other options: - Cook: Cooking for someone can be a thoughtful gesture, but it doesn't directly address the need for emotional support and comfort in times of distress. It may help to brighten their day but isn't specifically targeted at their emotional needs. - Make tea: Similar to cooking, making tea for someone can be a kind act, but it doesn't specifically focus on providing comfort and reassurance for emotional issues. It might be appreciated, but again it doesn't directly align with the purpose of comforting a friend. - Hurtful: This option is the opposite of what one would want to do when comforting a friend. Hurting someone, either emotionally or physically, would only add more pain and suffering to the situation instead of providing the support and solace they seek. - Hug: A hug can be a comforting and soothing gesture that demonstrates caring and empathy. However, as a standalone action, it might not fully address the complexity of the emotional support needed by the person. By choosing \\"friendly,\\" it encompasses a wider range of supportive behaviors, which could include hugging as well as offering words of encouragement, listening, or providing advice. In conclusion, the \\"friendly\\" option is the most suitable answer because it encompasses a variety of supportive and empathetic actions that one would use when comforting a friend in need. It focuses on both the emotional and psychological aspects of comfort and reassurance, rather than any single gesture or action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question below: If Milo increases the heat he applies to a resistor, what happens to the resistance increases or decreases? Assuming that: The hotter a resistor becomes the more resistance it has. The answer to this question is:","completion":"If Milo increases the heat he applies to a resistor, the resistance would increase. This is in line with your assumption that the hotter a resistor becomes, the more resistance it has. This principle is commonly interpreted as a resistor’s ability to resist the flow of electric current - this increases with temperature. The primary reason for this increase in resistance is the behaviour of atoms in the resistor. At higher temperatures, atoms vibrate more rapidly. This increased atomic activity can interfere with the flow of electrons (which constitutes the current), creating more collisions when electrons move through the resistor. The resistance is an outcome of these interactions. All these concepts fall under a phenomenon in physics called the \\"temperature coefficient of resistivity\\". This refers to the relative change in resistivity for each degree change in temperature. For most materials, the coefficient is positive, which means resistivity (and thus, resistance) increases as temperature goes up. The actual change in resistance can vary widely depending on the material of the resistor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How to book a better hotel room Asking the right questions could land you a hotel room with a view. (Press Association) Getting a special hotel room can make or break a trip, so here are five questions you should ask to be sure you get the best room possible â or maybe even an upgrade. The key is to get the front desk clerk involved in choosing the best room for you and not letting the hotel booking system choose it for you. You do that by making specific requests at the check in counter such as: Does this room have good wi-fi reception?Thankfully more and more hotels are offering in-room wi-fi for free. But in a world where you frequently “get what you pay for”, a free connection could also mean weak or spotty reception. Since wi-fi is broadcast via wireless routers located in hotel corridors, rooms closest to the routers get the best reception. Front desk staffers usually know which rooms get the most complaints about poor wi-fi reception, so they’ll actively search for a room they know gets a strong signal. Can I get a newly renovated room or one with a great view, a corner room, or a quiet room?Simply asking for any of the above gets the hotel clerk involved in choosing your room. Since these features don’t usually affect the room rate, by asking, you are likely to get the best room for the price. Is there an adjoining room?Noisy neighbours can distract you if you’re working, taking business calls or meeting with clients in your room. This is also an important request if you are a light sleeper. If peace and quiet is important to you, ask the clerk for a non-adjoining room (one without interior doors leading to an adjacent room). Does this room have a large, well-lit desk and chair?Some hotels have desks in every room that are suitable for working. Some don’t. By letting the clerk know that you plan to work in your room, you are more likely to get a larger or better room set aside for business travellers — maybe even one on a special club or concierge level reserved for elite level members of hotel loyalty programmes or those on specially negotiated corporate rates. How much could I pay for an upgrade to a bigger/better room or suite?Most hotel desk clerks are weary of guests asking for something for nothing. But by offering to pay slightly more than your reserved rate, you could end up with a much better room. The amount will vary based on how busy the hotel is, and how many higher tier rooms are available. You’ll never know how much it will cost to get an upgrade unless you ask… so ask! You might be surprised. Have you ever talked your way into an upgrade? How did it go for you? Please leave your advice on our Facebook page.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was said to have \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers?\\" ? The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948–1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989.

In his 30s, Ranjeet is married to Shikha (Shilpa Shetty) and has a six-year-old daughter. Shikha is well educated and a trained dancer. Ranjeet and Shikha decided that she should stay at home and take care of the house and their child. Their eight-year marriage has turned loveless and bitter. Neglected by an indifferent husband and bogged down by family chores, Shikha is attracted to maverick Akash (Shiney Ahuja). Akash is a struggling theater artist who is separated from his wife. Akash and Shikha's relationship starts as friendship and almost blossoms romantically, until Shikha feels guilty and cannot cross the limits that she has fervently guarded for years. Amol (Dharmendra) is a 70-year-old man who has returned to India after 40 years to spend his last few years with his first love, Shivani (Nafisa Ali), who is also Shikha's former dance teacher.

Many banks say that their business is \\"untouched by human hands\\" and therefore safe. But they have no thought that the growing number of computer crimes show they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even if they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there is often no proof. A computer cannot remember who used it. It simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer whose money he had stolen questioned the balance in his account, the teller said it was a computer mistake, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught at last. Some workers use the computer's power to punish their bosses they consider unfair. Recently, a large company fired its computer record assistant for reasons that were connected with her personal life rather than her job. She was given thirty days notice.

The Bests and the Bloopers from the Year in Deals This past year was a big one for deals, but not every dealmaker was a winner, and some wins were a lot bigger than others. The WSJ deals team offers its compendium of the year’s best and the bloopers. But there are sure to be some we missed. Please feel free to add your nominations in the comments. Dodged Bullet. Allergan Inc., determined to avoid being acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., was negotiating this summer to acquire Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a tie-up that would likely have thwarted Valeant’s efforts. But in the due-diligence process, Allergan found discrepancies in the drugmaker’s inventory levels that raised red flags and scuttled the talks, people familiar with the potential deal earlier said. Within two months, Allergan had sold itself at an eye-popping premium to Actavis PLC. Meanwhile, Salix publicly revised its figures, a move that sent its stock tumbling by about a third, as it announced an internal audit and said its CFO was leaving. –Liz Hoffman Bonus Discount. The only thing better than buying a company you want? Getting it for 100 million less. Vista Equity Partners in September won an auction for Tibco Software Inc., agreeing to pay 4.2 billion for the company, one of the largest private-equity buyouts of the year. But due to a mistake in the share count, Vista ended up paying 4.1 billion. Shareholders have sued and the litigation is ongoing. For now, Vista is 100 million in the black: The deal closed earlier this month at the lower price. –Liz Hoffman Slick Deal. When Canada’s Encana Corp. agreed in late September to pay about 6 billion for West Texas oil producer Athlon Energy Inc., crude prices were still above 90 a barrel. Almost immediately after, however, oil prices plunged, dragging down shares of just about all of Athlon’s peers. The timely sale locked in a 2.3 billion profit for Apollo Global Management LLC, a shareholder, more than seven times what the firm spent launching the company in 2010. Apollo hasn’t been as lucky with oil-and-gas producer EP Energy Corp., which counts Apollo as its largest shareholder and whose shares have slid 54% since summer. –Ryan Dezember Good Timing. Carl Icahn struck gold twice with timing. In June, the 78-year-old investor disclosed a 9.4% stake in Family Dollar Inc. and began calling for the company to put itself up for sale. Less than two months later, Family Dollar announced it would sell to Dollar Tree Stores Inc., a surprise buyer. Filings show the deal was in advanced stages before Mr. Icahn’s appearance. He quickly sold out, as the deal had him in line for more than 170 million in profits. Weeks later, Mr. Icahn disclosed a position in media company Gannett Co., again with timing to make others jealous. The company had just announced it would split its publishing and broadcasting arms, and Mr. Icahn’s filing said that was what he had planned to seek. Thanks to the company’s move, the day he revealed his investment he had paper profits north of 30 million, and he still holds the stake, according to filings. –David Benoit A Beat Ahead. When Apple Inc. paid 3 billion for Beats Electronics LLC this summer, it was music to Carlyle Group LP’s ears. Only nine months earlier the Washington D.C. firm paid a bit more than 500 million for about a third of the headphone maker and a small stake in its nascent music streaming business. Carlyle had effectively replaced mobile phone maker HTC Corp., whose partnership with Beats never really panned out, and nearly doubled its money for its timely albeit short stint in business with Beats’ founding pop icons, Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. –Ryan Dezember Fleet Footed. Sept. 22, 2014 proved a defining day in merger history. Companies that closed tax-beneficial “inversion” merger deals before that date got to reap the benefits of their new arrangements, while rivals who weren’t as fleet footed were left subject to a new set of Treasury rules, effective that day, that made the deals less lucrative. Fearful of just such a shift, companies this year rushed to complete the deals, in which a U.S. acquirer buys an overseas firm and then moves for tax purposes to a foreign country with lower corporate taxes. For some companies, such as AbbVie Inc. which tried to buy the U.K.’s Shire PLC, the attempt came too late. Endo International PLC, in contrast, was an early mover, once based in Pennsylvania but now, thanks to February inversion, in Ireland. Endo showed the benefits of its foreign status with a deal this year that brings another Pennsylvania company, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc., into its Irish fold. –Dana Mattioli Plot Twist. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. acquired a 60% stake in Hong Kong-listed ChinaVision Media Group Ltd. in March, just a few months before the Chinese e-commerce giant kicked off its long- awaited IPO process. Then, in mid-August, as Alibaba’s IPO neared, the renamed Alibaba Pictures Group Ltd. delayed its financial results due to possible accounting problems prior to the deal. The surprise raised some uncomfortable IPO road-show questions for Alibaba, whose aggressive dealmaking while working on the world’s biggest IPO ever led some investors to wonder whether it was trying to do too much. Those worries were seemingly washed away a 57% price jump since the IPO. In December, Alibaba Pictures disclosed that an external audit confirmed a lack of oversight by the previous management. –Telis Demos Bad Timing. Small firm Attiva Capital Partners Ltd. in May disclosed a 5% stake in beaten down Puerto Rican bank Doral Financial Corp., calling it undervalued and quoting musical lyrics. Only hours later, Doral revealed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had determined up to 40% of the assets the bank was counting toward its capital cushion may not count. The regulatory decision put the bank at risk of violating an earlier consent order, and the bank said it would have to review strategic plans. The stock fell more than 60% the next day. Attiva stuck with it, adding to the stake while admitting the bad timing. In recent weeks, the firm has continued maintaining, on Twitter , its bullish case for the Puerto Rican economy and the bank. Tuesday, the bank said the FBI had raided its main office. –David Benoit Negative Surprise. When Merck & Co. agreed to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. for 8.4 billion on Dec. 8, the drug giant’s investors cheered the move, sending its shares up in a down day for the overall market. That enthusiasm quickly waned, however, when hours later a judge ruled key patents on Cubist’s top-selling drug invalid. Merck shares retreated sharply on the news and are now down roughly 7% since just before the takeover was announced — wiping out more than 10 billion from its market capitalization, or more than the value of the deal. Merck has said it still believes in the deal. –Dana Cimilluca Missed Moment. In May, Hillshire Brands Co. agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods Inc. for 4.3 billion, an offer generally viewed as a generous one for Pinnacle, a hodge podge of brands including pickles and cake mixes that was majority owned by Blackstone Group LP. Many of the company’s brands are old and slow-growing, and conglomerates had fallen out of favor in deal-making. But before Pinnacle could collect its premium, a bidding war emerged for Hillshire, which ultimately agreed to sell itself to Tyson Foods Inc. for 7.7 billion. Pinnacle was left with a 163 million break-up fee. Though Pinnacle’s share price is up and Blackstone has been selling, it missed its chance at a clean exit. –Dana Mattioli Wrong Horse. The year was rife with examples of bankers who missed out on deals because they hitched their fortunes to the wrong client. In one of the biggest, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lined up with Charter Communications Inc. when the cable company sought to buy larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc. When Comcast Corp. swooped in and struck a surprise 45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable in February, Goldman was left without a role on one of the year’s biggest deals. Goldman did land a role on a subsequent, related deal Charter struck to buy subscribers from Comcast — and it still managed to be the year’s busiest merger adviser by a wide margin. –Dana Cimilluca UPDATE: Pinnacle Foods Inc. was majority-owned by Blackstone Group LP when it agreed to be sold to Hillshire Brands Co., but it no longer is. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said it is currently majority owned by Blackstone.

Question: Where was Grenouille abandoned at birth? Movie plot title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Question: What leads someone to learning about world? - anger - open mind - biology book - smartness - cynicism The best answer is Answer:","completion":"Undeniably, the quest for learning about the world is a complex, multifaceted endeavor that can be fostered by various factors and personal qualities. While anger, open-mindedness, a biology book, smartness, and cynicism might all contribute to one's thirst for knowledge, it is essential to recognize the unique role each of these factors plays in this process. The best answer is not a single factor, but rather a combination of these elements that ultimately drive someone toward learning about the world. 1. Anger: Anger can trigger a desire for awareness and understanding, as strong emotions often serve as a catalyst for change. For instance, when confronted with injustices and global issues such as human rights, the environment, or political corruption, people may experience anger and frustration. This raw emotion can motivate them to learn more about these subjects, discover the underlying causes, and eventually take action to address them. 2. Open Mind: Having an open mind is a crucial attribute when it comes to learning about the world. A receptive and curious attitude toward new ideas, cultures, and experiences allows individuals to expand their horizons and delve into the unknown. It is through open-mindedness that people can foster an attitude of continuous learning and growth, enabling them to better understand and appreciate the world around them. 3. Biology Book: While a biology book may seem like a rather specific tool to learn about the world, it is worth noting that a comprehensive knowledge of life and its processes is one of the cornerstones of understanding our planet and the ecosystems within it. By studying biology, along with other scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and geology, individuals can gain an integrated and diverse perspective on the natural world and the factors that influence it. 4. Smartness: Intellectual capacity, or smartness, can play a significant role in one's ability to learn about the world. A well-developed cognitive aptitude can aid in retaining, processing, and applying new information, which can lead to better overall comprehension and understanding of complex subjects. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that smartness alone is not a guarantee for learning about the world. A blend of intrinsic motivation, curiosity, and determination is equally as significant in driving the learning process. 5. Cynicism: A cynical approach might initially appear counterintuitive when aiming to learn about the world, but in some cases, it could serve as a powerful motivator. Cynicism may arise from doubt and skepticism toward established beliefs or systems, spurring an individual to question the status quo and ultimately seek out the truth. This questioning mindset can foster critical thinking skills, driving a person to unmask fallacies and seek a deeper understanding of various subjects. In conclusion, it is the interplay of these elements – anger, open-mindedness, a biology book, smartness, and cynicism – that drives an individual to learn about the world. Each factor brings its unique contribution to the learning process, inspiring curiosity, reflection, and critical thinking. Ultimately, the most effective approach to learning about the world involves embracing a diverse range of perspectives and qualities, harnessing the power of experience, and fostering an unwavering thirst for knowledge."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you will be presented with a question in Persian.

The novel was a bestseller and won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In 1989, it was adapted as a TV miniseries starring Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall, which won both critical and popular acclaim.

Can we conclude that is the movie lonesome dove a true story? Choose from: *no. *yes.","completion":"*no. The movie \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" based on the novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry, is not a true story. While it may incorporate elements of historical events and settings, and may be inspired by certain real-life individuals or incidents, it is fundamentally a work of fiction. This is evident from the fact that McMurtry wrote sequels and prequels to the original story, further building on the fictional world and characters he had created. The option \\"*yes\\" is incorrect because, as explained above, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is a fictional story created by Larry McMurtry.

Plot title: Zeder Movie plot: In 1956, Gabriella (Veronica Moriconi)âa girl with apparent psychic powersâis brought to the enormous house of Dr. Meyer (Cesare Barbetti) in Chartres, France. Meyer intends to conduct an experiment testing her abilities. He takes her into his basement, where the youngster abruptly falls to her knees and begins digging into the dirt. \\"This is where you're hiding, isn't it?\\" Meyer yells. He rushes upstairs for help from his assistants and leaves Gabriella by herself. She is attacked by something unseen and is taken to the hospital. In the basement, further digging reveals a rotted corpse, with a nearby wallet identifying the dead man as Paolo Zeder. Dr. Meyer realizes that the earth in which Zeder was buried was a 'K-Zone'. In present day Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old typewriter as a birthday present by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the typewriter's ribbon. As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zonesâareas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead. Stefano investigates the message left on the typewriter ribbon. He encounters people who make it clear that they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences. A nearby service station attendant tells Stefano that French investors are building a gigantic hotel on the property, but no work is ever seen being done.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. Question: How does Pres Trump feel about the tariffs?

She eventually gives birth to a larval sac, causing her to go into shock and die. The larval sac is opened by the surgeons to reveal a seemingly normal human baby inside.The baby is named \\"Martin\\" by the scientists.

Martin is just as much of a genius as his father, and Bartok wants him to finish the work Seth started. One day, Martin sneaks into a room where animals are held for testing, and befriends a Golden Retriever. He slips out of his room one day to bring the dog some of his dinner, but he finds that it has been transferred to another section. Martin goes there to discover a new set of Telepods, like the ones his father invented; his dog is being prepared for teleportation.

Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL — North Korea shut down its Punggye-ri nuclear test site on Thursday to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization in advance of the planned U.S.-North Korea summit. The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield. There were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.

A:","completion":"Microwaves and radio waves are both types of electromagnetic waves, which differ in their frequency and wavelength. The energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength. The reason microwaves have higher energy than radio waves is due to their higher frequency and shorter wavelength. To understand this, let's examine the electromagnetic spectrum, which categorizes electromagnetic waves based on their frequencies and wavelengths. The electromagnetic spectrum can be organized as follows from the lowest to the highest frequency (and correspondingly, from the longest to the shortest wavelength): 1. Radio waves 2. Microwaves 3. Infrared waves 4. Visible light 5. Ultraviolet rays 6. X-rays 7. Gamma rays As you can see, microwaves are positioned next to radio waves in this sequence, which implies that they have a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than radio waves. Now, let's consider the relationship between the energy (E), frequency (f), and the Planck's constant (h), which is represented by the formula: E = h × f Where 'E' is the energy of the electromagnetic wave, 'h' is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), and 'f' is the frequency of the wave. Since microwaves have a higher frequency than radio waves, the product (h × f) will be higher for microwaves than for radio waves. Therefore, microwaves have higher energy than radio waves according to this equation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Nemůže mít sex, než dobere antibiotika. Translate to English","completion":"The phrase \\"Nemůže mít sex, než dobere antibiotika\\" in Czech translates to \\"Cannot have sex until they finish antibiotics\\" in English. This statement suggests that someone is currently undergoing a course of antibiotics and should abstain from engaging in sexual activity until the treatment is completed. It is often advised to avoid sexual activity while taking antibiotics, especially if being treated for a sexually transmitted infection or when experiencing side effects that could make sexual activity uncomfortable or unsafe. Additionally, some antibiotics may interfere with the effectiveness of birth control, which could potentially lead to an unintended pregnancy. It is always important to follow the doctor's advice and take all prescribed medications as directed to ensure proper treatment and recovery. Following these guidelines not only protects the individual taking the antibiotics but also their sexual partner(s), who might be at risk of contracting an infection or experiencing complications related to the illness being treated.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s?, what is it ?

Use the following highlights to write an article: Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is believed to be in Yemen. He grew up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He recruited his brother into a terrorist movement. Article:","completion":"Title: Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri: The Infamous Yemen-based Terrorist with Ties to Saudi Arabia Introduction Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, a Yemen-based terrorist, has been in the headlines for quite some time now. His deep-rooted connections, strategy, and involvement in the terror world paint a frightening picture for global security. As a prominent figure in modern terrorism, al-Asiri is a name that deserves attention and scrutiny. This article will provide an in-depth look at Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri's life, his recruitment of family members into the terrorist network, and his impact on the global stage. Early Life and Introduction to Terrorism Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri was born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. As a young man, he grew up in a time when Saudi Arabia was going through major changes, particularly with regard to the government's crackdown on extremist groups within the country. This may have had some influence on al-Asiri's initial interest in terrorism. His first brush with terrorism began when he became a member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - a militant organization that emerged during a merger between Saudi Arabian and Yemeni Islamist extremists. He quickly rose through the ranks of the organization, soon becoming a highly sought-after bomb maker and strategist. Given his expertise in bombmaking, it was only a matter of time before he ventured further into the realm of extremist activities. Recruiting his Brother into Terrorism One of al-Asiri's significant contributions to terrorism was his decision to recruit his younger brother, Abdullah al-Asiri, into the movement. Although much of Abdullah's background remains unknown, it is evident that his older sibling had a profound impact on him, convincing him to follow a path that would inevitably lead to destruction. Abdullah became a suicide bomber and was involved in an unsuccessful assassination attempt on a high-ranking Saudi Arabian official in 2009. Although the attack was not successful, it marked the beginning of an era of violence perpetrated by the al-Asiri brothers, who would continue to play key roles in AQAP. Al-Asiri's Role in Yemen and Connection to Global Terrorism Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri's involvement in terrorism is not limited to his efforts in Saudi Arabia. Believed to be currently based in Yemen, he is responsible for orchestrating several high-profile attacks, including. The 2009 Christmas Day plot, where a Nigerian man attempted to blow up a commercial jet over the United States with a bomb hidden in his underwear, was linked to al-Asiri's bomb-making capabilities. He has also been accused of masterminding the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, where bombs were hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes bound for the United States. These attacks are a testament to al-Asiri's growing influence and reach in global terrorism. Conclusion Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri's journey into the world of terrorism is an important lesson on the dangers of radicalization and the threat that figures like al-Asiri pose to international security. As his reach continues to expand, so too does the need for intelligence agencies to keep a close eye on al-Asiri and others like him. In conclusion, understanding the story of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri offers a glimpse into the vast, intricate web of modern terrorism. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of staying vigilant against extremist ideologies and ensuring that we, as a global society, work together to tackle the scourge of terror both at home and abroad."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Confessed Killer at Colorado Planned Parenthood Clinic Proclaims Himself a \\"Warrior for the Babies\\" Introduction: In a recent court hearing, the man accused of killing three people and severely injuring nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs has openly declared his guilt. Not only did he confess to the heinous crime, but he also proceeded to proclaim himself as a \\"warrior for the babies\\", causing nationwide outrage and concern. Background of the incident: The incident took place in November 2015, when a man identified as Robert Lewis Dear Jr. opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. The attack lasted for several hours and resulted in the loss of three innocent lives, including a police officer, and left nine others seriously injured. It was one of the most violent attacks on the healthcare provider in recent history, and the motive behind the shooting was immediately linked to Dear's anti-abortion stances. The court hearing and confession: During the court hearing earlier this week, Dear appeared to be unapologetic about his crimes. In a shocking confession, he openly admitted his guilt and justified his actions as being necessary to protect the lives of unborn children. He declared himself as, “a warrior for the babies,” representing his strong opposition to abortion and commitment to fight against it. This statement caused a wave of disbelief and shock among the people present in the court, and has since generated conversations on social media and news outlets. Public reaction and concerns: The bold proclamation made by Dear during his trial has sparked a nationwide debate over the divisive issue of abortion rights. While some people empathize with his anti-abortion beliefs, the majority condemns his criminal actions as a misguided and dangerous attempt to force his ideologies on others. Mental health experts have also weighed in, suggesting that Dear's statements might indicate an unstable mental state, which raises concerns about the role mental health plays in such incidents. Implications for Planned Parenthood and the pro-life movement: The aftermath of the attack, as well as the heated discussions spurred by Dear's courtroom confession, has led to increased scrutiny of Planned Parenthood and their practices. While the healthcare provider has reiterated their commitment to legal and safe abortion services, they continue to face opposition from pro-life advocates. At the same time, the pro-life movement has taken an opportunity to distance itself from Dear's actions, asserting that violence has no place in their efforts to protect the unborn. Conclusion: The shocking confession and contentious statements made by Robert Lewis Dear Jr. during his court hearing have ignited discussions on the volatile issue of abortion rights in America. While his actions have been widely condemned, the case highlights the persistent gaps in understanding and dialogue that exist between the two sides of the debate. As the legal proceedings continue, the focus must remain on ensuring justice for the victims and their families."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it.

While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps.

Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.[citation needed] Where does the typical safari hunter hang his hat at night?","completion":"The typical safari hunter usually stays in tented camps at night, according to the article. These camps are often set up in remote areas that are less appealing to the usual ecotourist. The choice to stay in such places is influenced by the nature of hunting safaris which often involve tracking and hunting game in secluded, wild terrains, unlike ecotourism which usually involves observing wildlife and other natural attractions in a more comfortable setting. Tented camps used by safari hunters aren't simply a collection of rudimentary shelters, but are often fully serviced, providing amenities to meet the needs of the hunters. These might include crews who can prepare meals, hot showers, and some level of bedding comfort. These camps can range from being relatively Spartan, with just the necessary features, to very luxurious, with features comparable to those found in high-end hotels. However, despite the level of comfort provided, these tented camps retain an inherent ruggedness, being situated in close proximity to nature and typically in locations far from city life or luxury accommodations. This embraces the spirit of hunting and allows hunters to fully immerse themselves in the experience, while also providing some basic comforts. Safari hunters' patronage of such accommodations is beneficial in various ways. Additionally to providing revenue to local communities, these camps also have the benefit of making use of remote areas that the average photo tourist may find uninviting. This supports regional economic development, promotes wildlife conservation efforts, and supports anti-poaching activities, all of which advocates argue are significant advantages of safari hunting."},{"prompt":"Select from the following.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Jim Norman, 36, a high school history teacher, moves back to his old hometown after accepting a teaching job there. He moved from the town after he witnessed his brother, Wayne, murdered by a gang of greasers in 1963. The murderers themselves were killed shortly afterward by an oncoming train, having parked on the tracks. Jim has nightmares about his brother's murder as he starts teaching in the town. Students that are close to him start to be involved in various accidents that look like suicides. One by one, students are slain so the greasers, disguised as living teens, can return to class. The greasers plan to kill Jim the same way they murdered Wayne to keep themselves out of Hell. They intend to have a child witness the event, leading them to try to kidnap Jim's son Scott. Jim finds out that there is a way to let his own brother return. The gang also needs the remaining living member of their gang, Carl Mueller, who left before the train struck. Jim finds Carl, who panics, thinking Jim wants revenge. He runs back to town, fulfilling the gang's plan for a reunion. The gang harasses Jim's family to ensure Jim's compliance in reenacting the murder. After the gang releases the family, Jim hides them inside a church, which the demonic gang cannot enter. Jim tries to bring his brother back in the church's graveyard as the gang lures his wife and son outside and hold them hostage. Jim finds that something is blocking Wayne's return, and must cooperate with the thugs in reenacting the murder. It also reveals that when Jim was a boy, Jim took the murderers' car keys that lead to their deaths. Jim recovered the keys. He returns to the train tunnel in which the first murder took place, though both he and Carl change their dialogue and actions from those taken 27 years before. Frustrated, the gang leader stabs Carl, which allows Wayne to come back. Wayne distracts the gang while Jim gets his family out of the gang's car. Jim gave the gang back their car keys.

Article: The longest solar eclipse of the century cast a wide shadow for several minutes over Asia and the Pacific Ocean on 22th July, drawing people outside to watch the sight in the sky. Day turned into night. Temperature turned cooler in cities and villages filled with fans of astronomy. The total eclipse could be seen starting in India on Wednesday morning and moving eastward across China and parts of the Pacific. Millions cast their eyes towards the heavens to catch an unusual view of the sun's colorful ring. Cloud in some areas prevented people from fully enjoying the sight. Still, many were frightened. The total eclipse occurs about twice a year as the moon passes between the earth and the sun on the same plane as earth's circle. The local astronomy society gave a flash on how an eclipse happens. Wednesday's event lasted up to more than six minutes in some places. In India, thousands bathed in the Ganges River in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi to clean their souls. It was sunny sky in Hong Kong for the eclipse, where students, parents and the elderly flooded in a primary school to watch. In Shanghai, children climbed up ladders to look through two large telescopes on the school roof to catch sight of the moon moving across the sun. Others looked through a pair of glasses covered with solar filter paper, where they could take pictures of the moon moving over the sun. In some cultures, many old stories are about eclipse. In India, a eclipse was considered unfavorable. In Chinese tradition, there is a story about a heavenly dog eating the sun. As the story goes, people would make noise to frighten off the dog and save the sun.

Pick from: [I] Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of heart disease.. [II] Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of fungal disease..","completion":"Option II is the better solution for effectively watering plants. The overarching goal in this context is to provide plants with the necessary moisture while minimizing the risk of disease or harm to the plants themselves. Let's break down the two options presented and discuss why option II is a more preferable solution: Option I: Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of heart disease. In this option, the first part of the statement that mentions watering plants in the morning is indeed beneficial. The reason being that during the morning, the temperatures are cooler, and as a result, the water evaporates at a much slower rate. This allows for plants to have ample time to absorb the water and stay hydrated throughout the day. Watering your plants in the hot afternoon can result in rapid water evaporation, which may not give the plants enough time to absorb the moisture they need and might lead to underwatering. However, the second part of this statement is misplaced in the context of watering plants effectively. The mention of \\"less chance of heart disease\\" is not relevant to plants, as they do not have hearts. Heart diseases are a health concern for humans and animals but do not apply to plants. Option II: Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of fungal disease. Similar to option I, this option also highlights the benefits of watering plants during the cooler morning hours to ensure more effective water absorption and less evaporation. The second part of this statement is more relevant to the context of assisting the efficient growth and well-being of plants. Fungal diseases can occur due to excess moisture, especially when plants are watered during warmer periods, as this creates a favorable environment for fungi to grow. Watering plants in the morning when temperatures are cooler not only ensures that water evaporates at a slower rate but also reduces the likelihood of fungal diseases. This means that the plants can efficiently absorb the moisture they require while not being put at risk of contracting harmful fungal infections. In conclusion, option II is the better solution for watering plants effectively, as it focuses on both efficient water absorption and minimizing the risk of fungal diseases, whereas option I has an irrelevant connection with heart disease, which does not apply to plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2. 1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, \\"Burning Down the House\\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last. Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere\\"), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and the accordion-driven track \\"Radio Head\\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on \\"hiatus\\". It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \\"Sax and Violins\\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.

If I tell you that Most arthropods have six legs, and ask you the question \\"how many legs do most arthropods have?\\", is the correct answer \\"legs\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"legs.\\" Instead, the correct answer is that most arthropods have six legs. When you ask about the number of legs that most arthropods have, it's essential to provide a numeric answer representing the majority of arthropods and their leg count. Arthropods are a group of invertebrate animals that include insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and others. They all have an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and jointed appendages. These jointed appendages, which include legs, are a major characteristic of arthropods. However, it's important to differentiate between various groups of arthropods, since not all arthropods have six legs. Here's a breakdown of the number of legs in different arthropod groups: 1. Insects: As the most diverse and largest group of arthropods, insects typically have six legs. Some common examples include ants, bees, butterflies, and beetles. 2. Arachnids: This group of arthropods includes spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites. They possess eight legs, which distinguishes them from insects. 3. Crustaceans: Crustaceans are primarily aquatic arthropods, such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. They usually have ten legs. 4. Myriapods: This group consists of centipedes and millipedes, which have numerous legs. Centipedes usually have one pair of legs per body segment, while millipedes have two pairs per segment. In summary, while the majority of arthropods, specifically insects, have six legs, it's important to recognize the variations in leg count among other groups of arthropods.

Women looking to jump-start their sex life may want to spend more time in bed. Sleeping. That's the conclusion of a new study that suggests that each additional hour of sleep increased by 14 percent the likelihood a woman would engage in sexual activity with a partner the next day. \\"Our study showed that good sleep is important for healthy sexual desire and arousal in women, even when women are psychiatrically and medically healthy,\\" said study author David Kalmbach, a researcher at the University of Michigan Sleep and Circadian Research Laboratory. Kalmbach and several colleagues evaluated 171 women, all college-age, who kept diaries of their sleep for 14 consecutive days and reported whether they engaged in sexual activity the next day. Longer sleep time was linked with greater sexual desire the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration said they had better genital arousal than women with shorter sleep time. On average, the women reported sleeping 7 hours, 22 minutes. Other studies have suggested that short sleep time and poor sleep quality lead to poor female sexual response, Kalmbach said. But most studies have been a ''snapshot in time,\\" looking at just one time point. \\"I think these findings suggest that taking a closer look at sleep health in women with sexual complaints is a worthwhile endeavor,\\" Kalmbach said, \\"as poor sleep may lead to sexual problems.\\" Kalmbach said it's not known how lack of sleep might affect sexual desire. But he said it's not simply due to changes in mood, for instance, as the study assessed the women's levels of depression and anxiety. \\"Some previous studies have hypothesized that sleep can affect hormone levels, which may cause changes in desire and arousal,\\" he said. \\"But I think overall, more research is needed in this area to identify the underlying mechanisms more confidently.\\" \\"The message,\\" Kalmbach added, \\"is that sleep health is important for many areas of our daily living. Good sleep has been shown to improve mood, energy, concentration, overall health, and, now, sexual desire and arousal.\\" The study findings were published online March 16 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. Dr. Nathaniel F. Watson is president-elect of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and professor of neurology at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He called the new research \\"one of the few studies to assess the relationship between sleep duration and sexual health.\\" But, he added, \\"you have to be a little bit cautious about drawing any conclusions from this because it is just an association study,\\" and doesn't prove cause-and-effect. Even so, Watson added, \\"I still think the findings are compelling and certainly warrant follow-up with interventional studies.\\" For now, Watson said the take-home message is this: \\"You could add it to a long list of reasons why getting a proper amount of sleep is good for your health.\\" Kalmbach had this advice: \\"It there's anything women or their partners can do to help promote good sleep for one another, whether it's helping out around the house to reduce workload, planning romantic getaways, or just practicing good sleep hygiene, it could help protect against having problems in the bedroom.\\" ||||| The full text of this article hosted at iucr.org is unavailable due to technical difficulties. ||||| Photo A good night’s sleep may be important for a woman’s sex life, a small study suggests. Researchers recruited 171 female college students, who completed well-validated questionnaires about sexual distress, depression and anxiety. Then every morning for the next two weeks, the study participants completed questionnaires on sexual function over the past 24 hours and sleep quality the night before, including how long it took to fall asleep and total sleep time. The study is online in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. In women who were in romantic relationships, each extra hour of sleep corresponded to higher levels of sexual desire, and a 14 percent increase in the likelihood of sexual activity the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration reported greater vaginal lubrication during sex than those with shorter average sleep. These effects persisted even after controlling for age, sexual distress, daytime feelings of happiness or sadness, fatigue and the presence of menstruation. “Getting more sleep should not be expected to magically fix all sexual problems,” said the lead author, David A. Kalmbach, a postdoctoral resident at the University of Michigan. “Sexual problems often have multiple contributing factors, including mood, relationship quality, partner availability and, now we know, sleep health.

Write a title for this article: In the giddy moments after South Korea won the Little League World Series, outfielder Don Wan Sin realized how he wanted to celebrate. \\"I want to go to the Blue House -- the White House of Korea -- and meet the President,\\" Sin said, breaking up his teammates. Just maybe Sin, who scored twice and hit a solo homer, will indeed get his wish to meet Park Geun-hye. He's famous back in his homeland -- along with all of his teammates. Jae Yeong Hwang drove in two runs and combined with Hae Chan Choi, who weathered a late Chicago rally, to lead the Asia-Pacific Region champions to an 8-4 win in Sunday's LLWS championship game. Hwang, who was removed because he wasn't feeling well, gave up one hit in two-plus innings while striking out four. He also drove in his team's first two runs as they built an 8-1 lead before Jackie Robinson West made it close. \\"I'm very joyful. It's a wonderful feeling,\\" Hwang said. \\"I don't know why I'm even here; I didn't play very good today.\\" Choi, who had a homer and scored twice, pitched the last four innings for South Korea, which won its third title after back-to-back championships in 1984 and \`85. But even he got a little nervous at the end after Chicago collected four of its six hits and scored three times. \\"I knew I could allow some runs,\\" he said. \\"After I got the second out, I thought I could do it. But after I gave up the three runs I was (worried).\\" International teams have won the last three and four of the last five titles. Brandon Green went 5-2/3 innings for Chicago, which had survived four straight knockout games before the final. After the final out, a force play, the Seoul team's bench emptied and the players dumped cups of water on their teammates near the mound. The players took a victory lap, waving and laughing. The win meant a lot to the people of South Korea, who had to watch it or get updates in the middle of the night. *By clicking \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. \\"We know the time difference and that a lot of people were cheering for us,\\" said manager Jong Wook Park. \\"We appreciate the people back in Korea. I told the kids that in a speech.\\" The game was played in bright sunshine and temperatures in the high 70s before a crowd of 28,671 at Lamade Stadium. South Korean fans, brightly dressed in flowing satin robes of yellow and electric blue, danced with large fans in the latter innings. Chicago, the Great Lakes Region champions, came back from 3-0 and 5-4 deficits to beat favored West champ Las Vegas Mountain Ridge 7-5 in the U.S. title game on Saturday. Earlier, South Korea, the Asia-Pacific Region winner, rolled over Japan, 12-3. But they couldn't come back against the powerful South Koreans, who asserted themselves early. Leadoff hitter Choi drilled the very first pitch over the wall in right, but a few feet foul. He then flied out deep to right. Sin followed by smacking a screaming liner to center that slipped out of the glove of DJ Butler for a two-base error. Hwang's double brought in the first run. With one out in the third, Choi walked and Sin singled sharply up the middle. After a double steal, Choi came home on Hwang's ground-out to third. Hwang set down the first six Chicago hitters, four on strikeouts. Butler broke up Hwang's no-hitter with a spinning cue shot to short that he beat out leading off the third. That was all for Hwang after he had mentioned to his coaches that he was sick between innings. He traded places with first baseman Choi, who was greeted by shortstop Ed Howard's bouncer to the mound that was scored a single, prompting the first prolonged chants of \\"U-S-A!\\" for the day. Choi then fanned Cameron Bufford before leadoff hitter Pierce Jones -- who had three homers in the LLWS opener but was just 1 for 12 since -- walked to load the bases with one out. That brought up Trey Hondras, who had a homer and three RBIs in the U.S. final, and his high hopper to second on a nice grab by Jin Woo Jeon scored Butler. The rally died when Marquis Jackson bounced out sharply to third on the next pitch. Ji Ho Park doubled and came around on pinch-hitter Jun Ha Yoo's single in the fourth. After Sin pounded the ball over the wall near the camera bay in left center in the fifth, a U.S. fan threw the ball back on the field. Then the Seoul team added three runs in the sixth on an RBI double by Shane Jaemin Kim and Jin Woo Jeon's two-run single. \\"(We) felt like we had a chance even when we were down 8-1,\\" Chicago manager Darold Butler said. \\"(South Korea) had a pretty good game.

Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

He goes to Hollywood where he encounters a number of eccentric characters. He is at first robbed and later befriended by con artist Dr. Sebastian Melmoth (Boyle), and meets a prostitute named Mary (Lasser) who lets him stay at her apartment. Mary grows to care for Ambrose and seduces him while he is taking a cold shower to try to alleviate his lustful thoughts about her. While he is in Hollywood, he visits several churches including a service at the Church of Divine Profit, performed by the televangelist Armageddon T. Thunderbird (Kaufman) in which he sees the focus of the sermon being a request for money in exchange for salvation. Ambrose is angered by this message and tries to meet a number of times with Thunderbird, being ejected each time. Dr. Melmoth and Ambrose travel the city in a modified school bus, in which they hold church services for donations. During one service, the brakes of the bus release and the bus rolls downhill into a river. The passengers escape safely in the river and are shown on the local news being baptized by the pair, which catches Thunderbird's attention. He prays to G. O. D. for guidance and it tells him to work with Ambrose to make more money because Ambrose is an innocent and has a clean image.

He says he will pay Ambrose the 5000 the monastery needs if he assists him. While they are talking, Thunderbird mentions that G. O. D.

Context: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

Castro A:","completion":"Title: Echoes of the Past Step 1: Setting The movie takes place in modern-day Cuba, with a backdrop of political turmoil, social unrest, and calls for change. The Cuban government is depicted as oppressive and corrupt, with its citizens longing for a better life. Step 2: Introducing the Main Characters - Manuel Castro: The protagonist, a charismatic young man and a direct descendant of Fidel Castro. He is a passionate advocate for change and the leader of the revolution against the current government. - Rosa: A young, independent woman who is a close ally of Manuel and a critical figure in the resistance movement. - General Armando: The antagonist, a high-ranking government official who is responsible for suppressing dissent and maintaining the Supreme Leader's grip on power. Step 3: Establishing the Conflict The Cuban people are fed up with human rights violations, lack of political freedom, and widespread poverty. Manuel, inspired by his family's history and the people's suffering, rises to lead a revolution against the current government. Step 4: Rising Action - Manuel forms a network of supporters and allies that rapidly grows in strength, which draws the attention of General Armando and the government. - Rosa, using her intelligence and wit, helps Manuel orchestrate a series of guerilla attacks against the government's forces to weaken their resolve. - The revolution gains momentum, inspiring more people to stand up against the oppressive regime. Step 5: Climax The revolutionaries, led by Manuel and Rosa, organize a massive protest in Havana, demanding the Supreme Leader's resignation. The government dispatches its forces under General Armando's command to crush the protest, leading to a violent and dramatic showdown on the streets of the capital. Step 6: Resolution Manuel and Rosa's forces ultimately prevail, capturing General Armando and demanding that the Supreme Leader step down. Their persistence and valor in standing up to the government inspire the Cuban people to rally behind them and embrace a new era of freedom, fairness, and democracy. Step 7: Final Scene As a new democratic government takes shape under Manuel's guidance, he visits Fidel Castro's tomb to reflect on his family's legacy and the responsibility he carries as a leader of change. With the Cuban people's hopes and dreams on his shoulders, Manuel vows to build a better future for his country.

Summarize this article: Look for all the possible exits in every classroom you have classes in. See how close they are to you and whether there are any obstacles, like desks or chairs, that might slow you down if you have to get to the door quickly. This seems easy, since you walk through your classroom doors almost every day, but reviewing their location will help it become second nature and make it easier to remember in an emergency. If you can evacuate safely, this is often considered the best option for getting away from a school shooting. However, each scenario is different. If you know you can’t run away safely, stay in place and hide. Estimate how far off the ground the windows are to see if you could jump out of them safely in case of an emergency. Watch how your teacher opens and closes the windows, and volunteer to help them to see how it’s done. You could even stay behind a few minutes after class to practice opening and closing the windows quickly. Ask your teacher first, explaining to them that you want to be as prepared as possible in case of an emergency. Escaping through the windows especially good option if your classroom has windows that face the outside and you know, as well as you can, that the shooter is inside. When you get a free moment in class, challenge yourself to think of the quickest route off campus from your current location. Figure this out for each of your classes so you can be prepared just in case you need to make a quick getaway. Do the same thing for anywhere else that you spend a lot of time on campus, such as the cafeteria, gym, or sports fields. Challenge yourself to take different routes to class and to explore areas of campus that you’re not as familiar with. Find the fastest way out from every area on campus, as well as alternate routes in case some ways are blocked off or inaccessible. Look around campus after school or during lunch when you’re allowed to be out and about. In the unlikely event of a shooting threat, your in-depth knowledge of your school can help you make a quick getaway. Once you’ve set up your own mental evacuation routes, go over them in your head every few days to keep them fresh. Your goal is to turn these routes into an instinct, so that you know how to evacuate in case it ever becomes necessary. Your school probably has its own evacuation routes in place for the unlikely event of a shooting. If you haven’t already learned these routes through drills, you can ask a teacher or administrator what they are. Remember that in a school shooting situation, you likely won’t be on your own. You can follow the lead of teachers and other adults who are trained to take care of you in these situations. If you somehow do find yourself separated from the group, your own evacuation preparation is your backup. You can use what you know to make a safe escape. Summary:","completion":"To prepare for emergencies such as school shootings, familiarize yourself with all exits in classrooms and other areas on campus.

What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Gerogije later that year? from the following article ? Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

Store and maintain your pens properly.","completion":"Title: Enhance Your Writing Experience with These Top Pen-Related Tips Introduction For many people, writing with a pen is more than just a simple activity – it's a cherished routine that provides pleasure and satisfaction. A good pen can make all the difference when it comes to the writing experience. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply someone who enjoys putting pen to paper, investing in quality pens, and taking good care of them is essential. In this article, we will explore some of the top pen-related tips and tricks to enhance your writing experience. Discover why buying your favorite pens in bulk, investing in premium pens and inks, and properly storing and maintaining your pens can make all the difference. 1. Buy Your Favorite Pens in Bulk Step 1: Determine the types of pens you prefer It's important to understand your personal pen preferences and identify your favorite pens. Determine if you prefer ballpoint, rollerball, gel, or fountain pens. Each type has its own characteristics and your preference may vary depending on your writing style and needs. Step 2: Find a reputable pen supplier Locate reputable pen suppliers that sell your favorite pens. This may vary between online stores, local stationery shops, or even direct from the manufacturer. Make sure to compare prices and read customer reviews when selecting a supplier to ensure you purchase your pens from a trustworthy source. Step 3: Purchase in bulk When you've identified your preferred pen and supplier, buy your pens in bulk. This not only saves you money in the long run but also ensures that you have a readily available supply of your favorite pens whenever you need them. 2. Invest in a Premium Pen and Ink Step 1: Research premium pen brands and models Premium pens are known for their high quality, smooth writing performance, and stylish design. They often have a better ink flow and finer nibs compared to regular pens. To identify a premium pen that suits your needs, research and compare various brands and models. Read expert reviews and user feedback to make an informed decision. Step 2: Select high-quality ink Just as important as a premium pen is the quality of the ink. High-quality inks ensure smoother and more consistent writing without any skips or blotting. Opt for well-known ink brands and don't forget to consider factors like ink drying time and resistance to smudging and fading. Step 3: Consider pen and ink compatibility Premium pens often have specific ink requirements. Make sure the ink you choose is compatible with your pen, as using the wrong ink might damage the pen or adversely affect its performance. 3. Store and Maintain Your Pens Properly Step 1: Store pens horizontally Storing your pens horizontally, with the nib pointing up or down, can prevent ink from settling into the nib and feed. This can help maintain a smoother ink flow and prevent any leaks or spills. Step 2: Clean your pens regularly Regularly cleaning your pens, especially fountain pens, is essential for their performance and longevity. Schedule time to clean your pens, removing any dried ink or debris from the nib and feed. This ensures that your pens function at their best and prevents any issues with ink flow or writing quality. Step 3: Protect your pens from extreme temperatures Keep your pens away from extreme heat or cold, as this can affect the ink's consistency and flow. Store them in a controlled environment, such as a pen case or drawer, to maintain optimal performance. Conclusion By following these simple tips and tricks, you can significantly enhance your writing experience and create a more enjoyable and satisfying routine. Do yourself a favor and invest in quality pens, ink, and proper storage. Your writing will thank you for it!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, Terry is attracted to Scott and insists that they can keep the secret for the sake of seeing him. She also comforts Ruth, reminding her that she was only at Peralta's apartment but didn't kill him. From Scott's psychological tests and by spending time with them, he discovers that Ruth is kind and loving, while Terry is highly intelligent, insane, and has been manipulating Ruth almost their entire lives.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"I'm glad anybody likes me!\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"From a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"I'm glad anybody likes me!\\" can be broken down, analyzed, and evaluated for acceptability. Determining whether a linguist would rate this sentence as acceptable requires a deeper examination of various aspects of linguistics, including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and register. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the structure of a sentence and the arrangement of words in a grammatically acceptable manner. In the sentence, \\"I'm glad anybody likes me!\\" the basic English syntactic construction Subject-Verb-Object is preserved: Subject: \\"I\\" Verb: \\"am\\" (contracted to \\"'m\\") Object: \\"glad anybody likes me.\\" While the structure appears fine at first glance, it may be unusual to use \\"anybody\\" in this affirmative context. 2. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. The sentence in question appears semantically problematic due to the use of the indefinite pronoun \\"anybody\\" in an affirmative context. In English, it is more common to use \\"somebody\\" or \\"someone\\" rather than \\"anybody\\" when conveying the meaning of the sentence. \\"Anybody\\" is typically used in questions and negative statements. Thus, the sentence could be rephrased as, \\"I'm glad somebody likes me!\\" to reflect a more natural semantic construction. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics deals with the interpretation and understanding of a sentence within its specific context, including speaker intention and listener interpretation. In this sentence, if we consider the intended meaning to be that the speaker is expressing happiness at the fact that at least one person likes them, it would be more appropriate to use \\"somebody\\" or \\"someone.\\" The use of \\"anybody\\" could potentially create confusion or misinterpretation in the listener by suggesting that the speaker is not expressing genuine happiness or appreciation. 4. Register: The register relates to the level of formality or informality of language based on the context and audience. The sentence uses a contraction (\\"I'm\\"), which is generally considered informal. Additionally, the sentence's casual tone suggests that it is meant for informal communication rather than formal writing or speech. Compared to more formal or academic contexts where adherence to standard grammatical conventions is critical, informal language often allows for more flexibility. Therefore, while linguists might raise concerns about the sentence's semantics and pragmatics, its informal register would permit greater latitude in acceptability. In summary, the sentence \\"I'm glad anybody likes me!\\" may be perceived as syntactically acceptable but semantically and pragmatically unusual due to the affirmative use of \\"anybody.\\" However, given its informal register, some linguists might rate the sentence as acceptable, even though it is unconventional.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. To understand electronegativity, it's important first to understand what a \\"bond\\" is. Any two atoms in a molecule that are \\"connected\\" to each other on a molecular diagram are said to have a bond between them. This means that they share a set of two electrons with each atom contributing one electron to the bond. The exact reasons for why atoms share electrons and bond are a little beyond the scope of this article. If you want to learn more, try this article on the bond basics or WikiHow's own How to Study the Nature of the Chemical Bond (Chemistry). When two atoms share a set of two electrons in a bond, they don't always share them equally. When one atom has higher electronegativity than the atom it's bonded to, it pulls the two electrons in the bond closer to itself. An atom with very high electronegativity may pull the electrons all the way to its side of the bond, barely sharing them at all with the other atom. For example, in the molecule NaCl (sodium chloride), the chloride atom has a fairly high electronegativity and the sodium has a fairly low one. Thus, the electrons will get pulled towards the chloride and away from the sodium. An electronegativity table of the elements has the elements arranged exactly like in a periodic table, except that each atom is labeled with its electronegativity. These can be found in a variety of chemical textbooks and technical articles as well as online. Here is a link to an excellent electronegativity table. Note that this uses the Pauling electronegativity scale, which is most common. However, there are other ways to measure electronegativity, one of which will be shown below. If you don't have an electronegativity table handy, you can still estimate the strength of an atom's electronegativity compared to the strength of another element's atom based on where it is located on a normal periodic table. Although you will not be able to calculate a number value, you can evaluate the difference between the electronegativities of 2 different elements. As a general rule: An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move to the right in the periodic table. An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move up in the periodic table. Thus, the atoms in the top right have the highest electronegativities and the atoms in the bottom left have the lowest ones. For example, in the NaCl example from above, you can tell that chlorine has a higher electronegativity than sodium because it's almost all the way in the top right. On the other hand, sodium is far to the left, making it one of the lower-ranking atoms.","completion":"This article explains electronegativity as the unequal sharing of electrons in a bond between two atoms, with higher electronegativity values in atoms to the right and up on the periodic table, and provides a link to an electronegativity table for reference."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Brave Little Girl Stands Up to Bad Man in Court, Wins Big Battle for Girls Everywhere Once upon a time in a faraway land called Afghanistan, there lived a brave little 10-year-old girl. One day, a very bad man did a terrible thing to her. He was an Afghan cleric, which means he was a special man who worked at a place called a mosque, where people go to pray. What he did to her was called \\"rape,\\" and it made the little girl very sad and scared. But this little girl was very strong and determined. She knew what the bad man did was wrong, and she wanted to make sure he couldn't hurt other little girls like her. So, she went to a big room where people decide what happens to bad people. This big room is called a courtroom and it's in a big city called Kabul. In the courtroom, the brave little girl looked straight in the eyes of the bad cleric man and told everyone what he did to her. This was a very hard thing to do, but she knew she had to do it. There were other people in the room too—like the judge, who's like the teacher of the courtroom, and some other grown-up heroes called women's rights activists. They wanted to make things right for the little girl and other girls everywhere. The judge listened carefully to the brave little girl and decided that the bad cleric man must be punished for what he did. So, he told the bad man that he had to go to a place called prison for 20 whole years! That's a very long time—longer than the little girl had even been alive! The women's rights activists were very happy with the judge's decision. They clapped and cheered for the brave little girl and said she was an inspiration to girls everywhere. They also knew that this case was very important for making sure that bad people like the cleric man can't just do whatever they want and hurt others. And now, because of the brave little girl and her new grown-up friends, more people in their faraway land understand how bad it is when someone hurts a little girl like her. So, at the end of the day, their fight for justice was a victory for all the little girls and boys in the land, and together, they continue to fight for a world where they can grow up safe and happy. And that, little ones, is how the story goes, teaching us that even the smallest of voices can grow into a mighty roar and make a big difference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But Kiev accused the rebels of shelling the outskirts of Mariupol - a key port city - from 12km (7.4 miles) away. Meanwhile, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has visited Crimea, which Moscow annexed last year. He said it would be \\"dangerous\\" for ethnic groups to seek special status, seen as a reference to the Tatars who make up about 10% of Crimea's population and largely opposed the takeover. Mr Putin also alleged that Ukraine's government was \\"under external control, with key positions in the government and regions filled by foreign citizens\\". The former Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has been appointed as governor of Odessa while three government ministers are foreign-born. Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko called Mr Putin's visit \\"a challenge to the civilised world\\". The latest escalation in eastern Ukraine has left the ceasefire signed in February looking more fragile than ever. Among the dead were seven civilians and two government soldiers, reports said. Kiev, Western governments and Nato say there is clear evidence of Russian regular troops helping the separatists and arming them with heavy weapons - something Moscow denies. Sartana and Lebedynske - villages on the eastern outskirts of Mariupol - came under heavy rebel fire, the Kiev authorities said. They said two Ukrainian troops and two civilians were killed by the rebel shelling. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Kiev of refusing to demilitarise Shyrokyne, a village east of Mariupol that has seen some of the heaviest fighting. \\"We're alarmed by the developments in recent days, which very strongly remind us of preparations for another round of combat operations,\\" he said.

Clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in treating conditions like athlete's foot. This application should be maintained for 15 minutes daily. Apple cider vinegar, either warm or cold, can also be used, given its antimicrobial attributes that can be traced back to its acidic nature. Historically, vinegar has been used as an anti-infection agent. Next, garlic, known for its natural antibiotic properties, can be used to combat skin infections such as staph. You can utilize two to three cloves of peeled garlic, crushed and mixed with olive oil, castor oil, or manuka honey - all of which possess anti-microbial properties. This mixture should be applied to the infected portion and covered with a bandage, changing the garlic daily. Soaking the infected toe in a solution of Epsom salts and warm water can also be beneficial due to the high salt content that is capable of killing bacteria and fungal infections. This should be done daily, for about 15 minutes or until the water becomes too cold. A soak made of equal parts Listerine and warm water can aid in treating simple infections. This is due to the presence of menthol, thymol, and eucalyptol in Listerine, all of which originate from various natural antibiotic sources. In the case of a toenail fungus, a soak of 50/50 Listerine and white vinegar may help eliminate the infection. However, if your infection does not show any improvement within a few days of attempting these home remedies, or if it appears to worsen, you should seek immediate medical attention. Discontinue these treatments if they are ineffective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Q: Abstract: The possible role of motor development on psychological function is once again a topic of great theoretical and practical importance. The revival of this issue has stemmed from a different approach to the topic, away from Gesell's interest in the long-term prediction of psychological functions from early motoric assessments, toward an attempt to understand how the acquisition of motor skills orchestrates psychological changes. This paper describes how the acquisition of one motor skill, prone locomotion, has been linked to developmental changes in an infant's ability to regulate posture based on information available in patterns of optic flow. It is argued that the onset of prone locomotion presses the infant to differentiate spatially delimited regions of optic flow to effectively and efficiently control the important subtasks nested within the larger task of locomotion, namely, steering, attending to the surface of support, and maintaining postural control. Following this argument, a research program is described that aims to determine if locomotor experience is causally linked to improvements in the ability to functionalize peripheral optic flow for postural control or whether locomotor experience is merely a maturational forecaster of such improvements. Finally, a hypothesis is put forward that links the emergence of wariness of heights to infants' ability to regulate posture on the basis of peripheral optic flow. The paper's overarching theoretical point is the principle of probabilistic epigenesis, which states that one developmental acquisition produces experiences that bring about a host of new developmental changes in the same and different domains..

Answer the following question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had.

Their marriage is toast. Chef Bobby Flay and actress Stephanie March have separated after 10 years of marriage, a source confirmed, following rumors that swirled as the couple spent more time apart. We’re told that Flay, chef/owner of Gato and Bar Americain, and “Law & Order: SVU” star March have been living separately for three weeks and are headed for divorce. “There was a gradual falling apart of their relationship,” a source told us. Flay, 50, and March, 40, spent New Year’s together in Amsterdam, but the Food Network chef then jetted off to LA for six weeks to film a TV show, leaving March behind. When Flay came back, a source said distance had torn them apart. “The couple grew apart, and both are very sad about the split,” we’re told. Flay has been linked to several women during their marriage, including January Jones and ­Giada De Laurentiis, though he’s denied any romantic involvement. In 2010, after Jones crashed into three parked cars in LA, she called Flay to help her deal with the situation. The chef at the time claimed he had only met Jones once before, and “she asked for his number because she wanted to redo her kitchen and gave his number to her designer.” Then, in December, Flay was spotted at dinner with petite chef De Laurentiis at Cecconi’s at Soho Beach House Miami just days before she announced her divorce. “It looked like a friendly dinner,” the source said, but added De Laurentiis “definitely had a few drinks.” Flay explained the outing to us as “two colleagues and old friends had a quick dinner.” March, who launched makeup shop Rouge last year, told Hamptons magazine last summer that Flay’s work schedule made it hard to spend quality time together. “Bobby has sworn to me, like some sort of dating website, we would take walks on the beach, because last year, I said over and over, ‘Let’s take a walk on the beach.’ This time he says he’s going to follow through.” Their reps declined comment. ||||| Bobby Flay and Wife Stephanie March Split Snow Patrol.

The personality is a 10-year old who loves ham and cheese sandwiches, enjoys watching TV, loves orange juice, and is named Arnold. The conversation revolves around the topic of food and meal preparation, and shows preferences and admiration for home cooked meals by his mother. The reply should ideally align with this context. We can eliminate candidate 2: 'Good where do you work' because the nature of the conversation doesn't currently involve career or work context - Arnold is a 10-year old child. Similarly, candidate 4: 'Do you have any hobbies?' is also irrelevant in the ongoing discussion about meals and food. Candidate 3: 'Nice, that takes me back to when I was a kid' could be ruled out because Arnold is still a 10-year-old child. This leaves us with candidate 1: 'I hope I can do that when I grow up, after I am a fireman', which aligns with the context of the conversation (it's about making meals) and is suitable from a 10-year-old's perspective.

Here is an article: In an unusual breach of decorum, even for the divided Congress, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi chased Rep. Tom Marino across the House floor, taking offense at comments by the Pennsylvania Republican during debate on the border funding bill Friday night. “We don’t have law and order,” Marino began as he wrapped up his comments on the border supplemental. “My colleagues on the other side don’t want to do anything about it.” “You know something that I find quite interesting about the other side? Under the leadership of the former Speaker [Pelosi], and under the leadership of their former leader [Rep. Steny Hoyer], when in 2009 and 2010, they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and they knew this problem existed,” he continued. “They didn’t have the strength to go after it back then. But now are trying to make a political issue out of it now.” Off-mic, Pelosi then approached Marino, crossing the aisle in view of cameras, and apparently challenged Marino’s assertion that Democrats did not do anything about the issue when they had majority control. “Yes it is true,” Marino replied directly to Pelosi, who was House speaker in those years. “I did the research on it. You might want to try it. You might want to try it, Madam Leader. Do the research on it. Do the research. I did it. That’s one thing that you don’t do.” Marino then urged lawmakers to support the border supplemental “because apparently I hit the right nerve.” After Marino concluded his remarks and as many Republicans applauded their colleague, Pelosi crossed the chamber again in view of cameras, enraged, pointing and sticking her finger at Marino. She then followed Marino up a Republican aisle, gesturing and arguing with him. Lawmakers on the GOP side gathered in dismay as one spoke out to tell the chair that the House was not in order, in an effort to halt the bickering. Pelosi finally relented after Republicans tried to get between Pelosi and Marino, and she returned to the Democratic side of the chamber. The House then promptly voted to approve the 694 million border supplemental, 223-189. *UPDATE: According to Pelosi spokeswoman Evangeline George, “Leader Pelosi just wanted to remind the Congressman that House Democrats had the courage to pass the DREAM Act – and have the courage to stand up for what the American people want: bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.” George added that “Pelosi accepted the Congressman’s apology.” But Marino’s chief of staff, Bill Tighe, stressed that Marino did not apologize to Pelosi, and will not apologize. “[Rep. Marino] did not apologize to Leader Pelosi and does not intend to do so as he has nothing to apologize for. She was entirely out of line in approaching him while he was recognized and delivering remarks on the Floor,” Tighe wrote in an email. “Her staff’s comment in your story about her accepting his apology in simply not true.” Later, Marino took to Twitter to explain his side of the story. Rep. Pelosi called me an 'insignificant person' on the Floor of the House. I'll ponder that for a while driving to Williamsport tonight… — Rep. Tom Marino (@RepTomMarino) August 2, 2014 …of course I'll be driving myself, with no staff or security. And I'm just a country lawyer who worked in a bakery until he was 30… — Rep.

Write the next sentence in the following story. How to follow the specific carbohydrate diet Talk to your doctor. If you've read up on scd and believe it could provide you some relief from your symptoms, get advice from your doctor on whether scd is right for you. Scd primarily works by starving bacteria in your intestines.","completion":"By restricting the intake of complex carbohydrates, it effectively eliminates the fuel source for bad bacteria and yeast, thus promoting a healthy gut flora balance and reducing inflammation. Before embarking on the SCD, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the diet's principles and the types of foods allowed and forbidden. Also, be aware that this dietary change may initially cause some discomfort or adverse effects, such as the \\"die-off\\" phenomenon – the reaction experienced when toxic byproducts are released from dying bacteria and yeast. In order to follow the SCD effectively, you will need to adhere to these guidelines: 1. Eliminate all grains, sugars, and starchy vegetables: Contrary to most traditional diets, the SCD disallows all grain-based foods, not just gluten-containing ones. This includes rice, corn, wheat, quinoa, and legumes, such as beans and lentils. Additionally, you must eliminate all added sugars and natural sugars, like honey. Be cautious of hidden sugars in processed foods. Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes and yams, must also be omitted. 2. Consume only specific carbohydrates: Fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and unprocessed fats and proteins are the primary sources of carbohydrates in the SCD. Unsweetened yogurt made from SCD-legal ingredients, which is fermented for at least 24 hours, is also a staple on the diet. It must be ensured that all foods consumed do not contain additives, fillers, or preservatives, as these could be hidden sources of illegal carbohydrates. 3. Monitor your dairy intake: While dairy is not explicitly forbidden on the SCD, some people may have intolerances or sensitivities to lactose or casein, leading to further inflammation. Experiment with limiting or eliminating lactose and casein to observe any improvements in your condition. If tolerated, consume SCD-legal dairy products, such as aged cheeses and homemade yogurt, sparingly. 4. Gradually phase in more complex foods: The SCD begins with a strict introductory phase, during which only minimal carbohydrates and easily digestible foods are consumed. As your gut heals and symptoms improve, slowly add in more complex carbohydrates, as recommended by the diet. Monitor your responses to these additions and adjust your food choices accordingly. 5. Prioritize homemade meals and snacks: While it is sometimes possible to find SCD-legal products in stores, it's best to prepare your meals and snacks at home to ensure complete dietary compliance. Stock up on allowed ingredients and arm yourself with an SCD cookbook or online resources for recipe inspiration. 6. Seek support and mentorship: Making significant dietary changes can be challenging, especially when it involves a restrictive regimen like the SCD. Find local or online SCD support groups to share experiences, recipes, and advice from others who have successfully adopted and benefited from the diet. 7. Monitor symptoms and progress: Keep a food journal to track your meals and any changes in your symptoms. Use this information to fine-tune your diet and determine which foods may be triggering flare-ups, and which are soothing your gut. Regular check-ins with your doctor should also be scheduled to evaluate your progress and make necessary adjustments. 8. Be patient: The process of healing the gut is not instantaneous. The specific carbohydrate diet is meant to be followed long-term in order to see significant, lasting results. Remain dedicated and patient, as the time it takes to heal will vary from person to person. Remember, the Specific Carbohydrate Diet can be a powerful tool for alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms and promoting gut health, but it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to determine if it's the right fit for you. They can provide guidance, answer questions, and help you navigate any challenges that may arise during your journey to better gut health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the Fox television series The Simpsons. The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. For inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff referenced a poster featuring more than 320 Simpsons characters. Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film, with 98 having speaking parts, and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people. The series' regular voice actors: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer, as well as semi-regular performers Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, and Karl Wiedergott, reprised their roles. Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, while Albert Brooks, who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as Russ Cargill, after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film. For \\"about a week\\", he was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio, but when the character was omitted from the film, he ended up voicing Cargill. The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005, and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production. James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show's early seasons. Castellaneta found the recording sessions \\"more intense\\" than recording the television series, and \\"more emotionally dramatic\\". Some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted. The writers had written the opening concert scene without a specific band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call. Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the \\"new Grand Canyon\\" commercial with Hanks. Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut. Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice was too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice. Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut. Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points, but these scenes were also cut. Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star. Although he does not provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States rather than then-President George W. Bush because, according to Groening, \\"in two years ... the film [would be] out of date\\". Brooks was nervous about the idea, noting that \\"[Schwarzenegger's] opinion polls were way down\\", and has said that they \\"were [hoping] he'd make a political comeback\\". The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger, but one of the staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainer Wolfcastle as President. This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle. were there other famous voices that are not on the regular show?","completion":"Yes, there were other famous voices that are not part of the regular show.

Earlier today, he was seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John found out that patient A had more LDL, but patient B had more HDL. He now needs to determine correct treatment for them. and a hint : Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.

Answer:","completion":"After closely examining and analyzing the given customer review, it appears that the customer is dissatisfied with the product, in this case, an action movie. The following elements provide evidence to support this conclusion: 1. Title: The title of the review is \\"Pretty Bad,\\" which indicates a negative perception of the movie. This title already gives a clear idea that the customer did not enjoy or appreciate the movie. 2. Over-the-top: The customer describes the movie as \\"over-the-top,\\" often used to describe a situation where things are exaggerated, excessive, or beyond a reasonable limit. This opinion indicates that the action and scenarios presented in the movie were deemed unrealistic or difficult to believe by the customer, which likely detracted from their overall enjoyment. 3. Completely unrealistic: The customer explicitly mentions that the movie is \\"completely unrealistic,\\" reinforcing the notion that the action scenes and plot did not meet the customer's expectations of plausibility. This further highlights their dissatisfaction with the product. 4. Meh: The customer used the term \\"meh\\" to express their indifference, which implies that the movie did not make a positive impression on them. This term is commonly used when someone feels unimpressed or apathetic towards a subject matter. In this case, it indicates the customer's negative or lukewarm response to the movie. 5.

Some reviews: It’s a “bland, humor-free narrative,” with lame references to other movies instead of jokes, writes Glenn Whipp of the LA Times. If the '60s ever come to Planet 51, “we just hope someone writes a protest song about this movie.” The film’s overstuffed creative team—four directors and 13 producers—has produced a “a lame-brained toon that even kids will recognize as an insipid goof on sci-fi conventions,” writes Todd McCarthy of Variety. Actually, kids probably won’t even get the movie, because “Planet 51 occupies the same comedy galaxy as Planet Andy Rooney,” complains Kyle Smith of the New York Post. “Singin' in the Rain references? John Glenn? Cold War duck-and-cover drills? What time capsule yielded this script?” But old-timer Roger Ebert liked it. It’s “not bowling me over,” he writes in the Chicago Sun-Times. But “it’s a jolly and good-looking animated feature in glorious 2-D.” Expand this summary.","completion":"Planet 51, an animated film with an interesting concept of a human landing on an alien planet reminiscent of the 1950s, has unfortunately failed to impress critics and audiences alike. Despite its potential, the movie's execution has been described as bland and lacking in humor, according to Glenn Whipp of the LA Times. The film seems to rely on outdated movie references in place of actual jokes, leaving both adults and children feeling as though they've seen this all before. The 1960s-themed storyline and nostalgic references do not work in its favor, with some critics like Kyle Smith of the New York Post questioning the relevance of such moments in today's context. References to Singin' in the Rain, John Glenn, and Cold War-era drills feel out of place and disconnected from what younger viewers might understand or find entertaining. Another issue contributing to the film's failure may lie in its overly-crowded creative team, featuring four directors and an astonishing 13 producers. As a result, Todd McCarthy of Variety argues that the film ends up being a \\"lame-brained toon\\" that fails to stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape of animated movies. The disjointed creative direction seems to have left Planet 51 struggling to find its footing and appeal to its target audience. In contrast, veteran critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times seemed to have a more favorable view of the film, although he also admitted it did not \\"bowl him over.\\" Praising its visuals and 2D animation, Ebert still finds some merits in the movie as a \\"jolly and good-looking\\" production. However, it is clear that his opinion remains in the minority amidst the wider consensus of disappointment and dissatisfaction. In summary, Planet 51 suffers from a general lack of humor, reliance on dated references, and an overcrowded creative team that has resulted in a movie that fails to resonate with both kids and adults. While some critics may find moments of enjoyment within its visually appealing 2D animation, it seems that the majority of viewers will remain unimpressed by its insipid take on science fiction conventions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The arrest of a Nigerian politician who deposited millions of dollars of stolen money in UK accounts has raised questions about the role of British banks in corruption. As governor of the oil-rich Delta state in Nigeria, James Ibori's salary was only 6000 a year, yet he managed to afford luxury properties, fleets of Rolls Royces, a Bentley and a Maybach, first class travel, private boarding school fees and a private jet worth 20 million. In April, accused of money laundering, Ibori pleaded guilty to stealing 80 million, although investigators believe he may have stolen three times as much. He was sentenced to 13 years. Prior to entering politics, Ibori had lived in London, England with his wife Theresa. In 1990, the pair were convicted of stealing from a hardware store where Ibori worked as a cashier. The next year, he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card. By the end of the decade, having lied about his criminal record, Ibori was governor of Delta State, and was reelected for a four year term in 2003. The Africans looking to make it in China. Although acquitted by a Delta State court in 2009, justice finally came for Ibori in a South London court, after a seven year investigation by the Proceeds of Corruption Unit of London's Metropolitan Police. The unit, staffed by a dozen or so detectives, traces the flow of foreign politicians' money through London, and is funded by the UK government's Department for International Development, which also delivers aid to Africa. \\"We hope that, by tackling the likes of James Ibori, we're saying to those stealing from the state purse, you can't have your children at private school in London. You can't have a multimillion pound house in one of the most affluent areas of London. You can't drive around in top of the range vehicles. We won't let you move money around to buy multimillion pound jets,\\" says unit head Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Benton. Ibori employed a range of methods, some straightforward, some devious. He inflated contracts, took kickbacks, and simply transferred cash out of state accounts. He was helped by his family, wife and mistress, as well as by London-based professionals, who set up shell companies, assisted in purchases and provided false due diligence. According to Robert Palmer of anti corruption NGO Global Witness, London holds a double attraction for corrupt politicians. \\"We are a major financial and legal center so there's a lot of expertise, and there's also a lot of assets that go through the British financial institution, so it's easier to disguise your assets.\\" Palmer believes London also seems like a great place to spend \\"illicit loot\\". \\"There's a prestige about being able to bring your assets and your wealth into the UK,\\" he observes. In March, the Financial Services Authority fined Coutts, a private arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, a record 14 million for failing to monitor three-quarters of its high-risk customers, known as Politically Exposed Persons. Although Coutts says it found no evidence of money laundering, and its processes are now robust, campaigners say London's banks are still playing a role in the problem of African corruption. \\"I think we need to see more sanctions,\\" says Chandu Krishnan of Transparency International. \\"And the greater the severity of penalties, the greater the deterrent effect. And that will ensure fewer institutions would commit these offenses.\\" Palmer has similar concerns. \\"According to the prosecutor, Ibori and his associates had accounts with Barclays, HSBC, Citibank. He had a Centurion American Express card. These are major financial institutions that all took money from James Ibori and his associates,\\" he notes. \\"I think the only way we're going to get serious change is if you have heavy penalties, you go after individual bankers and, in the worst cases, in the most egregious failures, you put people in jail.\\" Is narcotic khat funding terrorism? Prosecutors in Ibori's case were aided by a whistleblower, Dotun Oloko. Although Oloko's identity was accidentally leaked back to Nigeria, resulting in his relocation to the UK, he continues to campaign against Nigerian corruption -- whether it's in Britain or Nigeria. He observes a \\"terrible paradox\\": \\"The international financial intermediaries believe they can engage in this kind of activity, being protected by the same states or the same governments that are leading the same anti-corruption battle.\\" Detective Benton says although British banks do cooperate with his unit, tracing the sources of money can still be difficult, particularly without international cooperation. \\"They may have accrued legitimate wealth. They may have had family interests in businesses. What you are trying to do is look at a pot of money and go, 'What is legitimate and what isn't?' and that can be very, very, difficult. A spokesperson from the Proceeds of Corruption Unit said Ibori's embezzled assets will be confiscated and repatriated to their rightful owners -- the people of the Delta State. \\"It is always rewarding for anyone working on a proceeds of corruption case to know that the stolen funds they identify will eventually be returned to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world.\\"","completion":"1.

Article: Wearing ties was originally the mark of Britain's most powerful classes, which made the tie itself a symbol of power and respect. And that led it to be adopted by a much larger tribe--the business tribe. You cannot wear a tie if you work with machinery. So wearing a tie became a sign that you were a man who used your brain to make a living, rather than your hands. It showed you were serious. It showed you were a professional. It meant that everyone who wanted a job in business had to wear one. It was just impossible to take seriously a man who didn't wear a piece of color1ed silk around his neck. This is how millions of people came to be wearing ties across the world. They are part of the uniform of business. \\"Ties offer a point of indifference,\\" says John Milne, head of the British Guide of Tie Makers. \\"They give a chance to say something about their own personality.\\" So if you happen to meet a man with a very brightly color1ed tie, there is a good chance that he is the office joker. There is also a good chance that he will be wearing brightly color1ed socks. Is there a future for ties? The signs are not promising. Tie wearing seems to be rare among the new bread of entrepreneurs in the Internet and new technology industries. Many political leaders,including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, now go without ties. This shows they are men of the people--but not the people wearing ties. Up until around 1960, it was common for men across the Western world to wear hats as part of their business uniform. That changed with the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency of the United States. Kennedy never wore a hat in fact his nickname was\\"hatless Jack\\". Seeing that the most powerful man in the world did not have to wear a hat, millions of other men decided that they did not have to, either. Hats simply vanished across the Western world. Perhaps\\"tieless Tony\\"(UK Prime Minister Tony Blair) will have the same effect as \\"hatless Jack\\". Question: The writer may hold the opinion that _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"The writer may hold the opinion that the future of ties is uncertain and their popularity may decline, similar to how hats disappeared from the mainstream business attire after John F. Kennedy chose not to wear them. This is suggested by the decrease in tie-wearing among new entrepreneurs in technology industries and political leaders like British Prime Minister Tony Blair."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

ProMotion allowed for a refresh rate of 120Hz, doubling the conventional 60Hz in most other tablets, resulting in fluid scrolling and more responsive inputs. Another significant improvement was the inclusion of the A10X Fusion chip, a step up from the A9X chip used in the first generation. This, combined with an embedded M10 coprocessor, translated to faster and more efficient processing and graphics performance. The iPad Pro second generation also came with better camera capabilities, featuring a 12MP rear camera and a 7MP front camera, also supporting 4K video recording. Additionally, these models featured a more refined four-speaker audio system. On the software front, these devices first shipped with iOS 10. However, later that year, with the release of iOS 11, the iPad Pro Series received some iPad-specific features to improve multitasking and productivity. These included Files, a central place for all files; Dock, an easy access to favorite and frequently used apps and documents; and Drag and Drop feature for moving text, photos, and files from app to app. In terms of availability, the second-generation iPad Pro’s were made available pretty soon after their announcement. Apple started taking pre-orders on June 5, 2017, and the devices hit the stores a week later on June 13, 2017, in the USA. Hence, the launch of the second-generation iPad Pro didn’t merely represent a product upgrade. It was a strategic move by Apple to create a more powerful device targeted toward professional users who require more robust capabilities than the traditional iPad could provide. This demonstrated Apple's commitment to producing dynamic, high-end devices for all types of users, from casual to professional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Coleco Industries Inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at 65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders. Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about 430 million, would receive about 92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments, about 225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged. But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit 600 million in 1985. But as the craze died, Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988. The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court.

On the other hand, a garbage bag is not a reasonable choice because it's intended for holding larger amounts of waste, not for containing liquids.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Answer: The conducting zone and the respiratory stuffers (but not the alveoli) are made up of airways . Question: how many lungs does a human have The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the conducting zone and the respiratory structures (excluding the alveoli) consist of airways that help transport air in and out of the lungs. However, the original question asked about the number of lungs a human has, and the answer to that question is: a human has two lungs, the right lung and the left lung. The human respiratory system plays a vital role in the exchange of gases between the body and the environment. The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during the process of breathing. The lungs, located within the thoracic cavity, are protected by the ribcage and are separated by the mediastinum, a central cavity that contains the heart and other vital organs. The left and right lungs differ slightly in size and shape, with the left lung being marginally smaller to accommodate the heart's position in the chest. The left lung has two lobes, superior and inferior, while the right lung has three lobes: superior, middle, and inferior. These lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments, which are functionally and anatomically distinct units within the lungs. The respiratory system can be divided into two primary regions: the conducting zone and the respiratory zone. The conducting zone consists of airways that carry air into and out of the lungs, such as the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. These structures help warm, filter, and moisten the incoming air before it reaches the respiratory zone. The respiratory zone is where the actual gas exchange occurs, featuring structures like respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and most importantly, the alveoli. The alveoli are tiny sacs surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, allowing for efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between the air and the bloodstream. In conclusion, while the airways play a crucial role in the respiratory system, the core of your original question is about the number of lungs a human possesses. Humans have two lungs - the left and the right - which facilitate the essential gas exchange needed to support life functions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: The New York City Board of Health unanimously approved a mandate Wednesday requiring all children under 5 enrolled in city-licensed preschools and day cares to receive the flu vaccine. It is one of outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's final health initiatives, which the New York City Department of Health proposed to the Board of Health in September. \\"Young children have a high risk of developing severe complications from influenza,\\" the Health Department said in a statement. \\"One-third of children under five in New York City do not receive an annual influenza vaccination, even though the vaccine safely and effectively protects them against influenza illness. Young children often pass influenza to other children and family members, who then spread the infection to others in the community.\\" The flu vaccine will be added to the seven other vaccines children under 5 are required to get, including measles, whooping cough and chicken pox. \\"We know that influenza is a serious illness which affects an estimated 15% to 40% of children during annual flu season,\\" said Dr. Jay Varma, who oversees infectious diseases as deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department. Richard Kanowitz, president of Families Fighting Flu, lost his daughter at age 4 to the virus. \\"This is great news for children,\\" he said. \\"Had the same law been in effect when my daughter was alive in 2004, she'd be alive today. She would not have gotten the flu.\\" \\"Only 60 percent of children under the age of 5 in New York City get vaccinated,\\" Dr. Varma said. \\"In New Jersey and Connecticut, where they have this requirement, it's 80%.\\" The issue of vaccinating children is controversial.

The New York City Board of Health has unanimously approved a mandate requiring all children under 5 enrolled in city-licensed preschools and day cares to receive the flu vaccine. 2. This move is one of outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's final health initiatives and was proposed by the New York City Department of Health in September. 3. The Health Department highlighted the high risk of severe complications faced by young children from influenza and the current low vaccination rate of one-third of children under 5 in New York City. 4. The flu vaccine will join seven other required vaccines for young children, such as measles, whooping cough, and chicken pox. 5.

Abner Doubleday (June 26, 1819 - January 26, 1893) was a career United States Army officer and Union general in the American Civil War. He fired the first shot in defense of Fort Sumter, the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg. Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade caused lasting enmity between the two men. Although Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, he is more widely known as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball, in Elihu Phinney's cow pasture in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839. The Mills Commission, chaired by Abraham G. Mills, the fourth president of the National League, was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that \\"the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.\\" It concluded by saying, \\"in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday's fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army.\\" However, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a \\"myth\\". He wrote, \\"Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\\" At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game, and his New York Times obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life. Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839. Despite the lack of solid evidence linking Doubleday to the origins of baseball, Cooperstown, New York became the new home of what is today the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1937. There may have been some relationship to baseball as a national sport and Abner Doubleday. While the modern rules of baseball were formulated in New York during the 1840s, it was the scattering of New Yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country, that spread not only baseball, but also the \\"New York Rules\\", thereby harmonizing the rules, and being a catalyst for its growth. Doubleday was a high-ranking officer, whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states. For the morale of the men, he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the men. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he invent baseball?","completion":"The article states that the Mills Commission claimed Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Elihu Phinney's cow pasture in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.

The Russian ambassador to the UK hailed his Labour leadership victory as the most \\"radical breakthrough in British politics\\" in 30 years. Top officials in the US administration were reportedly aghast when they looked closely at some of his past positions. And UK Prime Minister David Cameron told the Conservative Party conference: \\"We cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love.\\" But how radical a shift for the Labour Party does Mr Corbyn represent when it comes to key foreign policy issues? Initially his position on whether to stay in the EU or leave was ambiguous. Mr Corbyn said he wanted a Europe that did more for social and environmental protections and not just the free market. He lambasted the EU's talks with the US over a new Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as \\"secret negotiations\\" that would \\"sign away\\" many public services. He said he had mixed feelings about the upcoming EU referendum and hinted he might not campaign to stay in. But later he clarified that he could not foresee Labour under his leadership campaigning to leave the EU, and he used his conference speech to call for a \\"vision of social Europe\\" to protect workers' rights and offer more help to refugees. His shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, went further, declaring unequivocally that \\"Britain's future lies in Europe\\", the coming EU referendum was the most important decision for 40 years for Britain's place in the world, and there would be a Labour campaign to stay in. In the past, Mr Corbyn has called for Britain to pull out of the Nato alliance and scrap its Trident nuclear deterrent, dismissing both as outdated relics from the Cold War. Since becoming party leader he has backtracked on leaving Nato, but his personal opposition to Trident remains strong. However, not everyone, including his own deputy leader, agrees with him. In a blow to his leadership, trade union leaders (concerned about defence jobs) blocked a vote at Labour's conference on whether to scrap Trident. Instead, the conference voted to keep Labour's official position in support of a \\"continuous at-sea deterrent\\" - in other words, maintaining Trident. Mr Corbyn has said he will continue to try to persuade colleagues to change their minds. Criticism of Nato has also coloured the Labour leader's attitude towards Russia's role over the past two years in Ukraine. He has argued the \\"hypocrisy of the West\\" and the eastward expansion of Nato was partly to blame for provoking the conflict in Ukraine, though he admits that Russia violated Ukraine's sovereignty by taking over Crimea. More recently as Labour Party leader, he has said he is \\"not an admirer of Putin's foreign policy\\". But his bottom-line position is that it is better to reach out through diplomacy to \\"talk to everyone\\" (even groups like Hamas and Hezbollah) rather than promote further confrontation and bloodshed through military options. Mr Corbyn has consistently been opposed to \\"military interventions\\" on principle, including what he has called the \\"disaster\\" of the 2003 Iraq invasion. He has even suggested the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair could end up facing a war crimes tribunal for his part in leading the country into what Mr Corbyn says was an illegal war. He has said he will oppose any new vote in Parliament for air strikes against the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria as well as Iraq, because bombing would only make IS militants stronger. Instead, he has argued for isolating the jihadists through collective diplomacy involving all Syria's neighbours and Russia. But this is another issue that divides Labour MPs, some of whom have indicated they might defy him to side with the government if it pushed for a vote to approve UK air strikes in Syria as well as Iraq. And since Russia has begun its own bombing campaign in Syria, Mr Corbyn has not made clear whether he is prepared to condemn \\"military intervention\\" in the Syria conflict by Russia as well. Overall, Mr Corbyn says the country needs a \\"radically different foreign policy\\", including standing up for human rights instead of selling weapons to repressive regimes, more international collaboration, and \\"clever, patient, difficult\\" diplomacy rather than military interventions. But at the same time, in his conference speech he called for \\"strong modern military and security forces\\" to keep Britain safe, and for jobs in the defence industry to be protected. And not everyone on Labour's shadow front bench shares their new leader's positions. Mr Corbyn embraces that difference of opinion as a strength, saying that airing diverse views within the party and not always agreeing on everything is part of his \\"new politics\\". But it means that how far his past personal radicalism will translate into party positions remains unclear. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The text talks about a politician named Mr. Corbyn who has become the leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. His ideas about foreign policy are different from what the party has believed in before. Some people like that he has new ideas, but others are worried about the changes he might bring. Mr. Corbyn wants to focus on talking and working together with other countries instead of fighting with them. He has changed his mind about some things, like being a part of NATO and the European Union, but he still has strong opinions about not using nuclear weapons and not getting involved in wars.

Undertaken between June 1840 and November 1841, this revolt was led by Apolinario de la Cruz, otherwise known as \\"Hermano Pule\\". De la Cruz started his own religious order, the Confraternity of Saint Joseph in Lucban, located in the present-day province of Quezon , in June 1840. However, there were two types of priests in the Philippines then: secular priests, or parish priests, which were usually Indio, and religious priests, or convent priests, which were usually Spanish. Due to the concentration of Spanish religious power and authority in the already-established religious orders and the concept that Filipino priests should only stay in the church and not the convent and vice versa , the Spanish government banned the new order, especially due to its deviation from original Catholic rituals and teachings, such as prayers and rituals suited for Filipinos.However, thousands of people in Tayabas, Batangas, Laguna and even Manila already joined. Because of this, the Spanish government sent in troops to forcibly break up the order, forcing De la Cruz and his followers to rise in armed revolt in self-defense. Many bloody battles were fought with the order's last stand in Mount San Cristobal, near Mount Banahaw, in October 1841. The Spaniards eventually won, and Apolinario de la Cruz was executed on November 4, 1841 in the then-provincial capital, Tayabas.

This can be checked against databases kept by the government. \\"The information will be locked into the card so that people won' t be able to use false identities,\\" said Ren Tianbu, a security official in Shenyang. China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry date and number. Germany, France and Spain all use ID cards, but there are some developed nations who dislike the idea. The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses. For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence to identify people. Identity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons.

Question: \\"__ territory was inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people.\\" Context: \\"According to a study by Dr. Paul Brest, Hispanics or \\"Latinos\\" include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising Central and South America. In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty. They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990. In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors's degrees awarded. At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \\"white\\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.\\" Answer:","completion":"The territory mentioned in the question, which was inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people, refers to the islands in the Caribbean region, specifically Puerto Rico, Cuba, Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti), and Jamaica. The Ciboney Taíno people were an indigenous group that inhabited the Caribbean, prior to European colonization. The Taínos were known for their advanced agricultural practices, fishing, and craftsmanship. They built their communities typically close to water sources, such as rivers or the coast, to facilitate their fishing and navigation activities. Moreover, they had established a sophisticated social and political organization within their communities, known as cacicazgos, which were led by caciques – the Taíno chieftains. However, following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, European colonization led to a decline in the Taíno population due to diseases brought by the Europeans, enslavement, and other brutalities inflicted upon the indigenous people. Later on, the Taíno culture and population were further diluted as a consequence of intermarriage and cultural assimilation with European settlers and Africans brought to the Caribbean as slaves. Regarding the context provided, it illustrates the historical background and current conditions of various Latino groups in the United States, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans. These three groups made up 80% of the Latino population in the country by 1991. Despite their common cultural heritage and shared ancestral roots with the indigenous people of Latin America, such as the Ciboney Taíno people, Latinos in the United States have faced significant challenges regarding social and economic inequalities. Discrimination, poverty levels, and access to education are significant issues that have disproportionally affected Latinos in comparison to White Americans. Between 1975 and 1990, the high school completion rate for Latinos dropped by 3%, whereas the rate for African Americans increased by 12%. Additionally, in 1990, Latinos comprised 9% of the total population but only received 3.1% of the bachelor's degrees awarded. The categorization of Latinos has been inconsistent, as they were considered \\"white\\" during the Reconstruction when it was convenient but labeled as an inferior race in other cases, demonstrating the continuous struggle for inclusion and recognition in American society. Furthermore, persistent negative stereotypes have plagued the Latino community, as many individuals are perceived as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" This further highlights the marginalization they face in various areas, such as employment, housing, and education. In conclusion, the territory inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people, who are connected ancestrally to modern Latino populations, holds great historical significance when understanding the experiences and challenges faced by Latinos in the United States today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Accused: Bobby and Moira Roberts have been charged with animal cruelty after secret footage revealed they allowed their elephant to be beaten (file picture) The former owners of Britain’s last circus elephant instructed workers to keep her chained up and let a groom beat her, a court heard yesterday. Anne the elephant was kept tethered for days with only a scattering of straw and displayed behaviour caused by stress, it was alleged. Prosecutor Helen Law said Anne, who already had arthritis, rocked backwards and forwards which, as in humans, is a sign of distress. At other times her leg buckled under her. Her suffering was described on the first day of the trial of Bobby and Moira Roberts who are accused of animal cruelty. They run Bobby Roberts Super Circus and Anne, a 59-year-old from Sri Lanka, started working for Mr Roberts back in 1957. Her plight was captured in covert footage obtained by campaign group Animal Defenders International which placed a camera in the barn at the circus’ winter quarters where Anne was kept when not on tour. As well as being chained to the ground by one front and one hind leg, it showed she was hit with various tools including a pitchfork by one of the Roberts’ employees. Neither of the Roberts is accused of hitting Anne themselves but they are charged with failing to take reasonable steps to prevent her being hit by their staff. Miss Law told Northampton Magistrates’ Court that the grooms were ‘plainly inadequately trained’ and one clip from the footage showed Bobby Roberts kicking Anne’s trunk in front of a worker. ‘Bobby Roberts was happy to legitimise the use of casual violence on this elephant,’ she said.Other clips showed Anne being kicked and hit on the flank with a pitchfork by a worker.' After the footage was first made public. in the Daily Mail last year, police and the RSPCA visited the site in. Polebrook, Cambridgeshire, and found Anne’s environment had been. significantly altered. Circus: Anne was kept her chained up for 24-hours-a-day and only un-shackled so they could swap which leg she was chained with, a court heard. New life: Anne now lives at Longleat in a giant paddock with its own sandpit for her to play in (pictured) Fragile: Anne is 58 and video shown to the jury included footage of her being kicked and poked. Allegations: The prosecution say Bobby Roberts would boot Anne in the trunk. She was unchained and in an area of. the barn deep with straw and cordoned off by an electric fence. Miss Law. said this was because the Roberts knew keeping her chained was ‘not. permissible under the required standards’. But the RSPCA was still concerned. Anne was not receiving appropriate medication for arthritis which she. was diagnosed with in 2003, the court heard. The owners agreed to hand. over the elephant to Longleat Wildlife Park. Bobby Roberts, 69, claims he instructed the groom only to keep Anne chained at certain times and to let her go outside when the weather was good. Moira Roberts, 73, claims to have had nothing to do with the elephant’s care. The Roberts, of Oundle, Northamptonshire, each deny causing unnecessary suffering to Anne, failing to prevent employee Nicolai Nitu from causing her suffering, and failing to ensure her needs were met. The groom is thought to have fled to his native Romania. The case continues. Watch the whole film here. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

G.O.P.âs Hopes to Take Senate Are Dimming Then the government shut down. Now, instead of sharpening their attacks on Democrats, Republicans on Capitol Hill are being forced to explain why they are not to blame and why Americans should trust them to govern both houses of Congress when the one they do run is in such disarray. Complicating the prospects, the grass-roots political force that has provided so much of the energy for conservative victories over the last four years â the Tea Party â is aggressively working against Republicans it considers not conservative enough. As a result, many Republicans are openly worrying that the fallout from the fiscal battles paralyzing the capital will hit hardest not in the House, which seems safely in Republican hands thanks to carefully redrawn districts, but in the Senate. Republican infighting, they say, has given Democrats the cover they need to deflect blame and keep their majority. âThe Tea Party benefits when the energy is focused on the Democratic Party and their agenda,â said Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant and former strategist for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. âWhatâs concerning is a select few groups trying to turn that fire inward on the Republican Party. And that is not helpful.â In states like Georgia, Louisiana and Montana, the members of the House who are now running for the Senate are demanding that Mr. Obama make concessions on the health care law in exchange for reopening the government. That might help in a Republican primary, but it puts the candidates at risk of damaging their viability in the general election. And in other states like Kentucky, where the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, is fighting off a primary challenge from the Tea Party right and would face a strong Democratic opponent, being associated with Republicans in Washington is as freighted as it has ever been. Mr. McConnellâs newest advertisement, in fact, adopts the grievances as his own. âAngry with Washington? So am I,â says Mr. McConnell, a 28-year veteran of the Senate. Many Republicans fear that if Mr. McConnellâs opponent wins the nomination, the seat will flip to the Democrats. With the elections still a year away, it is impossible to tell what other factors might alter the field. But Republicans, Democrats and independent experts all agree that the government shutdown has added one more cross for Republicans to bear. âIf I were running for the U.S. Senate, would I want to be running from Washington? No,â said Charlie Cook, the editor of The Cook Political Report, which tracks Congressional races. âAnd if I were running from Washington, would I want to be running from the House Republican side? No.â The Republicans have little margin of error. A new analysis by Cook Political showed how difficult the math was. The party would need to win five of the six Senate seats considered most competitive to recapture a majority. All six of those seats are in states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, but as Mr. Cook put it, âThe path is very, very, very narrow.â Nowhere are Republican candidates more saddled with baggage from their day jobs in the House than in Georgia, where three members are among those vying for the Senate nomination. Two of the candidates, Representatives Phil Gingrey and Paul Broun, have among the most conservative voting records in the House, and the third, Representative Jack Kingston, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, has a reputation for being far less ideological. In an interview last week, Mr. Kingston objected to his opponentsâ premise that the primary fight was forcing him to be more rigid about the shutdown than he ordinarily would be. He said he was not even remotely centrist. âWait a minute, wait a minute,â he said with a wide grin on his face as he checked off the conservative organizations that had given him high marks. âOne hundred percent National Right to Life. A-plus N.R.A. Ninety-five percent lifetime with the American Conservative Union. And Iâm the moderate?â He said he would side with his more conservative colleagues to defund the health care law or shut the government even if he were not running for the Senate. âTo the degree that going through short-term sacrifice to change the long-term spending pattern of America, it seems to be the only way to get things done in this environment,â he said. A fourth Senate candidate, Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, is trying to use her distance from Washington Republicans as an advantage. In a new ad, she notes that her three opponents have a combined four decades in Washington. âTheir experience is expensive, and the truth is they are the problem,â she says. In Louisiana and Montana, which have a history of electing moderate Democrats to the Senate, the likely Republican nominees are House members who have aligned themselves with the conservatives who are vowing to keep the government closed until Mr. Obama agrees to changes in the health care law. In Montana, Democrats have piled on Representative Steve Daines, a first-term congressman who is expected to run for the seat being vacated by Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat who was first elected in 1978. They have sought to portray Mr. Daines, who signed on to the effort not to vote for a budget until the health care law is stripped of its financing, as a pawn of Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who has led the defunding campaign on Capitol Hill. The Republican candidate in Louisiana, Representative Bill Cassidy, is a three-term veteran who despite having a 92 percent rating from the American Conservative Union has been attacked by some on the right for supporting health care reform as a state legislator. He has also signed on to the Cruz effort. The candidate who seems less likely at this point to be tainted by his association with House Republicans, members of both parties agree, is Representative Tom Cotton, an Arkansas freshman who is challenging Senator Mark Pryor, a two-term Democrat. Mr. Cotton, 36, a former Army Ranger and Harvard Law School graduate, is a distinctive enough candidate that his association with House Republicans, strategists say, could be overshadowed by the more compelling aspects of his biography. For their part, the incumbent Democrats who will face off against the Republicans who have embraced the shutdown strategy seem to feel that they have caught a lucky break. When told the other day that Republicans were hopeful they could topple her by attacking her insistence that Democrats not give in on the health law or the debt ceiling, Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was incredulous. âOh, really?â she said. âOh, really?â What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the concerns of Republicans regarding their chances in upcoming Senate elections due to the fallout from fiscal battles and infighting within the party. The Tea Party's aggressive stance against Republicans they deem not conservative enough has generated internal conflict, potentially benefiting the Democrats.

It's a difficult sport, but that isn't stopping the world from picking it up. The court where sepaktakraw is played is the size of one used for badminton doubles. A net and a plastic ball a little larger than a baseball are used. Two teams of three players(left inside, right inside, and server) take their places on either side. A teammate passes the ball to the server who kicks it over the net. Points are scored when the ball touches the court surface on the other side. How sepaktakraw began has been a hot topic. Many Asian cultures once had their own names and rules for it. In Thailand the sport can be found on a famous mural . It was also played to celebrate the writing of the nations' first constitution in 1933. however, various nations discussed to decide the official name and rules in 1960, At last, sepak is a Malay word for \\"kick\\", and takraw is Thai for \\"woven ball\\". International tournaments have been held for many years, but sepaktakraw continues to improve. It was introduced as an exhibition event at the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung. And though no other countries can b equal to Thailand in sepaktakraw, they will show improvement. Twenty-five continents on five continents now claim active teams that play internationally.

First, we have this equation: -230*w - 899 + 1322 = -5787 Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We have -899 + 1322, which is like having 1322 stickers and then taking away 899 stickers. So, we get 423 stickers (1322 - 899 = 423). The equation now looks like this: -230*w + 423 = -5787 Next, we want to get -230*w by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll subtract 423 from both sides. Think of this like having 423 apples on both sides and taking them away. So, we have: -230*w + 423 - 423 = -5787 - 423 This simplifies to: -230*w = -6210 Now, we want to find the value of 'w'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -230. Think of this as sharing -6210 cookies among -230 friends equally. So, we get: w = -6210 / -230 When you divide -6210 by -230, you get 27. So, the answer is: w = 27 And that's it, buddy! The value of 'w' is 27."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Cobb was born in 1886 in Narrows, Georgia, a small rural community of farmers that was unincorporated. He was the first of three children born to William Herschel Cobb (1863-1905) and Amanda Chitwood Cobb (1871-1936). Cobb's father was a state senator. When he was still an infant, his parents moved to nearby Royston, where he was raised. At the age of 62, Cobb married a second time in 1949. His new wife was 40-year-old Frances Fairbairn Cass, a divorcee from Buffalo, New York. Their childless marriage also failed, ending with a divorce in 1956. At this time, Cobb became generous with his wealth, donating 100,000 in his parents' name for his hometown to build a modern 24-bed hospital, Cobb Memorial Hospital, which is now part of the Ty Cobb Healthcare System. He also established the Cobb Educational Fund, which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a 100,000 donation in 1953 (equivalent to approximately 914,677 in current year dollars ). He knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set the record straight on him and teach young players how to play. John McCallum spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography titled The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb that was published in 1956. In December 1959, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and Bright's disease. It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, My Life in Baseball: The True Record, with writer Al Stump. Later Stump would claim the collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb's death Stump published two more books and a short story giving what he claimed was the \\"true story\\". One of these later books was used as the basis for the 1994 film Cobb (a box office flop starring Tommy Lee Jones as Cobb and directed by Ron Shelton). In 2010, an article by William R. \\"Ron\\" Cobb (no relation to Ty) in the peer-reviewed The National Pastime (the official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research) accused Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb-related documents and diaries. The article further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb in his last years, most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light.

Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of the Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe, most notably King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Acceding to the throne in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. He also launched Germany on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. German foreign policy under Wilhelm II was faced with a number of significant problems. Perhaps the most apparent was that Wilhelm was an impatient man, subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse. He was personally ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course. It is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which Wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the German foreign policy elite. There were a number of notorious examples, such as the Kruger telegram of 1896 in which Wilhelm congratulated President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal Republic on the suppression of the British Jameson Raid, thus alienating British public opinion. British public opinion had been quite favourable toward the Kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne, but it turned sour in the late 1890s. During the First World War, he became the central target of British anti-German propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy. Wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other European rulers in the perils they faced by invading China; few other leaders paid attention. Wilhelm used the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War to try to incite fear in the west of the yellow peril that they faced by a resurgent Japan, which Wilhelm claimed would ally with China to overrun the west. Under Wilhelm, Germany invested in strengthening its colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but few became profitable and all were lost during the First World War. In South West Africa (now Namibia), a native revolt against German rule led to the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, although Wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped. One of the few times when Wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in 1900 he supported the marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria to Sophie Chotek, against the wishes of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. A domestic triumph for Wilhelm was when his daughter Victoria Louise married the Duke of Brunswick in 1913; this helped heal the rift between the House of Hanover and the House of Hohenzollern which followed the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866.

This is after all one of Africa's major economic powerhouses and a country with a rich history that is consistently held up as a successful example of democracy in the continent. Despite its relatively small size and population, Ghana boasts today one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, driven mainly by its substantial natural riches and strong agricultural production.

With these significant discoveries, the country has been able to further diversify and strengthen its economy. Moreover, the revenues generated from the oil and gas sector have been invested in infrastructure development and other essential sectors, such as education, healthcare, and technology, thus improving the overall quality of life for Ghanaians. Besides its natural resources, Ghana is also internationally renowned for its cultural heritage and vibrant traditions. Home to the Ashanti, Fante, Ewe, Ga, and other ethnic groups, the nation has a unique identity that is rooted in a rich tapestry of customs, music, dance, and clothing. The celebration of festivals, such as the Akwasidae, Homowo, and Hogbetsotso, serve as a testament to this diverse cultural heritage and also help to foster a sense of unity and pride. Tourism is yet another key contributor to Ghana's thriving economy, attracting visitors from all around the world. From the stunning coastline with sandy beaches to the lush green nature reserves, the country has numerous attractions that appeal to a wide variety of interests. Furthermore, the UNESCO World Heritage sites, such as the Asante Traditional Buildings, the Cape Coast Castle, and the Elmina Castle, provide an invaluable insight into the nation's turbulent past and its fight for independence. In the realm of sports, Ghana has consistently performed well on the international stage, particularly in football, boxing, and athletics. The Ghanaian national football team, the Black Stars, have qualified for three consecutive FIFA World Cups, while the nation's athletes have won multiple medals at the Olympic Games and other international competitions. These achievements have not only raised Ghana's profile globally but also inspired young athletes in the country to pursue their dreams. Ghana's commitment to democracy and good governance is another reason for it being held up as a successful example on the African continent. Since transitioning to multi-party democracy in 1992, the country has held several peaceful elections, and the peaceful transfer of power between opposing political parties is a significant achievement, especially considering the challenges faced by other nations in the region. In conclusion, Ghana, despite its relatively small size and population, has emerged as one of Africa's major economic powerhouses and a shining example of democracy in the continent. Its successes can be attributed to the abundant natural resources, rich cultural heritage, strong agricultural production, prominence in sports, and commitment to good governance. This progress serves as an inspiration to other countries, and it is evident that Ghanaians have many reasons to feel proud of their nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Why are multiple objects within the speaker 's vision glowing brightly ?","completion":"The multiple objects within the speaker's vision are glowing brightly due to the presence of black-lights in the basement, as well as the use of glow-in-the-dark swirls in pink and green painted all around. This setting suggests that they are at a celebration that centers around the use of glow-in-the-dark objects. The black-lights emit ultraviolet (UV) light, which causes certain objects and materials to fluoresce - that is, to emit visible light when exposed to UV radiation. In this case, the glow-in-the-dark swirls, the participants' teeth, and the whites of their clothing are likely made from or coated with phosphorescent materials that have the ability to absorb energy from the UV light emitted by the black-lights and then re-emit that energy as visible light, creating a glowing effect. Phosphorescent materials contain special pigments that can store the energy from UV light for some time and then gradually release it as visible light, resulting in the glowing appearance. The celebration seems to involve a foam party as well, as the participants are covered in bubbles and foam that reach up to their thighs. The vivid glowing effects created by the combination of black-lights, phosphorescent materials, and the foam create an immersive, entertaining, and visually striking environment for the people at the event. They can enjoy the unique atmosphere of this glow-in-the-dark party while interacting with one another and experiencing the fun sensation of being surrounded by foam and bubbles. In summary, the glowing objects within the speaker's vision are due to the presence of black-lights and glow-in-the-dark materials in the basement, as well as phosphorescent substances on their clothing and teeth, which all contribute to creating a lively and visually engaging environment for a celebration centered around the use of glow-in-the-dark objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin. Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks, who has a strong interest in Oliver.

All white blood cells have nuclei, which distinguishes them from the other blood cells, the anucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Types of white blood cells can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils (acidophiles), basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic. Further subtypes can be classified; for example, among lymphocytes, there are B cells, T cells, and NK cells.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers. Question: \\"Was there a normal amount of passengers on United 99-33 on 9/11?\\" Response: \\"There were many empty seats\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

Context: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intra-aortic filter on postoperative outcomes in high-risk cardiac surgical patients.', 'An intra-aortic filter was used in 316 (4.9%) of 6442 cardiac surgical cases from 2003 to 2013. A retrospective analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) registry data was performed for 204 patients with filter placement who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 89), valve replacement (n = 63) or combined CABG and valve replacement (n = 52), matched with 1224 patients without filter placement by STS mortality scores based on propensity scores. Generalized linear modelling was used to compare rates of complications as well as the length of stay and time in the intensive care unit (ICU). A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.', 'Overall, patients with filters before matching had a significantly higher risk of death than did the patients without filters: 12.0% of patients with filters had an STS mortality risk score ≥4 vs 7.7% of patients without filters (P = 0.027). After analysis of the composite end-point of all STS major morbidities, the matched filter group had fewer overall complications (6.8 vs 13.2%, P = 0.02). The rate of postoperative respiratory failure was lower in the filter group (2.5 vs 7.0%, P = 0.01). Rates of stroke and new-onset haemodialysis, while not statistically different, were almost 50% lower in the filter group. Length of stay in the hospital and in the ICU was not significantly different; however, in patients with postoperative complications, time in the ICU (163 vs 189 h, P = 0.02) was shorter for the filter patients.Question: Does selective use of the intra-aortic filter in high-risk cardiac surgical patients lead to better postoperative outcomes? A:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to determine if the selective use of an intra-aortic filter in high-risk cardiac surgical patients leads to better postoperative outcomes based on the given context. 1.

I like the fact that I can use the Wii board and monitor the weight; however, I don't like the new set up with the instructors and I don't use the nutrition part. Total waste of my money! The answer is:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the product, stating several negative aspects such as the lack of customization for equipment, workout duration, and challenge level.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who was Harriet Hobson returning the watch for? from the following article ? Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

Write an article with the title: \\"The invisible threat\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Invisible Threat Introduction The modern era is characterized by an endless array of technological advancements and scientific discoveries. Our world has come a long way from the early days of mankind and has fundamentally transformed the ways in which we live, work, and interact. Unfortunately, like everything else, there is a dark side to these rapid advances. Beyond the visible progress lies an invisible threat, one that permeates every aspect of our lives: cyber threats. This article will delve deep into the world of cyber threats, their origins, current state, and consequences, while also discussing methods of safeguarding against these invisible dangers. We must confront these threats head-on if we want to protect the foundations upon which our increasingly digital world is built. A Brief History of Cyber Threats The concept of a cyber threat can be traced back to the early days of the internet when hackers and cybercriminals first began to explore the potential of an interconnected digital space. They found that access to sensitive information was often poorly protected, affording opportunities to carry out various malicious activities. One of the earliest examples dates back to 1988 when the Morris Worm, one of the first worms created to specifically target vulnerabilities in computer networks, spread across the early internet and infected thousands of computers worldwide. As the internet continued to grow and efficiencies improved, so too did the complexity and breadth of the threats. Stakeholders and targets for cyber attacks expanded to include individuals, enterprises, and even entire governments. The risks posed by cyber threats evolved from mere data breaches and minor disruptions to massive global impacts with far-reaching consequences. The Current State of Cyber Threats Today, the invisible threat we face spans across nearly every digital device and platform, manifesting itself in diverse and sophisticated ways. Some of the most prevalent threats include: 1. Phishing attacks - The act of deceiving individuals with targeted emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, convincing the recipients to provide sensitive information, or download malicious software. 2. Ransomware - A type of malware that encrypts data, rendering it inaccessible, and demands a ransom for the decryption keys. 3. DDoS attacks - Distributed Denial of Service attacks overload servers or networks with excessive traffic, causing them to crash and become inaccessible to legitimate users. 4. Insider threats - Arising from individuals within organizations who deliberately misuse their access to compromise systems, steal information, or otherwise harm the organization. 5. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) - Highly sophisticated, long-lasting cyberattacks on high-value targets, frequently carried out by state-sponsored hackers. The Consequences of Ignoring The Invisible Threat The consequences of underestimating or ignoring the invisible threat are far-reaching. In the past decade alone, large-scale cyber attacks have caused billions of dollars in damages, notably impacting corporations, governmental organizations, and critical infrastructure. In 2013, the massive Target data breach saw millions of customers' personal data stolen, leading to significant financial and reputational losses. Additionally, cyber threats can jeopardize global security as certain state-sponsored actors harness these tools to influence foreign governments, disrupt elections, and destabilize nations. Combating the Invisible Threat To protect ourselves against the invisible threat, a combination of awareness, technology, and collaboration must be employed. 1. Implement strong cybersecurity frameworks - Organizations should have clearly defined cybersecurity policies, coupled with frequent security updates, vulnerability scans, and risk assessments. 2. Cybersecurity education - Regular training for employees and individuals to recognize and resist cyber threats. 3. Collaboration between governments and private entities - Formulating global cybersecurity standards and sharing essential information on potential and active threats to improve the overall security posture. 4. Continuous innovation - The development of advanced security technologies that can detect, prevent, or mitigate cyber threats. Conclusion The invisible threat, though daunting, is not insurmountable. As technology advances and our reliance on digital systems grow, so too must our commitment to defending against these threats. With a collective mindset, continued vigilance, and an adaptive approach, we can ensure the security of our digital world for generations to come."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Pennsylvania House of Representatives is the lower house of the bicameral Pennsylvania General Assembly, the legislature of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

News article: Using ultraviolet light, British Library scientists were able to photograph the text of the 1215 Burnt Magna Carta that is invisible to the human eye. More than 280 years after it was damaged in a fire, one of the original copies of the Magna Carta is legible again. Written in 1215, the Magna Carta required the king of England — King John — to cede absolute power. Today, the Magna Carta is seen as a first step toward constitutional law rather than the hereditary power of royalty. There were four copies of the document created at the time. One, held by the British Library, was badly damaged in a fire in 1731. Now, researchers have used a technique called multispectral imaging to decipher the text of the \\"Burnt Magna Carta\\" without touching or further damaging the delicate parchment. This imaging allowed conservation scientists to take pictures of the document that virtually erase the damage and show details of the parchment and text. \\"It was in such a terrible state, we couldn't read any of it, really,\\" said Christina Duffy, a British Library imaging scientist. \\"It was actually quite a surprise that so much text was recovered.\\" [See Images of the Recovered Magna Carta Text] Damaged document The imaging is part of the preparations for the 800th anniversary of the sealing of the Magna Carta, when King John imprinted his royal seal on the document and was bound by oath to abide by its demands. The British Library holds two of the original copies of the Magna Carta from 1215, including the burnt version. The other two copies are held at Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral. On Feb. 3, 2015, the four copies will be displayed side-by-side at the British Library in London for the first time ever. The public can enter a lottery for free tickets to the viewing, which will be available to 1,215 winners. Registration is available on the British Library website. The Burnt Magna Carta has not been examined for decades, Duffy told Live Science. In the 1970s, it was set in a very secure frame, she said. That out-of-date frame has been removed in anticipation of the February 2015 anniversary, giving scientists the chance to get a closer look at the document. Revisiting the text The British Library team had no interest in trying to restore the smoke-damaged document, Duffy said, but wanted to preserve it as-is. \\"There are different ways you can treat it,\\" she said. \\"But a lot of them would be wet processes, so you might have to dampen certain areas, and we don't want to introduce any moisture at all to the charter.\\" Instead, the scientists used multispectral imaging, essentially photographing the burnt parchment in a variety of LED lights, spanning the spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared — outside the range of human vision. \\"If you're interested in the ink, the ultraviolet light gives you the best information. If you are interested in the actual texture of the parchment itself, the infrared would be better,\\" Duffy said. \\"You end up with multiple images of essentially the same thing, but giving you different information.\\" In these images, text that is invisible to the naked eye is suddenly visible. The Burnt Magna Carta is basically identical in text to the other three copies from 1215, Duffy said. The team is still processing the multispectral imagery and will conduct the same process on other old documents related to the Magna Carta, she said. Both the British Library's original Magna Carta manuscripts will be displayed between March 13, 2015 and Sept. 1, 2015, in an exhibit called \\"Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy.\\" Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+.

Photograph: British Library The four surviving copies of the original Magna Carta from 1215 will come together for the first time in history next February as part of a one-off event to mark the 800th anniversary of the signing of the historic document. The Magna Carta – literally, Great Charter – was issued by King John in 1215, as his barons revolted and civil war loomed. It saw the monarch avert crisis by acknowledging that the king was not above the law, and with the granting of a range of rights to English citizens. “To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice,” runs one of its most famous clauses. Written on single sheets of parchment, running to around 4,000 words of medieval Latin, two of the surviving 1215 Magna Carta documents are kept at the British Library – one of which was severely damaged in an 18th-century fire, and which has been painstakingly restored using multispectral imaging. One is currently at Lincoln Cathedral, and one at Salisbury Cathedral. On 3 February 2015, they will be brought together at the British Library. “It’s not just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity – this is the first time in history this will happen,” said Julian Harrison, curator of medieval manuscripts at the British Library. “The documents which survive were all written by different scribes – we know this because of the different handwriting. And as each was finished, it would have been sent out to various recipients ... We don’t know how many would have been originally drawn up and sent out – I’d imagine relatively small numbers. Only four survive.” Known as the “Burnt Magna Carta”, one of the four copies of the charter was burned in the Cotton library fire of 1731. Attempts to restore it subsequently made it even more difficult to read, but now conservators and scientists at the British Library have used new techniques to virtually peel away the layers of damage affecting the manuscript, and make its text readable for the first time in centuries. “It’s absolutely astonishing. It’s been unable to be read with the naked eye for 200-plus years,” said Harrison. “We couldn’t have done this even three or four years ago – it’s very exciting ... We knew what the text was going to say, but it is just being able to see the original medieval handwriting. It was clearly a beautiful manuscript in its heyday.” Each of the documents is “slightly different”, added Harrison. “It’s what you would expect if something was copied out by hand.” The British Library described the Magna Carta as “one of the world’s most influential documents”, saying that in the centuries since it was signed, it has “become a potent symbol of liberty and the rule of law”. It is offering just 1,215 people from around the world the chance to view the four documents side by side on 3 February 2015, via a ballot. Winners of the free ballot will be greeted by the historian Dan Jones, and subsequently, “to the sound of live medieval music ... will be taken by costumed characters from the 13th century to view the four original Magna Carta manuscripts on display together for the first time”, said the institution. The Lincoln and Salisbury copies will then return to their home institutions for further, separate exhibitions. “It’s fair to say it is one of the most famous documents in the world,” said Harrison. “It has this global significance. Nelson Mandela cites it, as does Thomas More; it influenced Thomas Jefferson as he drew up the Declaration of Independence; it influenced the universal declaration of human rights. And what’s most remarkable about it is that some of its clauses are still valid in English law. Those who drew it up in 1215 would have had no expectations that it would last beyond a few months, but it still resonates today.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"British Library scientists have used ultraviolet light to photograph the text of the 1215 Burnt Magna Carta, which was invisible to the human eye.

Question: Why does Jessica take off her cross? Movie title: The Thing That Couldn't Die Movie plot: A young woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney), who claims to have psychic powers, lives on a remote ranch with her Aunt Flavia (Peggy Converse). She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets. Once his head and body are joined, Gideon will be fully able to exercise his powers over all comers. The young woman is aware of the evil and is protected from the head's influence by an ancient cross she wears around her neck, but when her boyfriend removes it, to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised, the head takes control of her mind. So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business. The young woman joins head to body and Gideon arises from his coffin, but the boyfriend, aware of the error of his ways, catches the monster... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jessica takes off her cross because her boyfriend, Gordon, wants to make a cast of it in order to appraise its historical value. Unknowingly, this action puts Jessica in a vulnerable position, as the ancient cross she wears around her neck serves as a protective barrier against the evil influence of Gideon Drew's head. When the cross is removed, Gideon is able to take control of her mind. The irony in this situation lies in the fact that the person who was trying to protect Jessica, her boyfriend Gordon, ultimately places her in harm's way. This incident serves as a turning point in the movie, putting Jessica in direct contact with the evil forces she had been trying to avoid. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of the cross as a powerful symbol and protective charm against dark powers. In conclusion, the removal of Jessica's cross is a pivotal moment in the movie \\"The Thing That Couldn't Die,\\" as it not only exposes her to Gideon Drew's evil influence but also reveals the importance of ancient artifacts and their connection to historical events and beliefs. It shows that even with good intentions, actions can sometimes have unintended consequences and that knowledge about ancient artifacts' potential effects can be crucial for protecting against unforeseen dangers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choices: - muscle tissues - blood tissue - dependent tissue - nervous tissue A: A:","completion":"The correct answer is nervous tissue. Nervous tissue is a specialized and crucial component of the human body and plays a significant role in the overall functioning of the body's systems. It primarily consists of nerve cells, also known as neurons, which are responsible for sensing external and internal stimuli, transmitting the signals via electrical impulses, and enabling communication between various body parts. Nervous tissue can be categorized into two main types, based on their location and function: 1. Central nervous system (CNS) tissue: This type of nervous tissue is found in the brain and spinal cord, which make up the central nervous system. The primary roles of the CNS are processing and integrating the information it receives from peripheral nerves, coordinating and controlling the functions of the entire body, and generating thought processes and behavior. 2. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissue: Peripheral nervous system tissue extends from the central nervous system to different parts of the body, including the organs, limbs, and other structures. The main function of the PNS is to relay the sensory information from the body to the CNS and broadcast signals from the CNS to various muscles, glands, and other tissues. Now, let's compare nervous tissue to the other choices mentioned: - Muscle tissues: These tissues are composed of specialized cells that contract and generate movement. There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Skeletal muscles are associated with voluntary movements, cardiac muscles make up the heart, and smooth muscles are found in various organs and control involuntary processes like the movements of food in the digestive system. Muscle tissue is not involved in sensing stimuli and transmitting signals. - Blood tissue: Technically, blood is classified as a connective tissue and is composed of four primary components: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood is responsible for the transportation of oxygen, nutrients, hormones, waste products, and immune cells throughout the body. While blood does play a role in transporting signal molecules like hormones, it does not contain nerve cells or transmits signals via electrical impulses, the same way nervous tissue does. - Dependent tissue: There is no such thing as \\"dependent tissue\\" in the context of human anatomy and physiology. The term may have been mistakenly mentioned or is irrelevant to the question at hand. In conclusion, nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells, or neurons, that sense stimuli and transmit signals in the form of electrical impulses throughout the body. This unique function sets them apart from other types of tissues, such as muscle and blood tissue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Yes, it logically follows that \\"A child rides a motorcycle\\" when given the statement \\"A young kid rides a dirt bike in a race.\\" Let's break down the reasoning behind this answer: 1. The subject in both statements is a young person, described as a \\"young kid\\" and a \\"child.\\" These terms can be considered interchangeable in this context, as both words are used to describe someone of a young age. 2. The action in both statements is the act of riding, which applies similarly to both cases. 3. The object being ridden is described as a \\"dirt bike\\" in the first statement and a \\"motorcycle\\" in the second. A dirt bike is a type of off-road motorcycle designed specifically for rough terrain and racing on unpaved surfaces. Thus, a dirt bike can be considered a specialized type of motorcycle.

The doctor recommended cigars more than he did the cigarettes because the Choose your answer from: I. cigarettes were more deadly. II. cigars were more deadly.","completion":"The doctor recommended cigars more than he did the cigarettes because the cigarettes were more deadly. It is important to note that both cigarettes and cigars pose significant health risks and should ideally not be used at all; however, there are some differences between the two that could lead the doctor to choose one over the other. I. Cigarettes were more deadly: 1. Higher levels of toxic chemicals: Cigarettes generally contain higher levels of toxic chemicals, such as tar and nicotine, as compared to cigars. The chemicals in cigarettes are also more easily absorbed into the body since they have a finer cut. This could result in a greater amount of harmful substances being absorbed through the lungs and ultimately causing more damage. 2. The way they are smoked: Cigarette smoking typically involves inhaling the smoke, which means harmful chemicals, such as carbon monoxide and acetaldehyde, directly enter the lungs. On the other hand, cigar smokers tend to \\"puff\\" rather than inhale the smoke. While this practice still exposes smokers to harmful chemicals and carcinogens, they are less likely to experience the same degree of lung damage as cigarette smokers. 3. Frequency of use: Cigarette smokers tend to smoke more frequently and consume more cigarettes daily than those who smoke cigars. This higher frequency of use contributes to a greater overall exposure to harmful substances, potentially increasing the risk of various health issues. 4. Addiction potential: Cigarettes contain high levels of nicotine, making them more addictive than cigars. This heightened addiction potential may lead to more prolonged use, increasing the likelihood of developing smoking-related health issues. Despite the doctor's recommendation of cigars over cigarettes, it is essential to emphasize that smoking, in general, is extremely harmful to one's health. Both cigarettes and cigars have been linked to various health conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease, and numerous respiratory issues. The healthiest option is to avoid smoking altogether."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is asking about the ability to sell branded items on a self-created website. To answer that: Yes, you can sell branded items on your own website, but there are certain factors to consider when doing this. 1. Legality: Ensure that the branded items you want to sell are obtained legally, and you have the necessary permissions to distribute them. In some cases, you may need to partner with the brand owner or manufacturer to get the authorization to sell their products. 2. Licenses and Permits: Depending on your local laws, you may be required to obtain the appropriate licenses and permits to sell branded items online. 3. Authenticity: You must ensure that the products you are selling are authentic and not counterfeit, as selling fake products can lead to legal repercussions. 4. Pricing: Make sure to set competitive prices to attract consumers while maintaining a balance between profit and sustainability. 5. Website Design and Functionality: Create a user-friendly and visually appealing website with easy-to-use navigation and a secure payment gateway. 6. Marketing and Promotion: Utilize various digital marketing techniques, such as social media, search engine optimization, and email marketing, to promote your website and products. 7. Customer Service: Ensure you offer quality customer service by addressing queries and concerns, processing returns, and handling complaints effectively. The second question is asking about lesser-known sights to visit in Salavat, Russia. To answer that: Salavat, located in the Republic of Bashkortostan in Russia, may not be a popular tourist destination, but it does offer some interesting sights for visitors. Some lesser-known attractions to visit in Salavat are: 1. Yulay Park - A picturesque green space with beautiful landscapes, walking paths, and recreational facilities making it the perfect destination for a leisurely stroll or family picnic. 2. Monument to Salawat Yulayev - A significant local landmark that represents the history and culture of the region. Salawat Yulayev was a national hero and a freedom fighter and this monument serves as a tribute to his contributions. 3. Museum of Local Lore - This museum highlights the history, traditions, and cultural aspects of the Salavat region and the Republic of Bashkortostan, offering a deeper understanding of the area. 4. Holy Trinity Church - This orthodox church showcases beautiful architecture and offers a serene atmosphere for spiritual reflection. 5. Victory Park - This park is a tribute to the local heroes who fought for their homeland. The park features monuments, sculptures, and well-maintained pedestrian zones suitable for strolling and relaxation. 6. Stela City of Military Glory - A monument dedicated to Salavat's recognition as a city of military glory. The stela is located in a park and consists of a 28-meter-high stele symbolizing the eternal memory of the sacrifices made by locals during wartime. In conclusion, these two questions inquire about different topics: one focuses on selling branded items on a self-created website, while the other seeks lesser-known attractions in Salavat, Russia.

The project involves the installation of a new electricity distribution connection, approximately 19 miles (30km) in length, linking areas from Llandyfaelog, positioned to the east of Idole, under the River Towy, and then to the west of Peniel. The company plans to install about 4.3 miles (7km) of this connection underground, however, critics of the project are opposing the use of overhead lines on wooden double-poles for the rest of the connection. These overhead power line wooden poles are said to be up to 18m (59ft) high. Opponents argue that the installation of these overhead power lines would negatively impact the local community, the environment, as well as the tourism sector in the area. They believe the development would damage people's lives within the vicinity, disrupt the local ecology, and possibly deter tourists, therefore having potential adverse impacts to the local economy. To address the voiced concerns, Andrew Hubbold, a representative from Western Power Distribution, made known that the company plans to publish a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) in the coming autumn. This SoCC will outline how the third and final stage of the consultation process for the proposed connection will be conducted. This final stage seems designed to allow community members to voice their opinions and have a say in the project.

Context: Michael Morzeny put his hands into the pockets of his overcoat and hugged the fabric tighter around his body. The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Options: - laugh - sit - being entertained - math - meet The answer is \\"meet\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is \\"meet\\" because before going to play, a kid would likely meet up with their friend as the first step in their activity. This ensures that they are both ready and on the same page before starting any game or activity together. Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are not as suitable: - Laugh: While laughter can be a part of playing and spending time with a friend, it is not typically the first thing that must happen before starting to play. Laughing might occur during or after playing when they share fun moments together. - Sit: Sitting does not necessarily mean they are preparing to play, nor is it an essential step to take before playing. They may sit together while discussing what they want to do, but it's not a direct requirement for starting a game or activity. - Being entertained: While playing can be entertaining, \\"being entertained\\" is a somewhat passive term that doesn't imply they are preparing to play themselves. They might be entertained by watching a show or by someone else's performance, but it does not suggest active participation. - Math: Math is a subject and an activity on its own, not related to the general context of kids going to play. While they might do math together as part of their play, it is not a prerequisite to their playing activities. To summarize, \\"meet\\" is the most appropriate answer because it is the most logical and necessary step to be taken before kids can begin engaging in play together.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The questions you've asked are not paraphrases of each other and address separate topics. For the first question, the promotion of your sweet shop on the screens of Gossip Cinemas will depend on several factors. Here is a detailed breakdown of the process: 1. Research: Begin by contacting Gossip Cinemas to obtain their advertising rates and packages. This information may be available on their website or by reaching out to their advertising department. Consider the following aspects: a. Screen ad duration: Assess the costs associated with varying ad lengths, such as 15, 30 or 60 seconds. b. Frequency: Determine the frequency with which your advertisement will be displayed throughout the day, weekend, or month. c. Location: Where your sweet shop is located will impact the cost of your advertisement. Local or regional ads may be more cost-effective versus national ads. 2. Budget: Establish a budget for your ad campaign factoring in the points mentioned above. 3. Production: Consider the cost of producing your advertisement, including hiring a videographer, storyboard, scriptwriting, and editing. 4. Design: Incorporate high-quality visuals, convey a clear message, and make your brand memorable with an engaging advertisement. 5. Time of year: Advertising rates might vary depending on the time of year. For example, ad space during the holiday season may be more expensive due to increased demand. After considering these factors, you will have a better understanding of the overall cost involved in promoting your sweet shop on the screens of Gossip Cinemas. As for the second question, politely avoiding a friend who gossips can be approached in several ways: 1. Be honest: Share your feelings about gossiping and how it negatively impacts your time together. It's possible they are unaware of your concerns and may modify their behavior. 2. Set boundaries: Let your friend know that you prefer meaningful conversations and would rather not engage in gossip. 3. Redirect the conversation: When gossip arises, steer the conversation in a more positive direction by discussing other topics or sharing good news. 4. Minimize contact: Limit the time spent together to deter gossiping. Engage in group settings so that the focus is not solely on one-on-one interaction. 5. Decline invitations tactfully: Politely decline offers to get together by explaining that your schedule is busy, but you appreciate the invitation. Remember, it is important to be respectful and polite so as not to damage your friendship. In conclusion, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first one relates to advertising a sweet shop in a cinema, while the second pertains to managing a relationship with a gossiping friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Katrina tried to mold Natalie in the type of person they wanted them to be, because Katrina was too controlling. Possessing an insatiable need for power and dominance over others in her life, Katrina's overbearing nature compelled her to suppress the unique qualities of those around her, preferring instead to create a world with people who fit her ideal image. This toxic behavior stifled the individuality and personal growth of everyone in her social circle, gravely affecting Natalie the most. As the two became friends, Katrina recognized Natalie's open and friendly nature, which she saw as an opportunity to project her own beliefs and desires onto her. Consciously or unconsciously, Katrina began to manipulate and dominate every aspect of Natalie's life. From dressing to social interactions, she placed her intense focus on modifying Natalie's behavior and choices, priding herself in the role of the puppet master. However, this excessive control came with consequences. Silent resentment festered within Natalie as she lost control not only of her external affairs, but also of her sense of self and personal identity. Desperate to break free from Katrina's grasp, she began planning her escape from this toxic friendship. Ironically, Katrina's desperate attempts at exerting control only served to distance her from the friends and relationships she valued. As her world slowly crumbled around her, she found herself increasingly isolated and powerless - a bitter pill to swallow for someone who thought she held dominion over others. In the end, the lesson Katrina would take away from this experience was that true friendship isn't born from a desire to control or change another person, but rather from the appreciation of their unique qualities and the mutual support and encouragement offered in times of both triumph and struggle. Unfortunately for Katrina, this realization came too late, and the damage to her relationship with Natalie was already done. To recover and grow from this, Katrina would need to recognize not only her toxic behaviors but also her underlying emotions that drove this desire for control. Therapy, self-reflection, and a genuine effort to show empathy and understanding towards others might be the first steps in that direction.

The sleek design of the gadget appealed to his visual taste, but it was the intricacies of its operating system and plethora of features that truly captivated him. Having always been an ardent fan of innovative technology, Greg was intrigued by the amount of sophisticated technology compactly fitted into that lightweight, wrist-worn device. The fitness tracker brilliantly combined practicality with tech-appeal and was more than just a stylish accessory or a fad. Equipped with a high-tech sensor suite, it was designed to monitor various physical metrics like step count, heart rate, and even sleep patterns – all things Greg had been neglecting due to his relaxed nature. The allure of instant digital data transformed his mundane daily routines into something of a science experiment. With every step taken, heartbeat recorded, and hour of sleep tracked, the fitness tracker was contributing to a database that Greg could analyze for improvements. The fact that this tiny device could pick up on details that even he failed to register wasn't just impressive; it was also a much-required wake-up call. The fitness tracker also came with an accompanying smartphone app, which allowed Greg to visualize and track his progress over time. This aspect of gamification seamlessly integrated into the device was a luring factor, calling to his love of digital interfaces and graphics. Furthermore, the fitness tracker encompassed a sense of modernity and progress. Greg admired the seamless integration of the fitness tracker with his daily life and other smart devices. Notifications about meeting his daily step targets or needing to get more sleep were just as regular as his email or social media notifications, albeit much healthier. Finally, the fitness tracker presented him an opportunity to quench his thirst for understanding newer technology. By chasing a healthier lifestyle using his love for technology, Greg saw the chance to turn a weakness into a strength. Although he bought a journal as well, it couldn't compete with the allure of the fitness tracker. Not that he didn't appreciate jotting notes or charting out manually, but the journal simply represented an analog activity in his digital world. In conclusion, Greg preferred the fitness tracker over the journal because of his affinity for technology. It was not just a step towards a healthier life but also a journey into understanding modern gadgetry. The fitness tracker effectively combined Greg's preference for contemporary technology with an initiative to overcome his lethargy, making it an obvious choice over the traditional journal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It took him five months and 13 pairs of shoes. He had great physical pain and he got really sore feet. If Dave hadn't believed in making his dreams come true, none of this would have happened. Dave left his job two weeks after he had bought a skateboard and decided to go on a journey.

Tatsache ist, dass das übrige Leben auf der Erde, das gemeinhin unter dem Begriff Biosphäre zusammengefasst wird, im Rhythmus der natürlichen Zeit lebt.

Translate to English English:","completion":"The fact is that the rest of life on Earth, commonly referred to as the biosphere, lives in the rhythm of natural time. Only humans alone live according to their self-created time standards. This statement highlights the difference between how human society has adapted to measure and segment time as compared to the rest of the living organisms on Earth. The biosphere, which consists of all the ecosystems on our planet, functions based on natural cycles and processes. These include the day-night cycle, the changing of seasons, and the various stages of life for plants and animals. Humans, on the other hand, have established a more complex system of measuring and organizing time in order to facilitate social, economic, and personal functioning. This system comprises units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. The use of calendars and clocks allows us to keep track of time in a standardized and organized manner, enabling the smooth functioning of our societies. Historically, early human societies lived according to the natural rhythms of the sun and moon, much like the other species on Earth. However, as we developed more advanced methods of agriculture, communication, and transportation, it became necessary to create a standardized system of timekeeping that would be globally recognized and accepted. One major development in timekeeping was the advent of mechanical clocks, which allowed for greater accuracy and uniformity in the measurement of time. Later, advancements such as electronic clocks, quartz crystals, and atomic clocks further improved the precision of timekeeping. Today, we rely on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as the basis for our time zones and standards. Despite the benefits of our standardized time system, there are also potential drawbacks to this approach. Living according to artificial time parameters can lead to a disconnection from the natural world and its rhythms, which may have negative implications for our well-being. As we spend our lives adhering to strict schedules and deadlines, we may lose touch with the cycles and patterns that govern the rest of the living organisms on Earth. A possible solution to balance the benefits of organized timekeeping and awareness of natural rhythms is to ensure that we intentionally engage with the natural world and appreciate its patterns. This can be achieved through activities such as gardening, hiking, birdwatching, or simply spending time in nature, as these pursuits help us to reconnect with the Earth's natural rhythms. In conclusion, while it is true that humans have established their own unique time standards, it is essential to recognize the importance of staying in tune with the natural rhythms of the biosphere. This balance between artificial time and natural time can potentially enhance our overall well-being and enable us to maintain a healthy relationship with the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Riding high from their Monday Night win over the Vikings, the Patriots returned home for a highly anticipated Sunday Night matchup with the Indianapolis Colts. In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions.

By Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia A teenager whose passport has been cancelled on security grounds turned up to a TV discussion about Australians fighting in Syria wearing an Islamic State flag symbol and then dramatically stormed out. Abu Bakr, 19, who is on the radar of security services, walked off set during an SBS Insight episode due to be shown on Tuesday night. The teenager, who was born in Australia but has an Italian and Iraqi background, turned up to the discussion wearing an Islamic State flag logo on his black jacket. Bakr thinks Muslims are obligated help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia. He said 'in order for me to be connected to the values here of Australia, the","completion":"values would have to change'. Furthermore, he claimed that there were certain aspects of Australian culture that he could not reconcile with his own beliefs, particularly the liberal attitudes towards alcohol, sexuality, and what he perceives as a lack of adherence to traditional and religious values. Bakr's strong connection to his Islamic faith drives him to prioritize the perceived needs of the global Muslim community over his loyalty to Australia. Bakr's viewpoint has been heavily influenced by the concept of Ummah, which is the belief in a united, global Muslim community that transcends borders and nationalities. This idea has led him to view the suffering of Muslims in war-torn countries like Syria as a collective responsibility, prompting him to support the actions of extremist groups like the Islamic State. Bakr claims that many Muslims in Australia have been radicalized due to feelings of alienation and discrimination, and that this justifies their desire to join foreign conflicts in their quest to establish more authentic and morally pure societies. This controversial perspective has garnered widespread attention and criticism. Some argue that Bakr's embracing of extremist views is a direct result of a growing disconnect between Australia's Muslim community and the nation's mainstream society, exacerbated by inadequate integration policies and rising tensions fueled by ignorance and fear. Others believe that it’s the consequence of religious indoctrination and exposure to extremist ideologies propagated through online platforms and social networks. In the wake of events like these, there are calls for stricter government measures to monitor and safeguard against radicalization. Suggestions range from increasing surveillance of suspected terrorists to creating de-radicalization programs aimed at educating, reforming, and reintegrating individuals who have been influenced by extremist ideologies. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for policies that promote social cohesion and inclusivity, to eliminate feelings of marginalization and reduce the appeal of extremist groups. While it’s clear that Bakr's actions and beliefs are symptomatic of larger, complex issues faced by Muslims living in Western societies, the majority of Muslims in Australia and other countries continue to denounce extremist groups like the Islamic State, maintain peace and advocate for unity. It’s important for governments and communities to work together to address the underlying issues contributing to radicalization, in order to build strong, inclusive societies that respect cultural and religious differences, and reduce the risk of future extremism. In conclusion, Abu Bakr's display during the SBS Insight episode speaks to a broader concern regarding the potential radicalization of Western Muslims and the challenges faced in building inclusive societies that respect everyone's diverse backgrounds. While it’s crucial that authorities implement stringent measures to protect citizens from extremist threats, nurturing open dialogue and understanding among communities of various faiths is equally important to foster social cohesion and prevent the spread of extremist ideologies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Where are you likely to find a bald eagle on a floating bridge? - pacific northwest - river - canada - northern california - washington state The best answer is A:","completion":"In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, you are most likely to find a bald eagle on a floating bridge. Spanning across rivers, these floating bridges are commonly found in areas with a high concentration of water bodies, such as the Pacific Northwest, which covers parts of Canada, Northern California, and Washington State. The bald eagle is a large bird of prey commonly found in North America, especially in areas with significant amounts of forest, water, and open spaces. These habitats are abundant in the Pacific Northwest, making it a haven for bald eagles to thrive. The birds prefer to live near water sources, as they primarily hunt for fish, which makes the rivers in the area an ideal spot for observing these magnificent creatures. One place where you might find a floating bridge that could potentially attract bald eagles is Washington State. Washington is home to several floating bridges, including the SR 520 Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (the world's longest floating bridge) and the I-90 Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. These floating bridges span vast bodies of water, such as Lake Washington and Lake Union, offering ample opportunities for bald eagles to hunt and rest. Another location where you may find a bald eagle on a floating bridge is along the rivers of British Columbia, Canada. Due to the abundance of rivers and lush forests present in this province, it provides the perfect ecosystem for bald eagles to live and breed. While floating bridges are not as common in British Columbia compared to Washington State, they can still be found occasionally, primarily serving as temporary structures during construction or as means to cross bodies of water. Similarly, Northern California is another region where the habitat is conducive for bald eagles. The area boasts dense forests, rivers, and lakes, allowing bald eagles to find suitable nesting sites and ample food sources. Although floating bridges are less common in this region compared to Washington State, it is still possible to come across them near waterways. In conclusion, the Pacific Northwest is indeed the best area to find a bald eagle on a floating bridge. Washington State has the highest concentration of floating bridges, making it the most likely destination to spot one. However, other areas within the Pacific Northwest, such as British Columbia and Northern California, also provide suitable habitats for bald eagles, increasing the chances of encountering one on a floating bridge across a river or lake. To increase your chances of spotting a bald eagle on a floating bridge, it is recommended to visit areas near rivers or large water bodies during the prime nesting and feeding seasons, typically during the spring and summer months."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a comprehensive list of advice that may help someone with social anxiety disorder: 1. Acknowledge and accept the anxiety: Understanding that social anxiety is a part of your life and accepting it as a challenge can make a significant difference. Educate yourself about social anxiety disorder and make an effort to self-reflect about your feelings and triggers. 2. Seek professional help: A therapist or psychologist can provide essential guidance and support in managing and overcoming social anxiety.

Develop coping strategies: Learn various coping techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises, visualization, and progressive muscle relaxation. Create an anxiety toolbox with skills that help you manage your anxiety when it arises. 4. Take baby steps: Facing your fear head-on can be counterproductive. Instead, take small, manageable steps towards overcoming your anxiety, such as gradually increasing social interactions or participating in group activities that fit your comfort level. 5. Set realistic goals: Establish achievable short-term and long-term goals. Avoid putting pressure on yourself to suddenly change from being anxious in social situations to being confident overnight. Accept that progress will take time and effort. 6. Be kind to yourself: Recognize that nobody is perfect, and everyone gets anxious from time to time. Treat yourself with kindness and compassion when facing setbacks or making mistakes. 7. Build a support network: Talk to friends and family who you trust about your struggles. Connecting with others who have social anxiety or joining a support group can also be highly beneficial. 8. Practice mindfulness and meditation: Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation, yoga, or journaling, can help you become more in tune with your thoughts, feelings, and emotions, making it easier to manage your anxiety. 9. Develop healthy habits: Adopting a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep can improve your overall mental and physical wellbeing, making it easier to cope with anxiety. 10. Challenge negative thoughts: Identifying and replacing negative thoughts with more realistic and positive ones can help you navigate social situations more confidently. 11. Improve social skills: Social anxiety can make it hard to communicate effectively with others. Practice improving your social skills, such as maintaining eye contact, active listening, and asking open-ended questions, to make social interactions more enjoyable and less anxiety-provoking. 12. Gradual exposure: By exposing yourself to anxiety-provoking situations gradually and consistently, you can become more comfortable and confident in various social scenarios over time. Remember that overcoming social anxiety is a continuous process. While some days will be more challenging than others, implementing the listed advice can make a significant impact on your journey towards managing and ultimately overcoming social anxiety disorder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We had heard nothing but wonderful things about the place, so we were eager to experience it for ourselves. What we encountered exceeded our expectations on every level – the food, the service, and the ambiance. From the moment we stepped into The Gourmet Bistro, we were greeted with warmth and sincerity. The hostess welcomed us with a smile and quickly led us to our table. Candlelight and soft background music created a cozy and intimate atmosphere, making us feel relaxed and comfortable right away. It didn't take long for us to realize that the menu was indeed as impressive as we'd heard. With an extensive variety of dishes, from succulent seafood options to mouth-watering meats and a delightful vegetarian selection, there was something for everyone in our group. The chef's attention to incorporating fresh, local ingredients contributed to the allure of each dish. We decided to start off with a shared appetizer, the caramelized onion and goat cheese flatbread, which was the perfect balance of rich flavors and textures. For our main courses, I ordered the Grilled Sea Bass with lemon caper sauce, while my friends opted for the Rack of Lamb and the Wild Mushroom Risotto. The presentation of each dish was elegant, and every bite was bursting with deliciousness. All of us agreed that these were among the best dishes we had ever tasted, and we could not stop praising the talent of the chef. Throughout the evening, our waiter demonstrated exceptional professionalism and attentiveness. He was well-acquainted with the menu and offered valuable recommendations. He checked in with us regularly, ensuring that our wine glasses were never empty and that all of our needs were met. His genuine care and attention to detail made us feel pampered and further enhanced our dining experience. To conclude the meal, we decided to indulge in dessert and shared the flourless chocolate cake. Much like the rest of the meal, this culinary masterpiece melted in our mouths and left us in awe of the chef's skill. In summary, our experience at The Gourmet Bistro was nothing short of extraordinary, and it's not difficult to understand why this establishment is a local favorite. From the warm welcome we received upon arrival and the impeccable service, to the exquisitely prepared dishes, every aspect of our evening was an example of excellence. We will undoubtedly recommend The Gourmet Bistro to friends and family and can't wait to return for another memorable dining experience. Rating: 5 / 5"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you press it, it makes a clicking sound. These are available online or in pet stores, and they cost as little as 1. These are commonly used to train dogs and cats. It's best to use a clicker specifically designed for training. If you don't have one, though, make a distinct clicking noise with your mouth, or you can use a pen that makes a clicking sound. If your cat is deaf, you can use a pen light to achieve the same results. In order for the training to work, you need to give your cat a reward. A common reward is a special treat of some sort (e.g., tuna or deli turkey), and it should be something that can be given instantly to reward behavior. If the treat is food, it should be cut up into pea-sized chunks. Some cats might respond well to affection or a toy. Use a stick-like object, such as a pen or a spoon. This item should be easily recognizable and used only for training. Your cat will eventually follow this object as a target, so you don't want your cat jumping up to the dinner table to follow her training spoon. You can make a target stick by putting a Ping-Pong ball on the end of a pencil or chopstick. Don't use the treat as the target. This will teach your cat to do tricks only when there is a treat involved. Eventually you'll want to be able to get your cats to do tricks without treats (though you should still reward with treats sporadically). Set aside about 5 minutes for each training session, and hold these sessions a few times a day. Wait until your cat is active and hungry (it should be at least 20-30 minutes until mealtime). He will be more interested in the treat and will respond better to the training. Start your training in a location that will be quiet and without distractions. If you have other pets around, try putting them outside or in a separate room while you work on training your cat.","completion":"The article explains the process of using a clicker, a target stick, and rewards to train cats, emphasizing on the tools required, the importance of choosing the right rewards and target, setting the duration and frequency of training sessions, and selecting an appropriate environment to ensure an effective and distraction-free training experience."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The Drew Carey Show is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1995 to 2004, and was set in Cleveland, Ohio, and revolved around the retail office and home life of \\"everyman\\" Drew Carey, a fictionalized version of the actor. The show was created by Carey, who had both stand-up comedy and writing experience, and Bruce Helford, who was once a writer for Roseanne. It was the first television show to have an episode simulcast on the Internet. Produced by Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, it debuted on September 13, 1995, and ranked among the Top 30 programs for four seasons before sliding in popularity. Beginning in season 8, the show rotated through 9 different opening sequences, each of which contained a new version of one of the show's three theme songs. Each theme (\\"Moon Over Parma\\", \\"Five O'Clock World\\" and \\"Cleveland Rocks\\") was seen in three different segments, in new, wildly different arrangements. The show eventually went back to having just five main characters, akin to the first season, as Kate, Mr. Wick, and Steve were eventually written out of the show. Kate's character was married off, Mr. Wick disappeared after three appearances until the Season 8 finale, wherein it is revealed he became a weatherman (although he continued to appear in the opening credits, unlike Kate, who was eliminated completely, and never mentioned again.) Steve left at the beginning of the ninth season to \\"find himself\\". With Winfred-Louder closed, the location became the office of online retailer Neverending Store. Drew, Mimi, and Mr. Wick were hired as employees of the new company. Mimi was hired first in a similar role to her old job, and Drew was eventually hired as \\"Internal Expediting Analyst\\", and a recurring gag began wherein Drew had no clue as to what his job entailed. Before being written out, Mr. Wick was at first a janitor, and another recurring joke came in the form of Mr. Wick attempting to climb the ladder back to being the boss. Before being written out, he went from janitor to the carrier of the dessert trolley. Kate left after the first two episodes of season 8, the same two episodes that introduced Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper. She eventually became a waitress at The Warsaw Tavern, Drew's girlfriend, and the carrier of his child. The plot of the final episode was Drew and Kellie attempting to get married before their child is born. Mr. Wick also returned and stayed on for the series finale. The show began featuring cameos from reality-TV participants in the final two seasons, such as former Road Rules star Timmy Beggy, The Real World alumna Cara Khan, and The Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl. Tony the Bus Driver (Bill Cobbs) became a regular, serving as smart-alecky \\"bartender\\" type to whom Drew could tell his problems. The eighth season was put in a timeslot that frequently clashed with Monday Night Football. It was pulled mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer of 2003. The ninth season did not air until the summer of 2004, with most of the episodes out of order. The last season's tone changed radically from the previous seasons. The directors began experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing the sets completely built, with four walls in most rooms, and with rooms actually linked together. The writers also began experimenting, including story lines in which Gus burns down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew after Steve leaves her.","completion":"This text is about \\"The Drew Carey Show,\\" an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1995 to 2004.

Here is a news article: A new free online course offered through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gives students the opportunity to use math and applied theory to get better at playing poker. The class is taught by finance graduate student Kevin Desmond. It’s part of MIT’s OpenCourseWare program, which opens up course materials and video lectures from many of the school’s classes to the public. Why is MIT teaching poker? The course comes out of MIT’s Sloan business school, and the course description says poker theory and analysis can be applied to investment management and trading. Terminology and strategy is covered in eight lectures (you can watch the first one below. Learners who prefer printed material can check out the course notes. Some commenters have noted that the class might be best for poker novices, though the coursework becomes more challenging as it progresses. Beyond basics, like the benefits of sitting at different table positions, you will learn how to calculate odds using statistical probabilities. The class also requires that you practice your skills within online cardrooms—though you will be betting only fake cash, not the real thing.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the premier engineering schools in the country, is finally putting math to good use: teaching students how to be better poker players. MIT has opened up the course \\"Poker Theory and Analytics\\" for free to the public this summer, including videos of class lectures, the syllabus, and PDFs of course notes. This course is part of MIT’s OpenCourseWare initiative, which seeks to make certain courses at the school available for free, even for non-MIT students. The class is taught by Kevin Desmond, a graduate student in the school’s finance department. As fitting his background, his lectures emphasize careful strategy and data analysis to get the best return on investment in a given game. Desmond wants his beginner students to play “tight aggressive\\": betting and raising often, but rarely just calling others’ bets. The focus of the class is two-fold: mastering the fundamentals while also tracking factors other players aren’t. Students in the class use poker tracking software to do everything from analyzing optimal seating arrangements to tracking opponents’ betting and raising patterns and inferring future behavior based on past hands dealt. Desmond taught the class this past winter session, and was the one to actually push for it to be made available under the OpenCourseWare project this summer. As a lesson in risk analysis, poker is an excellent teacher, and MIT is no stranger to combining math concepts with card games. The unofficial MIT Blackjack Team gained notoriety for counting cards and winning big at casinos in the 90s, and then had a Kevin Spacey movie made about them.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: The seats were designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing, where were they seats located? Possible A: bowling alley, space shuttle, auditorium, rest area, beach Why is \\"space shuttle\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Space shuttle\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because the seats referred to are designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing, which suggests that these seats are intended for a specific purpose with special requirements. In the context of the given alternatives, the most logical option would be a place where people are expected to wear bulky and restrictive clothing due to specific environmental or safety needs. A space shuttle requires astronauts to wear bulky spacesuits for safety, as they protect them from the harsh conditions of space. These suits are cumbersome and restrict movement, so the seats must be designed to comfortably accommodate both the astronaut and the equipment. This makes the space shuttle the most sensible and aligned answer among the given options: 1. Bowling alley: While some people may wear special bowling shoes, the clothing requirements are not particularly cumbersome or restrictive. 2. Auditorium: In general, there are no special clothing requirements for attending events in an auditorium, and people can wear regular clothing. 3. Rest area: These areas are typically designed for casual and comfortable use and do not require any specific or cumbersome clothing. 4. Beach: Most people wear lightweight and casual clothing at the beach, so there is no need to design seating for bulky attire. Comparing the four other options, none of them are as likely to have seats designed for accommodating cumbersome clothing as the space shuttle.

The South Korean firm announced the feature at the global launch event for the G3 handset, held in London.\` The technology is designed to let the Android-powered device's camera focus in dim light conditions and quickly lock onto moving objects. Experts praised the innovation, but suggested its effect on the firm's global sales ranking would be limited. \\"Handsets are becoming harder to identify just from the way they look,\\" said Jasdeep Badyal from the telecoms consultancy CCS Insight. \\"A device needs to have some standout features so that when a consumer goes into a store the retailer can explain what makes it different from other smartphones. \\"But it will still be a difficult battle for LG, particularly because of the bigger marketing budgets that Samsung, Apple and Sony have.\\" LG nearly doubled its handset sales to consumers from 2.6 million smartphones in 2012 to 4.6 million in 2013, according to tech research firm Gartner. However, over the same period the South Korean's smartphone market share only rose from 3.8% to 4.8%, with it remaining in fourth place behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei. The G3 features a 5.5in (14cm) screen with 538 pixels per inch making it bigger and higher resolution than both its predecessor, the G2, and Samsung's S5. LG compared the \\"quad HD\\" branded screen as offering a similar level of detail to a high quality art book and added that it had taken steps to limit the extra toll this upgrade would take on battery life. However the device's main 13 megapixel rear camera has a lower resolution than Samsung's. But the camera is enhanced by the Laser Auto Focus function, which LG said allowed it to focus in 0.276 of a second - faster, it said, than a human's brain signals take to reach their hand. It works by sending out a low-powered laser beam that allows the device to measure its distance from the photo's subject more accurately than \\"phase detection\\" - the analysis of contrast and the focus-assist lamps used by some other devices. \\"I remember Sony's early attempts at laser-guided autofocus, over a decade ago, said Jon Devo, technical writer at Amateur Photographer magazine. \\"It was also referred to as 'Hologram AF' and worked similarly to how an auto focus-assist beam on modern digital cameras works. \\"One of the advantages of having an assist beam or laser is that it can help focus in extremely low light and even in total darkness, although the method was typically slow. \\"If the LG G3 can do that effectively and at speed, it could be a game-changing feature in mobile phone photography.\\" Other innovations announced by LG included the ability to trigger a photograph by making a hand gesture at the phone, which triggers a short countdown before the shot is taken. The firm suggested that this made the device ideal for \\"selfies\\". However, it will face competition from Huawei for this accolade. The Chinese firm unveiled its P7 handset last month, which features an 8MP front camera - significantly more than the 2.1MP in LG's machine.","completion":"LG's new G3 phone has a special camera that uses a laser to focus quickly on moving objects and work well in dim light, making it a good choice for taking fun pictures!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem. Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside. \\"Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low. It lies in a valley so there's not so much wind.

This station is managed and directed by Jeff Dugan, who has successfully built a large fan base through the strategic employment of charismatic DJ personalities that play popular rock and roll music. This approach has helped Q-SKY achieve the top spot in the ratings, making it highly popular among listeners. Q-SKY's success can be attributed to the experience and knowledge Jeff Dugan has gained from his background in the radio industry, as well as the influence of real-life radio program directors such as Mike Herrington from the renowned KMET radio station in Los Angeles. Herrington's expertise in the field serves as an inspiration for Jeff Dugan in adopting best practices to drive Q-SKY's popularity.

Summarize: Egg theft had become such a problem on remote islands off Poole Harbour that police patrols were put in to protect the seabirds this year. Charity, Birds of Poole Harbour, said a survey carried out on Tuesday revealed \\"zero evidence\\" of thefts by poachers. Just over 2,500 out of 9,000 nests were left following egg thefts last year. More on this and other stories from across the South of England Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said the colony was back up to nearly 6,000 nests. He said: \\"We're thrilled. We saw our first chicks too which means that the eggs are now beyond the picking stage.\\" The eggs from black-headed and Mediterranean gulls - considered a delicacy - are stolen in April and May for their exclusivity and high price tag, and are often used in top restaurants. The charity said it planned to continue to monitor the seabirds year on year and hoped to see the colony \\"recover and grow\\". There were around 20 \\"pickers\\" operating under licenses issued by Natural England, which allows black-headed gull eggs to be collected legally at five sites in England. No one is licensed to collect the eggs in Dorset. Summary:","completion":"Egg theft on remote islands off Poole Harbour has led to police patrols protecting seabirds this year.

Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with.

Title: Westworld Movie plot: It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others.

Article:","completion":"Title: Maintaining Your Boat Engine: Flushing and Checking After Every Outing Introduction A well-maintained boat engine ensures optimal performance and a longer life for your boat. One crucial aspect of engine maintenance is flushing out the engine after every outing. By doing this, you can prevent corrosion, eliminate salt and debris, and keep your engine in top working condition. In this article, we will guide you through the process of flushing your boat engine at home, along with additional checks and care techniques to ensure its longevity. Step 1: Flush Out the Engine After Every Outing Flushing your engine after every outing is important, especially if you've been boating in saltwater. Salt can cause corrosion and damage to the internal components of the engine. To flush the engine, follow these steps: 1. Connect a garden hose to the flushing attachment provided by the manufacturer. 2. Turn on the water supply. 3. Start the engine and let it run for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow the water to circulate and flush out any salt and debris. Step 2: Check the Water Pump for Good Water Flow While the motor is being flushed, take the time to check the water pump to ensure it's providing a good water flow. The water pump plays a crucial role in keeping your engine cool by circulating water through the system. A steady stream of water exiting the engine indicates a properly functioning water pump. If the flow is weak or nonexistent, you may need to replace the impeller or have the pump serviced. Step 3: Disconnect the Fuel Line and Turn Off Key and Battery Switch After flushing the engine, remember to disconnect the fuel line (if applicable). This will prevent any fuel from leaking into the engine compartment. Also, be sure to turn off the key and, if your boat has a battery switch, turn it off as well to conserve battery life. Step 4: Remove Engine Cowling and Check for Leaks With the engine off, carefully remove the engine cowling to get a good view of the engine. Inspect the area for any signs of fuel or water leaks. Finding and addressing leaks early can prevent costly repairs down the line. Step 5: Wipe Down and Spray Mechanical Components with an Anti-Corrosive Once you've checked for leaks, it's a good time to clean and protect the engine. Wipe down all accessible mechanical components and moving parts with a clean cloth. Afterward, spray these parts with an anti-corrosive to help prevent rust and corrosion. This will keep your engine looking and running like new for a longer time. Step 6: Replace the Engine Cowling Finally, place the engine cowling back onto its fittings and ensure it is securely in place. This will protect the engine from dust and water damage. Conclusion Performing these steps after every outing is important for the health of your boat engine. By regularly flushing the engine, checking the water pump's functionality, inspecting for leaks, and protecting mechanical components, you can ensure that your boat stays in top working condition for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly.

In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... What is probably true about the author?

Given the context: What does Austin need to do before? The answer is:","completion":"Before Austin goes to the ice cream parlor to meet Sasha for their date, there are several preparations and tasks he may need to complete to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. Some of these tasks include: 1. Confirming the date and time with Sasha: To avoid potential miscommunication or misunderstandings, Austin should make sure to confirm the exact date, time, and location of their ice cream parlor meeting with Sasha. This will also give Sasha the opportunity to make any necessary arrangements or adjustments to her schedule. 2. Researching the ice cream parlor: Before the date, Austin should take the time to research the ice cream parlor they plan to visit. Gathering information such as the address, hours of operation, menu options, and any customer reviews can help Austin make informed decisions and ensure they have a pleasant experience. 3. Personal grooming and hygiene: Austin should also pay attention to his personal grooming and hygiene in preparation for the date. This may involve showering, shaving, brushing his teeth, trimming his nails, and putting on deodorant. Doing so will help him feel more confident and presentable when meeting Sasha. 4. Choosing an appropriate outfit: Depending on the setting and atmosphere of the ice cream parlor, Austin should choose an outfit that matches the occasion. This might involve selecting clean, well-fitting clothes that make him feel comfortable and confident. If the ice cream parlor is more casual, then jeans and a nice shirt may suffice; if it's a bit more upscale, he may want to opt for slacks and a button-down shirt. 5. Planning potential conversation topics: Though conversation should flow naturally during their time together, Austin might want to think about a few topics or questions to bring up during their date. This can help to break the ice and avoid any awkward silences that may occur. 6. Planning contingency options: In case the ice cream parlor is unexpectedly crowded or closed, Austin should have a backup plan in mind. This may involve researching nearby cafes or dessert shops that they could visit instead, or even suggesting a walk around a nearby park or neighborhood to enjoy their ice cream. 7. Checking the weather forecast: Weather can play a significant role in the overall enjoyment of the date. Austin should check the weather forecast beforehand to determine if any adjustments need to be made, such as bringing an umbrella in case of rain or layering clothing for cooler temperatures. 8. Charging his phone and bringing any necessary items: To prevent unforeseen inconveniences, Austin should ensure his phone is charged and has all necessary apps or information readily available. Additionally, he might want to bring along essentials such as his wallet, keys, and a mask, if needed. By taking care of these tasks before meeting with Sasha at the ice cream parlor, Austin can ensure he is well-prepared for their date and greatly improve the chances of providing a positive and memorable experience for both parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The bond has forced him to accept a post to the tiny school at Tiboonda, a remote township in the arid Australian Outback.

New York (CNN) -- Six protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested early Wednesday in New York's Union Square Park during a confrontation with police, authorities said. The demonstrators were arrested after they were asked to vacate the lower Manhattan park at midnight, according to New York Police Department spokesman Detective Marc Nell. \\"Protesters were asked to leave because of sanitary reasons. We had people coming in to clean the park. Arrests were made because the protesters were blocking pedestrian traffic,\\" Nell said. There were six charges of disorderly conduct, four charges of obstructing government administration, one charge of resisting arrest and one charge of violation of local law, the spokesman said. \\"The occupation at Union Square is considered the first 24-hour occupation since our November 15th eviction from","completion":"Zuccotti Park,\\" a statement from the Occupy Wall Street movement read. The statement condemned the arrests, claiming that the protesters had a right to remain in the park. As tensions between the protesters and the police continued to escalate, both sides tried to find a solution that would satisfy their concerns. The Occupy Wall Street movement sought legal counsel, while the police department insisted that the arrests were made within the bounds of the law. After weeks of negotiations and court hearings, a judge ruled that the protesters did have a right to maintain a presence in Union Square Park but needed to adhere to specific guidelines for sanitary and safety reasons. The judge also ordered that regular cleaning of the park could continue, but the protesters would need to provide unhindered access to the cleaning crews. In response to the ruling, the Occupy Wall Street movement decided to alter their strategy. They designated specific areas for protests within the park, and committed to abiding by the new guidelines outlined by the court order. This allowed the peaceful protests to continue without disrupting the park's maintenance or causing any more arrests. The new arrangement seemingly improved the relationship between the protesters and the police. The Occupy Wall Street movement continued to gain momentum, and their message inspired people from all walks of life to come out and support their cause. As months passed, the protest evolved into a larger social movement that included several other related causes. Union Square became a hub of activism and community engagement. Eventually, the protests spread beyond New York City, with similar demonstrations taking place in major cities across the country. The long-lasting impact of the Occupy Wall Street movement brought about real change in the social and political landscape, sparking debates about income inequality, corporate influence, and social justice. The story ends with the movement's legacy living on as a reminder of the power of people uniting for a common cause. And although the specific Occupy Wall Street protests may have subsided, their influence and the issues they raised continue to be present in political discourse today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When we look at unemployment, the minister is boasting of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, which he is putting toward reduction of the deficit, when we look at the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus, the restrictions to the new employment insurance program, we see that this is no joke. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? they have fantastic surpluses in the unemployment fund","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, we can conclude that the minister is indeed boasting about fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund. The paragraph states that \\"the minister is boasting of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, which he is putting toward reduction of the deficit.\\" This line clearly mentions the presence of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment fund and the minister taking pride in this achievement. However, it is important to note that the paragraph also discusses restrictions that have contributed to the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund. Specifically, the paragraph mentions \\"restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus\\" and \\"restrictions to the new employment insurance program.\\" These statements indicate that the surplus may not be the result of exceptional management or positive economic conditions, but rather due to limitations imposed on the unemployment and employment insurance programs that potentially restrict access to benefits for those in need. Furthermore, the paragraph implies that this situation is not a joking matter, likely because of the potential impacts on individuals who are facing unemployment and require financial support through insurance programs. The statement \\"we see that this is no joke\\" suggests that there may be negative consequences for those affected by these policies. In summary, while it is true that the minister is boasting of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, it is crucial to consider the wider context presented in the paragraph regarding the restrictions and potential implications for those in need of support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.

This classic nursery rhyme dates back to the 18th century and has seen many modified versions throughout the years. However, the character of the priest remains an integral part of the narrative despite these various adaptations. To understand the priest's portrayal in the nursery rhyme, let's first examine the structure and content of the rhyme, as it provides the context in which the priest appears. \\"The House That Jack Built\\" begins with the titular house and adds a new character or object with each subsequent verse, connected to the previous characters or elements in a cumulative manner. Here is the part of the nursery rhyme where the priest is introduced: \\"This is the priest all shaven and shorn, That married the man all tattered and torn, That kissed the maiden all forlorn, That milked the cow with the crumpled horn, That tossed the dog, That worried the cat, That killed the rat, That ate the malt That lay in the house that Jack built.\\" The priest is introduced as \\"all shaven and shorn\\" in the rhyme. This phrase can be broken down into two parts to grasp its meaning: 1. \\"Shaven\\": This word specifically refers to the priest's clean-shaven facial appearance. In the historical context, a clean-shaven face often denoted an adherence to the Church's teachings, as facial hair was not always looked upon favorably in certain religious circles. The lack of facial hair signifies his commitment to religious duties and his pious nature. 2. \\"Shorn\\": This term indicates that the priest has cropped or short-cut hair, likely in the form of the traditional tonsure hairstyle. Tonsures were often worn by members of the Christian clergy as a symbol of humility, obedience, and submission to their spiritual calling. Based on these descriptions, the priest in the nursery rhyme is a character who adheres to the traditional appearance of a pious clergyman. The priest's role in the story, as mentioned previously, is to marry \\"the man all tattered and torn\\" to \\"the maiden all forlorn.\\" His presence in the rhyme signifies his main function as a spiritual and religious figure for the community. In conclusion, the priest in the nursery rhyme \\"The House That Jack Built\\" is described as a devoted and solemn character, conforming to the standard image of a religious clergy member. He is clean-shaven and wears a tonsure hairstyle, reflecting his commitment to spiritual duty and church traditions. The priest plays a crucial role in the rhyme by marrying the man and the maiden, underlining the importance of religious rituals in the characters' lives."},{"prompt":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

For former Sky Sports presenters, Andy Gray and Richard Keys, a series of sexist remarks and inappropriate conduct ultimately led to their dismissal from Sky Sports, tainting their careers and leaving a lasting impact on sports journalism. The incident, which took place in the early 2000s, came to light on camera when Gray and Keys were seen speaking to their colleague and fellow sports journalist Clare Tomlinson. The pair were caught wolf-whistling and chanting “Get your t**s out for the lads,” while the cameras were rolling, a raucous display that demonstrated a lack of respect and decorum towards their female peer. The video’s authenticity was later confirmed by Sky, who were faced with a significant PR crisis following the emergence of these shocking details. As the controversy unfolded, an internal investigation by Sky Sports highlighted that it was not the first time that Gray and Keys had made derogatory remarks about their female colleagues. Sian Massey, a respected female official, was also a victim of the pair’s blatant sexism, enduring a slew of disparaging comments that targeted her abilities as an official and her place in the sport as a woman. To make matters worse, Gray was later found to have made an inappropriate gesture towards Charlotte Jackson, another Sky Sports employee. In response to these findings, Sky Sports made the decision to terminate the employment of both Andy Gray and Richard Keys, a move that sent shockwaves through the sports journalism world. The company was faced with immense pressure to take decisive action and demonstrated their commitment to promoting a culture of respect, equality, and inclusivity in the workplace. The fallout from the incident had far-reaching consequences for both Gray and Keys, as well as the wider sports industry. As high-profile figures in the world of football, their actions prompted a broader conversation about the presence of sexism in the sport, as well as the treatment of women in the workplace. It served as a stark reminder that sexism, in any form, would not be tolerated and that, no matter the stature, every individual should be held accountable for their actions. Several years on, the repercussions of their offensive conduct and dismissal from Sky Sports still resonate today. As a result, major organizations across the industry are now taking a more proactive approach in promoting and enforcing policies that ensure inclusivity, gender equality, and mutual respect in the workplace. In summary, the sacking of Andy Gray and Richard Keys from Sky Sports due to their sexist remarks and inappropriate behavior towards female colleagues has had a lasting impact on sports journalism and the culture within the industry. The incident exemplifies the importance of maintaining a culture of professionalism, respect, and equality in the workplace and it has, above all, served as a powerful reminder that actions have consequences, even for well-known personalities."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically as category: unacceptable All categories: Choose from: -- unacceptable. -- acceptable.","completion":"Here's an example of an English sentence that would fall under the category of \\"unacceptable\\" in terms of grammar: \\"Me like to plays with ball and toy lot.\\" This sentence reflects a handful of common grammar mistakes that result in it being classified as \\"unacceptable.\\" Firstly, the pronoun \\"Me\\" is inappropriate in this context. English grammar rules dictate the use of \\"I\\" at the beginning of sentences when referring to oneself. \\"Me\\" is an object pronoun, used when the action is being done to the pronoun. (E.g., \\"She gave me the ball.\\") In our problematic sentence, \\"I\\" should replace \\"Me\\". Secondly, the verb \\"play\\" is incorrectly inflected with an \\"s\\" in \\"plays.\\" The plural form of the verb does not correspond to \\"I,\\" which is a singular first-person pronoun. English grammar rules require verbs to agree in number with their subjects, a principle known as subject-verb agreement. When a sentence's subject is singular, plural verbs should not be used, and vice versa. In this case, a singular noun (\\"I\\") requires a singular verb. Thus, \\"plays\\" should be changed to \\"play.\\" Thirdly, the words \\"ball\\" and \\"toy\\" should be preceded by the definite article \\"the\\" or the indefinite article \\"a\\" as it sounds largely natural in English to use these articles before singular, countable, and specific nouns. The articles could also help specify whether the object is known to both the speaker and the listener or not. Lastly, the phrase \\"toy lot\\" is unclear and most likely incorrect. If the implied meaning is \\"a lot of toys,\\" then the phrase should be properly modified. After correcting these grammar errors, an acceptable sentence might read, \\"I like to play with the ball and a lot of toys.\\" Grammatical acceptability is vital for constructing comprehensible sentences in English or any other language. It ensures the clarity of communication and allows the listener or reader to understand the speaker's or writer's intended message accurately. Understanding this can help learners of English or any language strengthen their ability to communicate effectively."},{"prompt":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less glucagon in blood happens, how will it affect MORE regulation of blood sugar level being needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If there is less glucagon in the blood, it could have an effect on the MORE regulation (maintenance, optimization, response, and evaluation) of blood sugar levels because the body may not be able to properly respond to low blood sugar situations. Let's discuss how this perturbation could potentially impact the process in more detail. 1. Maintenance: With less glucagon available, the body's ability to maintain the blood sugar levels within a normal range might be compromised. This could lead to more frequent occurrences of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and can potentially cause serious consequences if blood sugar levels drop too low. 2. Optimization: Less glucagon in the blood could also lead to a less effective optimization of glucose production and release by the liver. The liver might take longer to respond to low blood sugar signals and convert stored glycogen into glucose, making it difficult for the body to optimize blood sugar control and maintain it within the desired range. 3. Response: The body's response to low blood sugar situations could also be negatively affected. If there's not enough glucagon available, the pancreatic cells might not release an adequate amount of the hormone to stimulate the liver's glucose production efficiently. This could result in a slower or inadequate response to low blood sugar, which can be dangerous. 4. Evaluation: Lastly, the perturbation could have an effect on the evaluation of blood sugar regulation. It could be more challenging to accurately assess the overall efficacy of the body's blood sugar control mechanisms due to the reduced glucagon levels. This might make it difficult to determine whether the body is effectively managing blood sugar levels and responding appropriately to low blood sugar signals. In summary, if there is less glucagon in the blood, it could have both direct and indirect effects on the MORE regulation process of blood sugar levels. This perturbation could compromise the body's ability to effectively maintain, optimize, respond, and evaluate blood sugar regulation, which could possibly lead to more frequent incidences of low blood sugar and accompanying complications."},{"prompt":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence.

If one combined peppercorns with the instrument designed to crack and crush - I can honestly say that while it 's a lot of work - and you * will * get peppercorns jumping out of the mortar and going _ everywhere _ - freshly cracked pepper has a quality that even pepper straight out of the mill can not beat . What may be the point of the story ? Available choices: [a]. None of the above choices . [b]. They do n't like the alternative they came up with . [c]. They want people to start planning ahead . [d]. They started using peppercorn as a last resort when they did n't have pepper .","completion":"The point of the story is [d]. They started using peppercorn as a last resort when they did n't have pepper. In the text, the author shares their experience of misplacing their pepper mill during a move and beginning to rely on ready-to-use pepper from the supermarket. However, they found themselves out of pepper once again a few months later. In a moment of inspiration, they decided to use their unused mortar to crack and crush peppercorns as a substitute for ground pepper. Despite it being a lot of work and peppercorns jumping everywhere, the author comes to realize that freshly cracked pepper has a unique, superior quality compared to even the pepper straight out of the mill. This story emphasizes the discovery of a new solution due to an unexpected situation (being out of pepper), and it highlights the benefits of trying alternative methods. In this case, using peppercorns combined with the mortar resulted in the more flavorful and higher-quality seasoning, providing a better overall experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Albert Lee Ueltschi was enshrined at Dayton, Ohio along with which American pilot who served in the United States Air Force and test pilot for the North American X-15 program? A:","completion":"Albert Lee Ueltschi was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, alongside Joe H. Engle, an American pilot who served in the United States Air Force and later became a test pilot for the North American X-15 program (among other aviation feats). Joe H. Engle, born in 1932, was a renowned pilot with a long and distinguished career in aviation. He enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1955 and eventually became an officer and a pilot. During his time in the Air Force, Engle served as a combat pilot, flying F-100s in the 474th Fighter Day Wing based in Bitburg, Germany. Later in his career, Engle joined NASA as a test pilot for the X-15 program, where he became only the second pilot to qualify as an astronaut by exceeding the 50-mile altitude threshold (his highest altitude reached was 280,600 feet). The X-15 was an experimental hypersonic aircraft which, to this day, retains the record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned, powered aircraft. Engle went on to be a key participant in the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. He was a part of the backup crew for Apollo 14 and was the commander of the Space Shuttle Enterprise during its approach and landing test (ALT) program in 1977. He also commanded STS-2, the second orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1981, and STS-51I, a Space Shuttle Discovery mission in 1985. In addition to his achievements in test flights and space programs, Engle has flown over 185 types of aircraft and has accumulated more than 14,700 flight hours. Albert Lee Ueltschi and Joe H. Engle were both enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame for their significant accomplishments and contributions to aviation history. The prestigious hall of fame, located at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, was founded in 1962 to honor American aviators who have made lasting impacts in the world of flight. The Hall's enshrinees include notable figures like the Wright brothers, Amelia Earhart, and Charles Lindbergh, making it a great honor for both Ueltschi and Engle to be part of this elite group."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Chris Hughton says that the FA are now serious about increasing the number of black and ethnic minority managers in football – but he wants to see substantive results in terms of appointments rather than good intentions. Hughton, who with Chris Powell and Keith Curle is one of only three black managers in the game, despite 25 per cent of players coming from black and minority backgrounds, takes on Arsenal in the FA Cup on Sunday having been appointed by Brighton at the turn of the year. And the former Norwich manager said: ‘I see a real enthusiasm from the stakeholders in our game, the PFA, certainly the FA and the LMA to address some of the imbalances. I think we're seeing an upturn in the number of black and ethnic potential coaches wanting to participate in courses and that's certainly a way to go. But it's about transparency as well, making sure that black and ethnic coaches are in a position to be interviewed for jobs and of course getting transparency in feedback from clubs. Chris Hughton's Brighton take on Premier League side Arsenal in the FA Cup Fourth Round on Sunday. Chris Powell, along with Hughton and Keith Curle, is one of only three black managers in the game. ‘As I said, there's a real enthusiasm and it's how you act upon that. If we're hearing things like that from the FA, then it's their responsibility to see that that comes into practice.’ But Hughton is not a supporter of the ‘Rooney Rule’, a stipulation by the NFL in the USA the football teams had to interview at least one minority candidate for any coaching position to increase diversity. ‘I understand and respect the reasoning for the Rooney Rule’ said Hughton. ‘They saw, similar to here, an under-representation of black coaches at the higher level. I've spoken about a, I think, real enthusiasm to change that. And if we can change that without legislation that's the best way. ‘I'm always conscious of my role and it's something that I'm very proud to do. When you speak to potential black and ethnic coaches that want to go into the game, one aspect that they always speak about are of course role models in the game. They would like to see representation, more at higher level. And any part I can play in that I am delighted to do.’","completion":"Chris Hughton, a football manager, says the Football Association (FA) wants to increase the number of black and minority managers in football.

Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police.

What Remains - TV review Complex despite the cliches … David Threlfall as Detective Len Harper in What Remains. Photograph: Laurence Cendrowicz/BBC Nothing here on the television event of the weekend, I'm afraid. I'm talking about Prince William opening up about fatherhood and saving rhinos. There was no review copy available in time for old-fashioned G2 print deadlines. I expect the palace was being quite strict and controlling about letting anything go before it was all perfect and polished. Especially don't give anything to the ghastly man on that ghastly republican rag … So what remains? What Remains (BBC1, Sunday), the conclusion thereof, that's what. But I was on holiday for the start, I haven't seen any of it … [Four hours later, numb, exhausted, physically, emotionally] I have now. Sat down and watched the whole thing, from beginning to end,, in one sitting. Binge TV it's known as, a phenomenon that's becoming increasingly common in this age of boxed sets/Netflix etc. Don't pretend you haven't done it, most probably with Breaking Bad, recently. It's not healthy, but it does mean you don't get fuddled between parts, and can get properly involved. I certainly did here – I felt like I'd pretty much moved in to No 8 Coulthard Street. Wow, what a place. It's eccentric and rather lovely on the outside, but was there ever a building that housed so many secrets, so much deceit, misery, suspicion, insecurity, bitterness, jealousy, cruelty, vengeance and hatred? All the way from the basement flat/dungeon of Joe Sellers (so good by David Bamber); up the stairs (those stairs!), past the doors behind which more secrets lurk – more prisoners, terrible relationships, goldfish flushed away in fits of rage etc; all the way up to the dark loft above flat 5, where Melissa Young's dried-out, no-longer fat body was discovered way back at the start. What Remains is different things at different times. To begin with, it's like one of those sad and only-too-common newspaper stories about people lying dead and unmissed for ages, a study in loneliness and the lack of community in modern urban life. God, only the other day my missus was suggesting asking some of our neighbours over for a drink, just to be friendly and to get to know a few people in the area. Yeah, but not if it means we're going to end up getting torn apart, used and our souls tortured, most probably strangled as well. I think I'd rather die alone and forgotten, thank you, under a cloud of flies. What Remains is not just a story of the unmissed, then. Because the other inhabitants of No 8 knew Melissa, intimately in some cases, and one of them was also responsible for her death. So now we're in detective-story territory. Not without the odd cliche of the genre – this is one final job before retirement for Detective Len Harper (also great by David Threlfall), who is lonely, a maverick, with a bit of a drink problem. We'll forgive the cliches, though, because the characters are so complex, interesting and well played, and so much is original and unusual. It may be a whodunit, but there are big questions about what it is, what was dun, as well as who by. And so to the finale then. Len's moved into dead Melissa's flat, the crime scene, rather unprofessionally (having retired, he shouldn't be there at all). Patricia dumps Keiron, her boyfriend. Keiron dumps Adam, his own son. \\"I don't know who you are,\\" he says. Elaine meanwhile encourages girlfriend/prisoner Peggy to kill herself in the bath. \\"Well get on with it, we haven't got all day,\\" she says. And Joe's ex-pupil/prisoner Liz tells Vidya what's she's been up to with Vidya's husband Michael: \\"When you think he's going to work, he isn't,\\" she says. \\"He's inside me.\\" Ouch. Oh, and Liz killed someone else, before, I think. Bloody hell, literally. By the end, everyone's running up and down those stairs with knives, and bow-and-arrows, and ice, and babies, all trying to kill each other. Succeeding too. Having been such a slow burner, tense and gnawing, What Remains is now something between gothic horror and farce. With a rather unsatisfactory/implausible answer to the whodunit question, too. It's the old murder-mystery denouement problem. In trying to tie up its ends, others have come loose, so what you're left with is a bit of a frayed, knotty mess. Disappointing at the end then, but mainly because what came before had been so very good. And, I imagine, still way more interesting than anything coming out of Kensington Palace. I hope they never go out leaving little George with a retired policeman, even if he does have a baby monitor. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In this TV review of the series 'What Remains,' the author praises the complex characters and intricate storylines, despite some cliches. Taking place in a large building filled with deceit, bitterness, and hatred, the show transitions from a study on loneliness and lack of community into a thrilling detective story.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Anaheim (pronounced ) is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th most populous city in California.

In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. - In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury, ineffectiveness, fatigue, ejection, or for other strategic reasons, such as being substituted by a pinch hitter. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, set-up relief pitchers, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched. A team's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team's bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game. - Lori Harrigan - Mack ( born September 5 , 1970 ) is an American , former collegiate All - American , right - handed hitting , left - handed softball pitcher originally from Anaheim , California . She was a three - time Olympic Champion as a member of the Team USA winning in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 . Harrigan played collegiately from 1989 -- 1992 at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas where she owns numerous records ; she is the Big West career leader in shutouts and innings pitched . - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - The International Softball Federation is the international governing body for the sport of softball. The ISF is a non-profit corporation recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and SportAccord (formerly the General Association of International Sports Federations). - In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. A pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. - The 2010 United States Census, (known as \\"Census 2010\\"), is the twenty-third and currently most recent United States national census. National Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2010. As part of a drive to increase the count's accuracy, 635,000 temporary enumerators were hired. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census. - The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) is a volunteer, non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was founded in 1933 with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA moved to Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966. - In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent innings, innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively. - A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games. - An inning in baseball, softball, and similar games is the basic unit of play, consisting of two halves or frames, the \\"top\\" (first half) and the \\"bottom\\" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full game typically is scheduled for nine innings, although this may be shortened due to weather or extended in the event that the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings.

Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Hint: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] A:","completion":"Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom because it is exposed to geothermal activity, which can cause the deeper water to be warmer than the surface water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stage Details The stage number, in this case, is 9, meaning that it is the ninth stage within the context of a multi-stage cycling event. Each stage represents a segment of the race during which participants are timed and ranked. Consequently, the accumulated results will determine the overall winner of the competition. The ninth stage, covering the route between Le Grand-Bornand and La Plagne, proffers a crucial test for cyclists.

He graduates from Harvard University with an MBA, and works at Morgenstern, a European investment bank, for two years. Hasumi returns to Japan to pursue high school teaching. However, his outward charm masks his true nature. In reality, Hasumi is a sociopath who is unable to feel empathy for other human beings. Specifically, he has a severe antisocial personality disorder. Having killed both of his parents and his former tutor at the age of fourteen, Hasumi turns into a fiendishly clever killer. During his time in the States, Hasumi meets a partner in crime, an American named Dave, who thinks he shares the same \\"hobby\\" as Hasumi killing people for fun. The two can be seen carrying buckets full of human blood, bones, and organs somewhere, giving off the notion that they committed numerous murders while working together. Hasumi eventually kills his partner by knocking him out and burning him alive inside a barrel, stating that while Dave enjoys killing for fun, Hasumi does not. Back in Japan, Hasumi chooses to deal with problems like bullying and student sexual harassment, starting by dealing with the school cheating issue. Upon collecting all of the students' cell phones prior to their exams, Hasumi secretly uses a cell phone jammer to completely prevent any cheating during the test. The group of students that had cheated on previous exams became suspicious after none of the group's cell phones have service during the test and immediately suspect the adviser of the Radio Club, Tsurii - a loner Physics teacher. They are then confronted by Tsurii himself who clarifies that he was not responsible for the jamming. A man who regularly meets with the school to complain about students bullying his daughter, Rina, is murdered. Someone has replaced the bottles of water he kept around his house to scare off cats with kerosene, as the man is a chainsmoker the bottles soon catch fire and explode. Tsurii soon meets with the intelligent ringleader of the cheating group, Keisuke, revealing his suspicions of Hasumi. Tsurii explains he has dug into Hasumi's past and found strange details, such as at another school where Hasumi started his teaching career that later had four student suicides. During this time, however, Hasumi had bugged the room and learned of Tsurii's suspicion, and confronts him on a train, murdering him and making his death appear as a hanging suicide. Hasumi then confronts Keisuke after the announcement of Tsurii's suicide causes him to panic. Hasumi knocks Keisuke out and ties him up until the end of school, after which Hasumi tortures him into admitting that he and his friends were indeed cheating. Hasumi checks that Keisuke didn't tell others of Tsurii's suspicions, before killing him and hiding his body. During the same time period, Hasumi is brought to the attention of a blackmail case from one of his students. A store owner, Meka, caught a female student, Miya, shoplifting but swears not to charge her for it. However, PE teacher Shibahara blackmails Miya, as he has recorded her admission of shoplifting, into giving him sexual favors or risk being charged. Hasumi, assures Miya that a blackmail and statutory rape case is more serious than shoplifting and affirms to her that she is safe from the law and no longer needs to succumb to the blackmail. Miya later meets Hasumi on the school roof, she thanks him with a hug that advances into a kiss and the two become lovers. In the meantime, Hasumi finds out about art teacher Kume's sexual relationship with a male student; he blackmails Kume into lending him his luxury apartment. Hasumi later takes Miya to the apartment and the two have sex. Hasumi presses Miya into giving him access to an online private discussion board that his students use, anonymously making claims about the murder of Rina's father, accusing delinquent student Tadenuma, who had targeted Rina online previously. After a fight breaks out at the school, Hasumi invites Tadenuma out for a drink and murders him; the students later assume that Tadenuma ran away from home.

Write a title for this article: The actress, who stars as a vice girl in The Deuce, was filming scenes in Harlem, New York MAGGIE Gyllenhaal donned a skimpy crochet bra top and hot pants as she filmed scenes for her latest drama The Deuce, ih which she plays a prostitute. The usually demurely dressed star showed off her fine physique in the outfit, which she was wearing for her role as a prostitute in the 70’s HBO drama. Shooting scenes in Harlem, in New York on Monday, the actress, 38, left little to the imagination in her get-up. She was seen leaning nonchalantly into a car, as she appeared to chat up a prospective customer in the role. The cream flannel high-waisted hotpants she wore showed off her slender pins, and her yellow crochet bikini top barely kept control of her cleavage. The raunchy streetwalker look was dramatically different from her red carpet style, which is effortlessly stylish and classy. Golden Globe Maggie, who plays hooker Eileen Merrell, who is also known as Candy, stopped to speak to crew as they took a break from filming. She had a beaded bag slung casually over her shoulder, and carried a silver jacket in her hands. However her footwear was less than glam as she strolled along the sidewalk, wearing a pair of black sliders. But she changed it up to a pair of strappy high heels for some of the scenes. In one she posed, looking bored with some other women, who were touting their wares for business in similar skimpy outfits. She also puffed languidly on a cigarette for another take. James Franco and Zoe Kazing are starring in the drama, which Maggie is also producing. The series focuses on life in New York in the late 70’s and 80’s when prostitution and porn were prevalent. It follows the legalization of the industry, as well as the rise of HIV and the cocaine epidemic. James is playing twin brothers in the show – who were big in the seedy world of adult entertainment which grew up around Times Square. He is also co-producing the project, which was written by David Simon and George Pelacanos, who worked on The Wire and Treme. Maggie meanwhile has moved from the big to the small screen to prove her acting chops. She won an Outstanding Actress Golden Globe for playing the role of Nessa Stein in The Honourable Woman.

Using the word \\"good\\" to describe the book indicates that the reviewer found it to be a high-quality and enjoyable read. 2. The statement, \\"I have been contemplating for a really long time before deciding to get this book,\\" suggests that the reviewer had some reservations or took time before finally deciding to purchase the book. This could be because they were unsure if the book was going to meet their expectations or match their preferences. However, the following line alleviates any doubts about their final assessment. 3. When the reviewer states, \\"It was worth it!\\", they express the feeling of satisfaction and assert that any time spent contemplating the purchase was justified in the end. This phrase is key to understanding the positive nature of the review, as it emphasizes the reviewer's sense of fulfillment after completing the book. 4.

Reverse pass through one stitch. Reverse pass through the rest of the row as usual. Repeat as needed.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Tunisian Simple Stitch: A Step-by-Step Guide Embarking on a journey through the world of crochet can be exceptionally rewarding. The creation process, from simple beginnings to a final product, is both certain to satisfy your creative yearnings and equip you with a host of utilitarian items. One foundational crochet technique that you must learn is the Tunisian simple stitch, often abbreviated as TSS. The Tunisian simple stitch, a staple in the Tunisian crochet repertoire, is characterized by its woven textures, offering an aesthetic intrigue that is distinct from traditional crochet. It is an excellent starting point for those wanting to venture into Tunisian crochet. The first step in mastering the Tunisian Simple Stitch is to work a preparation row. This step is crucial to set up the following rows and maintain uniformity in your work. Prepare your yarn and crochet hook, start by making a simple foundation chain of the length desired. Once completed, you are ready to proceed to the next phase. Once your foundation is in place, you should \\"chain two\\". This process involves yarning over the hook and drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this once more. Creating this extra pair of chains provides the necessary height for your initial stitch and provides a buffer to prevent your work from curling, a common characteristic in Tunisian crochet work. The next step involves a \\"forward pass into the second vertical bar\\". Specifically, insert the hook under the second vertical bar, the second strand of yarn that runs vertically from your hook, then yarn over and draw it through. This process effectively creates a new loop on your hook. This method should be repeated across the entire row, ensuring each stitch is uniform for the most consistent result. After working across the rest of the row, it's time for a \\"reverse pass through one stitch\\". To do this, yarn over and draw through the loop on the hook. This type of reverse pass is exclusive to the first stitch of the row; it's the exception to the 2-loops rule you'll follow for the rest of your work. Subsequently, it will be time for the \\"reverse pass through the rest of the row as usual\\". For this part, yarn over and draw through two loops on your hook. Repeat this action across the remaining loops on your hook until only one loop is left. This reverse pass will effectively define the stitch rows progressively. The beauty of the Tunisian simple stitch lies in its repetitive nature. You simply \\"repeat as needed\\", going through the steps of forward pass and reverse pass until your piece reaches the desired length or the pattern requires a shift in stitches. This process can be therapeutic while allowing you to perfect your rhythm and tension in each stitch. In conclusion, the Tunisian simple stitch is an exceptional starting point in your Tunisian crochet journey. Its simplicity and repetitive process complement the exquisite texture it creates, ensuring your finished items are stylishly distinctive and practical. Remember patience is key, as with each stitch mastered, you're one step closer to unveiling your project made with love and meticulous craftsmanship!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The water freezes into ice - The cracks expand - Over time the rocks split - The rocks are now in smaller pieces. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process described is \\"Water seeps into the cracks and pores of the rocks.\\" To provide a more detailed understanding of the overall process, known as freeze-thaw weathering or frost weathering, here is an elaboration of each step: 1. Water seeps into the cracks and pores of the rocks: In this initial stage, water infiltrates the tiny openings, crevices, and fractures present in rocks. This can occur due to various reasons, such as precipitation (e.g., rain, snow), melting ice or snow, or groundwater flow. The degree of water infiltration depends on factors such as rock porosity, permeability, and the existing climate. 2. The water freezes into ice: As temperatures drop below the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), the water trapped inside the rock cracks and pores begins to freeze and turn into ice. The process is faster in regions with colder climates, where freezing temperatures are more common and frequent. 3. The cracks expand: When the water freezes into ice, it expands by about 9% in volume. This increase in volume generates pressure within the existing cracks and gaps in the rocks, causing them to expand further. The force exerted by the expanding ice on the rock walls can be very powerful, and over time, this pressure causes the surrounding rock material to weaken and break. 4. Over time, the rocks split: As the freeze-thaw cycle is repeated over several instances, the continuous expansion and contraction of the ice within the rock cracks eventually cause the rocks to fracture and split. This process can occur over a long period, depending on the intensity and frequency of freezing and thawing cycles, the nature of the rock, and other factors such as slope angle, vegetation cover, and the presence of water. 5. The rocks are now in smaller pieces: Once the rocks have undergone the freeze-thaw process and split, they break down into smaller fragments. These smaller pieces can then be transported away through various erosion processes, such as water, wind, or gravity. The resulting smaller rock pieces can contribute to the formation of sediments, soil, and even provide habitats for various plant and animal life. In conclusion, the missing first step in the process is the infiltration of water into the cracks and pores of the rocks, which sets the stage for the subsequent freeze-thaw cycle and eventual breaking down of the rock through frost weathering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In both statements, the speaker is reflecting on a past event or observation that involved people working to make sod fly. The main difference is in the tone and phrasing of the expressions. The first statement, \\"Looks to me now, thinkin' it over, they was out to make sod fly\\" employs a more casual and informal tone with nonstandard grammar. The use of \\"thinkin'\\" instead of \\"thinking\\" and \\"was\\" instead of \\"were\\" reflect a colloquial language style. Additionally, \\"Looks to me now\\" and \\"out to\\" are phrasings that emphasize the speaker's personal perspective and experience. On the other hand, the revised statement, \\"Now that I think about it, they were trying to make sod fly\\" conveys the same overall idea, but in a more standard and polished tone. The grammar is corrected, with \\"were\\" replacing \\"was\\" and \\"think about it\\" replacing \\"thinkin' it over.\\" The phrase \\"Now that I think about it\\" serves as an expression of reflection and reconsideration, much like the original phrasing. Finally, by using \\"trying to make sod fly,\\" the revised statement communicates the intended purpose or effort of the people in question, as opposed to the more colloquial \\"out to make sod fly.\\" Thus, the two statements convey the same essential thought, despite differences in language and tone. It is appropriate to say that \\"Now that I think about it, they were trying to make sod fly\\" is a more polished and standard reformulation of the original, \\"Looks to me now, thinkin' it over, they was out to make sod fly.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To start the review, I will introduce the movie, the director, and mention its high rating and popularity as a basis for the positive review. Movie Review: The Shawshank Redemption Directed by Frank Darabont and based on the Stephen King novella, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" has stood the test of time to become one of the most beloved and highly rated movies in history. It's not hard to see why this powerful tale of friendship, hope, and redemption resonates with so many viewers. Step 3: Highlight the plot and themes. In order to provide a comprehensive review, I will give a brief overview of the plot and the themes explored in the movie. The film follows the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy forms an unlikely friendship with fellow inmate Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman). The bond they forge helps them both navigate the brutalities of prison life, and eventually leads them on a miraculous path towards freedom and redemption. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" tackles heavy themes such as injustice, the power of resilience, the significance of human connection, and the enduring strength of hope. Step 4: Discuss the acting. To emphasize the positive aspect of the review, I will praise the performances of the lead actors and the supporting cast. Tim Robbins delivers a powerful performance as Andy Dufresne, capturing the quiet determination of a man wrongly accused. Morgan Freeman, in one of his most iconic roles, brings wisdom, warmth, and depth to the character of Red. Their on-screen chemistry is undeniable and serves as the backbone of the movie. The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the cruel Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the sadistic Captain Hadley, also give memorable performances that add depth to the storytelling. Step 5: Comment on the technical aspects. Movies often benefit from skilled direction, cinematography, and musical scores. Mentioning these elements will strengthen the positive review. Frank Darabont’s masterful direction ensures that the film's pacing is just right, allowing the story to unfold naturally. The cinematography by Roger Deakins paints a vivid picture of the prison environment, from the grim walls of Shawshank to the beautiful outdoor scenes, giving the movie a contrast between the darkness of confinements and the hope of freedom. Moreover, the hauntingly beautiful score by Thomas Newman adds emotional depth to the narrative, making the movie even more captivating. Step 6: Conclude the review.

Premise: The music may seem strange to the unaccustomed ear. Hypothesis: The music is anything but normal. Justification: Both statements indicate that the music is not typical or normal. The premise statement is a bit less definitive, as it says the music \\"may seem strange,\\" whereas the hypothesis states outright that the music is \\"anything but normal.\\" However, the overall idea of the music being unusual is consistent between the two statements. Step 2: Compare statements related to the effects of the music on the listeners. Premise: The music won't put you to sleep, and cymbals and drums guarantee your alertness. Hypothesis: The music will make sure you can dance to the beat. Justification: The premise and the hypothesis have different specific points about the music's effects on listeners. The premise focuses on the music keeping the listener awake and alert, due to the presence of cymbals and drums. The hypothesis suggests that the music will enable the listener to dance to the beat. While both statements imply a lively or energetic quality to the music, they do not necessarily entail one another. It's possible for music to keep someone awake and alert without being danceable, and vice versa.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: In the 1920s, physicists discovered that electrons do not travel in fixed paths. In fact, they found that electrons only have a certain chance of being in any particular place. They could only describe where electrons are with mathematical formulas. That’s because electrons have wave-like properties as well as properties of particles of matter. It is the \\"wave nature\\" of electrons that lets them exist only at certain distances from the nucleus. The negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. However, because the electrons behave like waves, they bend around the nucleus instead of falling toward it. Electrons exist only where the wave is stable. These are the orbitals.

The answer is:","completion":"Bernie Madoff, the former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market and founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, was selling a fraudulent investment scheme known as a \\"Ponzi scheme.\\" This answer provides a summarized version of the information surrounding the revelation of Bernie Madoff's fraudulent activities: \\"On December 10, 2008, Madoff's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme, and quoted him as describing it as \\"one big lie.\\"\\" To provide a more detailed and long answer, we must explore the background, mechanics, and impacts of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Bernie Madoff began his investment business, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, in 1960. The firm started as a penny stock trader and later became a prominent market maker, involved in both proprietary trading and asset management. The asset management unit of the company was where Madoff operated his notorious Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment scam where earlier investors are paid returns out of the capital received from new investors, instead of profits earned by the business itself. The constant need for fresh funds to maintain payouts and the illusion of profitability leads these schemes to eventually collapse when there are not enough new investors or when many investors attempt to cash out. In Madoff's case, he lured investors with promises of high and consistent returns, typically around 10-12% annually. He targeted wealthy individuals, charities, and institutional investors. The illusion of a successful investment operation was maintained by generating fabricated account statements that displayed steady profits, even during periods of market downturns. The scheme operated for decades, eventually managing billions of dollars. However, it started to unravel as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investors began requesting redemptions. As the market conditions worsened, Madoff struggled to attract new investors to fund these payouts. In December 2008, Bernie Madoff confessed to his sons that the asset management unit was, in fact, a Ponzi scheme. His sons reported the confession to federal authorities on December 10, 2008. Bernie Madoff was arrested the following day and charged with securities fraud. The aftermath of Madoff's arrest was immense. Thousands of investors lost a significant amount of money, with the estimated losses around 65 billion at the scheme's peak. Numerous individuals and organizations experienced financial ruin as a result of their investments with Madoff. In June 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies, including securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He was subsequently sentenced to 150 years in prison. The case led to additional regulatory reforms and renewed focus on investor protection by the government and financial industry watchdogs. In conclusion, Bernie Madoff was selling a massive Ponzi scheme through the asset management unit of his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. His fraudulent actions led to billions lost for his investors and the eventual collapse of the scheme due to the financial crisis in 2008. Following his confession and his sons' report, Madoff was arrested and eventually sentenced to 150 years in prison for the numerous financial crimes he committed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 13 June walruses attacked and damaged the kayaks, causing another stop for repairs. On 17 June, as they prepared to leave again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, and a few minutes later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw \\"a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease\\". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: \\"You are Nansen, aren't you?\\", and received the reply \\"Yes, I am Nansen.\\"Johansen was rescued, and the pair taken to the base at Cape Flora, where they posed for photographs (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson–Nansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts. Both men seemed in good health, despite their ordeal; Nansen had put on 21 pounds (9.5 kg) in weight since the start of the expedition, and Johansen 13 pounds (5.9 kg). In honour of his rescuer, Nansen named the island where he had wintered \\"Frederick Jackson Island\\". For the next six weeks Nansen had little to do but await the arrival of Windward, worrying that he might have to spend the winter at Cape Flora, and sometimes regretting that he and Johansen had not pressed on to Spitsbergen.

Tommy holds up the cashier with a pistol while Rosie waited in the car she inherited from her father. Tommy is arrested and sent to prison for 18 months. In the meantime, Rosie gets a job at a debt collection agency run by Dave Lovell, who went to jail for bilking major companies out of 800,000 through fraudulent invoices. Lovell reformed his life and mainly hires ex-cons at his firm. He is happy to give Tommy a job and a second chance. Tommy is restless and instead of following the call script, he often counsels people on how to defraud Lovell's company. When Tommy sees some mafiosos in his neighborhood, he grows enraged. He calls them fat old guys living off their reputation, and he resents the way the mafia treated his father. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Tommy's father started his shop with a mafia loan, and he suffered frequent beatings when he was late with payments.

A new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor James Stewart teamed with the equally-brilliant director Anthony Mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future. Until that time Stewart was mainly noted for an aw..aw..aw approach to family oriented comedies, dramas, and romances. Not that he wasn't already a multi-talented Hollywood star. One of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as Macaulay 'Mike' Connor, a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in \\"The Philadelphia Story.\\" He had even done westerns before. His portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot Thomas Jefferson Destry Jr. in the comedy western \\"Destry Rides Again\\" helped make that film a classic. But to most movie goers he was the all-American boyscout type Mr. Smith or George Bailey. Seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played. Anthony Mann was associated with B flicks in the film noir mode. \\"Raw Deal,\\" \\"Side Street,\\" and \\"T-Men\\" caught the eye of James Stewart. So the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest Hollywood westerns ever made. \\"Winchester '73\\" and \\"The Man from Laramie\\" were the best but the others were almost as effective. Mann became a successful director of A films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all Gary Cooper's \\"Man of the West.\\" Stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid, a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on. Winchester '73 was also one of the first films, maybe the first, to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun. Each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie, which also holds a surprise for the viewer. Based on a story by Stuart Lake, the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the Winchester '73. The year is 1876. Custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the Sioux and Cheyenne at Little Big Horn. The whites want revenge. The native Americans want their land and their way of life back. This conflict leads to a confrontation between native Americas led by Young Bull (young Rock Hudson showing his potential as an actor) and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians Lin McAdam (Stewart), his partner and life-long pal High Spade ( the underrated actor Millard Mitchell), and a couple trying to find themselves, Steve Miller (Charles Drake) and Lola Manners (Shelley Winters), a soiled dove with a kind heart. Among the horse soldiers are newcomers Tony Curtis and James Best (late of the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\"), whose part is cut short by a bullet. Wyatt Earp was in Dodge City in 1876. The movie has him as head marshal. The fine actor Will Geer (later of the Waltons) looks like an older Earp. In reality Wyatt was assistant Marshal in Dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman. Lin McAdam wins the Winchester in a shooting contest, but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) and his henchmen. McAdam and High Spade are after both Dutch Henry and the Winchester for the remainder of the movie. An even more sinister character emerges along the way, Waco Johnnie Dean, played as evil personified by Dan Duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast. The Winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film, each time the transfer is intense. One involves a gunrunner played to perfection by John McIntire. Other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above. All this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show. As noted above, the cast is first rate down to the smallest role. Look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts, including the future sheriff of \\"Bonanza\\" Ray Teal and B western reliable Panhandle Perkins (Guy Wilkerson). Choose your answer.

Robert Gordon Orr, OC (born March 20, 1948) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. By the time Orr turned 16 in 1964, he was still two years away from playing in the NHL and his father Doug was dissatisfied with the Bruins' treatment of the prospect. Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed to work with the family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug. Eagleson was determined to get Orr a top salary. When Hap Emms, the general manager of the Bruins offered a US5,000 (US37,713 in 2017 dollars) signing bonus and US7,000 and US8,000 (US52,798 and US58,715 in 2017 dollars) for his first two years in the league, Eagleson countered with US100,000 (US754,256 in 2017 dollars) for the two years. or Orr would refuse to play with the Bruins and play for Canada's national team instead, like Carl Brewer. Orr wanted desperately to play in the NHL, but he went along with Eagleson's strategy and was willing to play for the nationals. The Bruins and Orr agreed on a US25,000 signing bonus (US188,564 in 2017 dollars), and a salary \\"less than 100,000\\" for the two years, a figure kept secret. Speculation has ranged on an annual salary of US25,000 to US40,000 (US188,564 to US339,415 in 2017 dollars) at a time when the typical maximum rookie salary was US8,000. (US60,341 in 2017 dollars) The official signing ceremony was done on Emms' boat, the Barbara Lynn, where Eagleson and Emms had conferred during negotiations. At the time, it made Orr the highest-paid player in league history. But beyond that, the signing became one of the most important in the history of professional hockey. Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey. Orr joined the Bruins for the 1966-67 season, his first as a professional. The Bruins were not convinced Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation. In that first season, Orr was challenged by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal tough guy Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees for the first time in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17-43-10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans. For the season, Orr scored 13 goals and 28 assists, one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history to that point by a defenceman. Orr won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's outstanding rookie and was named to the NHL's Second All-Star team. New York Rangers defenceman Harry Howell won the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenceman that year. In accepting the award, Howell said he was glad to win when he did, predicting \\"Orr will own this trophy from now on.\\" Orr was runner-up in voting. In 1969-70, Orr almost doubled his scoring total from the previous season, to 120 points, six shy of the league record (which had been set by his teammate Phil Esposito the previous season), leading the league in scoring. As of 2016, Orr is the only defenceman in history to win the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer, which he also achieved a second time, in 1974-75. In addition to the Norris and the Art Ross, Orr captured the first of three consecutive Hart Trophies as regular-season MVP and later won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his playoff performance, becoming the only player in history to win four major NHL awards in one season. Orr went on to lead the Bruins in a march through the 1970 playoffs scoring nine goals and 11 assists. The march culminated on May 10, 1970, when he scored one of the most famous goals in hockey history and one that gave Boston its first Stanley Cup since 1941. The goal came off a give-and-go pass with teammate Derek Sanderson at the 40-second mark of the first overtime period in the fourth game, helping to complete a sweep of the St. Louis Blues. According to Orr: If it had gone by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really trying to get the puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped. The subsequent photograph by Ray Lussier of a horizontal Orr flying through the air, his arms raised in victory - he had been tripped by Blues' defenceman Noel Picard after scoring the goal - has become one of the most famous and recognized hockey images of all time--and today is highlighted in the opening sequence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Hockey Night in Canada telecasts. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"This article mentions several interesting aspects of Bobby Orr's career.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of that which had become the most commonly used drilling fluid by 2009? ? Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons. As of 2009 these had become the most commonly used drilling fluids; eliminating the... The answer is:","completion":"Non-aromatic hydrocarbons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Allow me to elaborate on this choice. When Jordan discovers Jan's leather back, it may pique his interest due to various factors, such as its texture, appearance, or the stories it might hold. The leather back might belong to an item, such as a jacket, bag, book cover, or even a unique artifact. Consequently, this find would naturally spark Jordan's curiosity, leading him to wonder about the item's history or the person it belongs to.

The tribunal found that two members associated with the CPI had been unjustifiably expelled from the union. It also criticised Nipsa's \\"regular\\" record of sorting out internal grievances though tribunals. Its judgement said \\"the tribunal does not exist to provide a public forum for the periodic ventilation of obscure and internecine disputes within Nipsa\\". It added that \\"no other union appears to require this regular attention\\". The Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (Nipsa) has more than 45,000 members, mainly Civil Service staff and public sector employees. The judgement said the case was part of a dispute between two factions in the union which \\"has been a rich source of litigation over recent years\\". The factions are: 'unity', which is associated with the Marxist Leninist CPI, and the 'broad left' which is associated with various Trotskyite parties. The case involved two people who were employed as officials for other trade unions and then joined Nipsa. They were elected as officers and delegates in their Nipsa branch in 2015. Their right to membership of the union was queried by members associated with the broad left who also alleged the meeting at which they were elected had been \\"packed\\" by the CPI. The tribunal noted that \\"as Communist coups go, it was hardly the storming of the Winter Palace\\". The union leadership, which is dominated by the broad left, decided the two people were not eligible for membership as Nipsa does not represent employees of other trade unions. The two took a case to the tribunal alleging discrimination on the grounds of political opinion. However the tribunal said they had not shown that the two factions actually have any substantive political differences. It added that name-calling or trolling on social media is not sufficient to show political difference nor is \\"alleged adherence to Trotsky's 1938 Transitional Program\\". However the tribunal found they had nonetheless been unjustifiably expelled from the union. They claimants said they have suffered stress, insomnia and reputation damage as a result. However, the tribunal said it has seen no evidence of this, adding \\"the claimants nor any representative of the respondent trade union evinced any degree of stress or upset during the hearing\\". \\"To the contrary everybody involved, and their supporters, showed every sign of enjoying the process.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a disagreement between two groups within a big organization called Nipsa that has more than 45,000 members. The argument was about two people who joined Nipsa and were not allowed to be members. A special group called a tribunal looked into the problem and decided that those two people should not have been kicked out of the organization. The article says that Nipsa has had this kind of problem before, and the tribunal wishes the organization could find a better way to solve their problems without always needing their help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie was first released onto the Syfy channel on January 19, 2013 and centers around a group of friends that get attacked by extremely large tasmanian devils. \\"Radio Times\\" rated the film poorly, giving it two out of 5 stars. Can we draw the following conclusion? Tasmanian Devils is a film critic that is about a group of friends being attacked.","completion":"No, the conclusion you have drawn is incorrect. Let me clarify the information provided: 1. \\"Tasmanian Devils\\" is not a film critic; it is a television film that was released in 2013. A film critic is a person who writes reviews and critiques about movies. 2. The movie is about a group of friends who get attacked by extremely large Tasmanian devils, not that it is a critic about them being attacked. A more accurate conclusion would be: \\"Tasmanian Devils is a 2013 television film that centers around a group of friends being attacked by large Tasmanian devils.\\" To further elaborate, \\"Tasmanian Devils\\" is a television film that premiered on the Syfy channel on January 19, 2013. Directed by Zach Lipovsky, the movie features actors Danica McKellar and Apolo Ohno in significant roles. The plot of the film revolves around a group of friends who fall victim to attacks by oversized Tasmanian devils, turning their adventure into a fight for survival. Despite the thrilling concept, \\"Tasmanian Devils\\" received poor ratings from critics, such as Radio Times, which awarded the film a two out of five-star rating. The film may not have been well-received for various reasons, such as plot execution, character development, or visual effects, which could have contributed to the negative review. In conclusion, \\"Tasmanian Devils\\" is a television film about a group of friends being attacked by large Tasmanian devils and has garnered poor ratings from critics like Radio Times. It should not be confused with a film critic, as it is the movie itself rather than a person writing reviews about it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sentence 1: The Ojhas are spiritual guides, teachers and members of the highest ritual rank as brahmans in the varna system of Hinduism. Sentence 2: The Ojhas are ritual leaders, teachers and members of the highest spiritual rank in the varna system of Hinduism as brahmans. Step 1: Identify the key terms in both sentences. Sentence 1: Ojhas as spiritual guides, teachers, the highest ritual rank, brahmans, and varna system. Sentence 2: Ojhas as ritual leaders, teachers, the highest spiritual rank, brahmans, and varna system. Step 2: Examine the differences between the two sentences.

Article: Via POLITICO's Juana Summers, Mitt Romney's latest comments in the Jeremiah Wright back-and-forth: \\"I want to make it very clear, I repudiate that effort. I think it's the wrong course for a PAC or a campaign. I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the futures and about issues and about a vision for America,\\" Romney told reporters Thursday. \\"I've been disappointed in the president's campaign to date, which has been focused on character assassination. I just think that we're wiser to talk about the issues of the day, what we do to get America working again, talk about our respective records.\\" … Romney was also questioned about a February appearance on Sean Hannity's radio show in which he brought up Wright himself during the GOP primary, but said he was unfamiliar with the specific quote. \\"I'm actually — I'm not familiar with precisely, exactly what I said. But I stand by what I said, whatever it was. And with regards to — I'll go back and take a look at what was said there,\\" he said. ||||| The group suggested hiring as a spokesman an “extremely literate conservative African-American” who can argue that Mr. Obama misled the nation by presenting himself as what the proposal calls a “metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln .” A copy of a detailed advertising plan was obtained by The New York Times through a person not connected to the proposal who was alarmed by its tone. It is titled “The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good.” The proposal was presented last week in Chicago to associates and family members of Mr. Ricketts, who is also the patriarch of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs . Brian Baker, president and general counsel of a super PAC called the Ending Spending Action Fund, said Mr. Ricketts had studied several advertising proposals in recent months and had not signed off on a specific approach to taking on Mr. Obama. “Joe Ricketts is prepared to spend significant resources in the 2012 election in both the presidential race and Congressional races,” Mr. Baker said in an interview Wednesday. “He is very concerned about the future direction of the country and plans to take a stand.” The document makes clear that the effort is only in the planning stages and awaiting full approval from Mr. Ricketts. People involved in the planning said the publicity now certain to surround it could send the strategists back to the drawing board. But it serves as a rare, detailed look at the birth of the sort of political sneak attack that has traditionally been hatched in the shadows and has become a staple of presidential politics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It also shows how a single individual can create his own movement and spend unlimited sums to have major influence on a presidential election in a campaign finance environment in which groups operating independently of candidates are flourishing.

View all New York Times newsletters. Should the plan proceed, it would run counter to the strategy being employed by Mitt Romney ’s team, which has so far avoided such attacks. The Romney campaign has sought to focus attention on the economy, and has concluded that personal attacks on Mr. Obama, who is still well liked personally by most independent voters surveyed for polls, could backfire. Mr. Ricketts has become an increasingly active player in Republican politics through several political action committees, including Ending Spending. He has a son, Pete, who is a member of the Republican National Committee from Nebraska and a daughter, Laura, who is a top contributor to Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign. She has not been involved in her father’s political efforts. The 54-page proposal was professionally bound and illustrated with color photographs, indicating that it is far beyond a mere discussion. The strategists have already contacted Larry Elder, a black conservative radio host in Los Angeles , about serving as a spokesman, and the plan calls for a group of black business leaders to endorse the effort. The strategists have also registered a domain name, Character Matters. The proposal suggests that Mr. Ricketts believes the 2008 campaign of Senator John McCain erred in not using images of Mr. Wright against Mr. Obama, who has said that the pastor helped him find Jesus but that he was never present for Mr. Wright’s politically charged sermons. Mr. Obama left the church during the campaign. Apparently referring to a Wright ad that was produced for the McCain campaign by Mr. Davis’s firm but never used, the proposal opens with a quote from Mr. Ricketts: “If the nation had seen that ad, they’d never have elected Barack Obama.” The planning document is emblazoned with the logo of Strategic Perception, the political advertising firm of Mr. Davis, the colorful Republican operative who last worked on the Republican presidential campaign of former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman of Utah . Included on his “Recommended Team of Pirates ” are the former Huntsman pollster Whit Ayres and the McCain campaign Internet strategist Becki Donatelli. The document, which was written by former advisers to Mr. McCain, is critical of his decision in 2008 not to aggressively pursue Mr. Obama’s relationship with Mr. Wright. In the opening paragraphs of the proposal, the Republican strategists refer to Mr. McCain as “a crusty old politician who often seemed confused, burdened with a campaign just as confused.” “Our plan is to do exactly what John McCain would not let us do: Show the world how Barack Obama’s opinions of America and the world were formed,” the proposal says. “And why the influence of that misguided mentor and our president’s formative years among left-wing intellectuals has brought our country to its knees.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The plan is designed for maximum impact, far beyond a typical 10 million television advertising campaign. It calls for full-page newspaper advertisements featuring a comment Mr. Wright made the Sunday after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. “America’s chickens are coming home to roost,” he said. The plan is for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte , N.C., to be “jolted.” The advertising campaign would include television ads, outdoor advertisements and huge aerial banners flying over the convention site for four hours one afternoon. The strategists grappled with the quandary of running against Mr. Obama that other Republicans have cited this year: “How to inflame their questions on his character and competency, while allowing themselves to still somewhat ‘like’ the man becomes the challenge.” Lamenting that voters “still aren’t ready to hate this president,” the document concludes that the campaign should “explain how forces out of Obama’s control, that shaped the man, have made him completely the wrong choice as president in these days and times.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In the article, Mitt Romney responds to a proposal aiming to create a smear campaign against Barack Obama, emphasizing that he prefers to focus on issues and a vision for America. The proposal, which has not yet received full approval from Joe Ricketts, the billionaire behind it, outlines an advertising plan designed to discredit Obama by questioning his character and by using his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, as a focal point. Ricketts has received several proposals in recent months and has not dismissed the possibility of spending significant resources on presidential and congressional races. Although the proposal is still in its planning stages, it is bound and illustrated, showing a more developed intention. If implemented, this advertising campaign would go against the strategy being used by Romney's team, which has avoided personal attacks on Obama and opted to focus on the economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mandolin When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin. By the 1930s, single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music, most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys (Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers (Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe). However, the mandolin's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man: Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music. After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939, Bill Monroe formed his own group, after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys, and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a \\"parlor\\" sound typical of brother duets to the modern \\"bluegrass\\" style. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South, directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin. Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin, signed and dated July 9, 1923, by Lloyd Loar, chief acoustic engineer at Gibson. The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders.

None of the eukaryotic members of the family have yet been characterized.', 'Here, we characterize two MscS-like (MSL) proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, MSL2 and MSL3. MSL3 can rescue the osmotic-shock sensitivity of a bacterial mutant lacking MS-ion-channel activity, suggesting that it functions as a mechanosensitive ion channel. Arabidopsis plants harboring insertional mutations in both MSL3 and MSL2 show abnormalities in the size and shape of plastids, which are plant-specific endosymbiotic organelles responsible for photosynthesis, gravity perception, and numerous metabolic reactions. MSL2-GFP and MSL3-GFP are localized to discrete foci on the plastid envelope and colocalize with the plastid division protein AtMinE. Answer: Our data support a model wherein MSL2 and MSL3 control plastid size, shape, and perhaps division during normal plant development by altering ion flux in response to changes in membrane tension. We propose that MscS family members have evolved new roles in plants since the endosymbiotic event that gave rise to plastids.","completion":"Task: Construct a question based on the given passage.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Goal: What do I do once my egg whites are foamy when making pavlova cookies? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"Once your egg whites are foamy while making pavlova cookies, it is crucial to proceed with the appropriate method to create a perfect meringue mixture. There are multiple approaches to accomplish this, and I will compare two methods for you to decide which is more reasonable based on your preferences and convenience. Method 1: Gradually add sugar and beat the mixture. This method involves slowly incorporating sugar into the foamy egg whites while continuously beating the mixture. This method ensures that the sugar is properly dissolved, and the egg whites reach soft peaks before any other ingredient is added. 1. Gradually add sugar: Slowly start adding in your granulated sugar (caster sugar is preferred) into the foamy egg whites, while continuously beating the mixture at medium speed. Add the sugar in small increments (around a tablespoon at a time), making sure that each addition is fully incorporated before adding more. 2. Beat until stiff peaks: Continue beating the egg whites and sugar mixture until you reach stiff peaks. This is the point where, after lifting the beater, the peaks stand up straight and do not fall over. Be careful not to over-beat the mixture, as it could cause the meringue to crack or become grainy. 3. Add flavorings and stabilizing agents: Once you have reached stiff peaks, mix in any desired flavorings (such as vanilla extract) and stabilizing agents (cream of tartar or cornstarch) to maintain the meringue's structure. 4. Shape pavlova cookies: Using a piping bag or spoon, shape your pavlova cookies on a lined baking sheet. 5. Bake and cool: Bake your pavlova cookies at a low temperature (around 200°F/100°C) for an extended period (approximately 1.5-2 hours) to dry out the pavlova cookies without browning them. Once baked, turn off the oven and allow them to cool inside with the door slightly ajar. Method 2: Make a sugar syrup and beat it with the egg whites. This method involves making a hot sugar syrup and gradually pouring it into the foamy egg whites while beating the mixture. This process creates an Italian meringue, which is more stable than the traditional method and can yield smoother cooking results. 1. Prepare sugar syrup: In a small saucepan, combine water and sugar, and cook over medium heat until the sugar syrup reaches 248°F (120°C) on a candy thermometer. 2. Gradually add sugar syrup to egg whites: While beating the foamy egg whites at medium speed, carefully pour the hot sugar syrup in a slow and steady stream into the egg whites. Make sure not to pour the syrup over the beaters to avoid splatters. 3. Beat until stiff peaks: Continue beating the mixture until you reach stiff peaks and the meringue has cooled down to room temperature. 4. Add flavorings and stabilizing agents: Proceed to add any desired flavorings and stabilizing agents just like in method 1. 5. Shape pavlova cookies: Shape and bake the pavlova cookies following the same steps in method 1. Both methods produce pavlova cookies with decent results. However, the choice between the two methods depends on your preferences and experience. Method 1 is the more traditional approach, while method 2 lends itself to a more stable meringue with a smoother texture. If you are more experienced in the kitchen and have access to a candy thermometer, method 2 might be more reasonable for you. On the other hand, if you are a beginner or prefer a simpler process, method 1 might better suit your needs."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Marie-louise Olson. PUBLISHED:. 20:17 EST, 1 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 21:12 EST, 1 December 2013. In an observatory deep in an inhospitable area of the South Pole, a group of American scientists have been holed up for the last two years, waiting with baited breath for a little sign - something to show that they were not going loopy looking for a tiny little particle that no one has ever seen. That day has finally come and the researchers have announced they have reached a new frontier in studies of the universe - a discovery they are calling a ‘new age of astronomy’. The US-led 270m IceCube facility based on a cubic kilometre of Antarctic ice has detected very high-energy cosmic neutrinos - subatomic particles that reach Earth from deep space, possibly the remnants from exploding stars, called supernovae. Ordinary telescopes cannot see the elusive neutrinos, but IceCube's can. It is the largest neutrino telescope in the world. A new frontier: The IceCube detector, the world's largest neutrino observatory, has observed the first solid evidence for high-energy neutrinos that originate outside of our own solar system. Elusive: View of the subatomic neutrino tracks showing electrons and muons caught in a nano second. Ordinary telescopes cannot see the neutrinos. Unlike photons, aka light particles, they hardly ever interact with ordinary matter, because they carry no electric charge and very little mass. This makes them extremely hard to detect. The IceCube facility, however, can see neutrinos, which stream across the universe in unimaginable quantities, according to FT. What makes neutrinos so important to astronomers’ probes is that they travel in absolutely straight lines from their source without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. They escape more readily than photons from the core of a supernova, for example, or other such phenomena in the universe. Supernova: Neutrinos escape more readily than photons from the core of a supernova, such as the Tycho supernova, which exploded 400 years ago. Spectacular: A star in the constellation Taurus a thousand years ago is spewing out a blizzard of extremely high-energy particles, some of which could be the neutrinos that were discovered at the IceCube observatory. Neutrinos have already been detected in various forms. The first was 'seen' in 1956. However, scientists had not yet detected the pure form of neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic than those already detected. These are the ones produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions, also known as the supernova remnants. The IceCube was built in the South Pole to maximise the chance of observing these elusive cosmic neutrinos. Remnants: The neutrinos that were found are the ones produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions, also known as the supernova remnants. The IceCube was built in the South Pole to maximise the chance of observing these elusive cosmic neutrinos. Rearchers melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and 2,000m beneath the surface. Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Although trillions of neutrinos travel unscathed through the observatory every second, a precious few arrive at exactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice. This collision generates electrically charged particles which radiate light that is picked up by the detectors. Underground: The IceCube crew melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and 2,000m beneath the surface. Isolate: Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Computers then calculate the energy and incoming direction of the neutrino from the pattern and intensity of the light emitted. The IceCube team last week said in the journal Science they had detected 28 high-energy neutrinos coming from beyond the solar system over two years. Lower-energy neutrinos reach us in vast numbers from the sun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth’s upper atmosphere. These 28 neutrinos are too small a sample to derive any conclusions about what produced them, but whatever it is must generate staggeringly high energies. Reaction: Just a handful of the trillions of neutrinos that travel through the observatory every second arrive at exactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice. Lower-energy neutrinos reach the Earth in vast numbers from the sun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and the upper atmosphere, but high-energy particles are from further away. 'Gratifying': Prof. Francis Halzen, principal investigator of IceCube says the discovery is what they have been looking for. 'This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy,' he said. Two of the detected neutrinos had more energy than a fly in flight, packed into a single subatomic particle. Likely sources include supernovae and material being sucked into huge black holes. ‘It is gratifying to finally see what we have been looking for,’ says Francis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin and IceCube principal investigator. ‘This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy.’ The IceCube project is part of the University of Wisconsin–Madison projects developed and supervised by the same institution, while collaboration and funding is provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Neutrinos were first detected in 1956 by Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D. McGuire, who published confirmation that they had detected the neutrino in Science, a. result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the 1995 Nobel. Prize. The detection of solar neutrinos, and of neutrinos of the SN 1987A supernova in 1987 marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. The normal energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV. However, the sites where cosmic rays are accelerated are expected to produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic, produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions: the supernova remnants. This is the type of neutrino that scientists believe has been detected now for the first time. Neutrinos travel in absolutely straight lines from their source without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. This means they show exactly what is out there in its purest form.

Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter. Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class.

It is currently run by Neil Gershenfeld. This cross-disciplinary center broadly looks at the intersection of information to its physical representation. - Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832 November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator, who was the cofounder of Cornell University and served as its first president for nearly two decades. He was known for expanding the scope of college curriculae. A politician, he had served as state senator in New York. He was later appointed as a US diplomat to Germany and Russia, among other responsibilities. - Molecular nanotechnology (MNT) is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis. This is distinct from nanoscale materials. Based on Richard Feynman's vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products (including additional nanomachines), this advanced form of nanotechnology (or \\"molecular manufacturing\\") would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by molecular machine systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by biophysics, chemistry, other nanotechnologies, and the molecular machinery of life with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories. - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807 December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator. - Swarthmore College (locally, or ), is a highly selective, leading private liberal arts college located in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, southwest of Philadelphia. - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A quantum Turing machine (QTM), also a universal quantum computer, is an abstract machine used to model the effect of a quantum computer. It provides a very simple model which captures all of the power of quantum computation. Any quantum algorithm can be expressed formally as a particular quantum Turing machine. Such Turing machines were first proposed in a 1985 article written by Oxford University physicist David Deutsch suggesting quantum gates could function in a similar fashion to traditional digital computing binary logic gates. - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - David Elieser Deutsch, FRS (born 18 May 1953), is an Israeli-born British physicist at the University of Oxford. He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. - Ithaca is a city in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region of New York. It is the seat of Tompkins County, as well as the largest community in the Ithaca-Tompkins County metropolitan area. This area contains the municipalities of the Town of Ithaca, the village of Cayuga Heights, and other towns and villages in Tompkins County. The city of Ithaca is located on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake, in Central New York. It is named for the Greek island of Ithaca. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology devoted to projects at the convergence of technology, multimedia, sciences, art and design. Staff and students have backgrounds ranging from electrical engineering and computer science to sociology and music and others. The Media Lab has been widely popularized since the 1990s by business and technology publications such as \\"Wired\\" and \\"Red Herring\\" for a series of practical inventions in the fields of wireless networks, field sensing, web browsers and the World Wide Web. , it has diversified its research into neurobiology, biologically inspired fabrication, socially engaging robots, emotive computing, bionics, and hyperinstruments. The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was one of the notable research efforts which grew out of the Media Lab. - Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed, scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society. As also confirmed by various measurement standards, which include the \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" impact factor and the journal h-index proposed by Google Scholar, many physicists and other scientists consider \\"Physical Review Letters\\" one of the most prestigious journals in the field of physics. - The American Physical Society (APS) is the world's second largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious \\"Physical Review\\" and \\"Physical Review Letters\\", and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents.

In turn-of-the-century Oakland, California, the teenaged Myrtle McKinley is expected to follow high school by attending a San Francisco business college. Instead, she takes a job performing with a traveling vaudeville troupe, where she meets and falls in love with singer-dancer Frank Burt. Frank proposes they marry and also entertain on stage together as an act, which proves very popular. Myrtle retires from show business after giving birth to daughters Iris and Mikie, while her husband goes on tour with another partner. A few years later, less successful now, Frank persuades his wife to return to the stage. The girls are cared for by their grandmother as their parents leave town for months at a time. Iris and Mikie are school girls when they are given a trip to Boston to see their parents. Iris meets a well-to-do young man, Bob Clarkman, and is permitted to attend an exclusive boarding school there.

Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul announced his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said that each of them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing either of the two main parties' candidates (McCain - Republican Party, or Obama - Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the \\"charade\\" that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again. Two weeks later, \\"shocked and disappointed\\" that Bob Barr (the Libertarian nominee) had pulled out of attending the press conference at the last minute and had admonished Paul for remaining neutral and failing to say which specific candidate Paul would vote for in the general election, Paul released a statement saying that he had decided to endorse Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate, for president. Paul withdrew from active campaigning in the last weeks of the primary election period. He received 42,426 votes, or 0.03% of the total cast, in the general election.

In 2008, he didn't like the main people who were trying to become president from the big groups called the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. So, he showed that he supports other people who want to become president from smaller groups like the Green Party, Libertarian Party, Constitution Party, and people who work independently. He didn't want to support the main candidates because they wouldn't make the big changes that he thinks are needed. Instead, he encouraged people to vote for the other candidates to show that they also want changes in the way elections work. After some time, he chose to support Chuck Baldwin from the Constitution Party to be president. Ron Paul didn't actively campaign at the end of the election time and only got a very small amount of votes in the final count.

Despite having a mix of both fun and negative experiences in the described night, they mention meeting amazing people and reconnecting with individuals they hadn't seen since high school. These aspects highlight both the growing awareness of the need for change and appreciation for the connections made during that time. In terms of future partying, it seems like the author is ready to move on from the party scene. They might decide to focus on nurturing and maintaining relationships with the amazing people they met, maybe through smaller gatherings or other activities not centered around partying. They might also make an effort to keep in touch with the individuals they reconnected with and check up on their life progress. Additionally, the author may choose to evaluate their priorities and lifestyle choices in order to find healthier alternatives for entertainment and socializing. This could include exploring new interests and hobbies that would allow them to meet new people and form connections outside of the party environment. Furthermore, since the author acknowledges the sense of déjà vu and seeing people change or stay the same, they might reflect on their own personal growth and decide what kind of person they want to evolve into. By embracing this self-awareness, they can find activities and environments that align with their values and goals. In conclusion, although the author seems to have decided to leave the party lifestyle behind, the positive experiences and connections established during those times can serve as a foundation for building more meaningful relationships in the future. This transition may also include searching for healthier alternatives to socialize, discovering new interests, and reflecting on their personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Gift Horse, a skeletal sculpture which displays a live feed from the London Stock Exchange, has been unveiled in Trafalgar Square.\\"","completion":"Title: Gift Horse: Trafalgar Square's Equestrian Skeletal Sculpture with a Modern Twist Introduction The bustling Trafalgar Square in London has recently been graced with a unique addition - an equine artwork with an unconventional merger of mediums and a telling socio-political message. The intriguing masterpiece titled \\"Gift Horse,\\" a skeletal sculpture displaying a live feed from the London Stock Exchange, has been unveiled in one of the city’s most famous public spaces. This article presents an in-depth look at the intricate details and significant implications of this awe-inspiring piece to London’s cityscape and the art world at large. Gift Horse: The Artwork Gift Horse is a skeletal sculpture designed by the renowned German-born, London-based artist, Hans Haacke. The sculpture, fashioned onto the iconic fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, stands as a multifaceted artistic expression interweaving historical and contemporary themes. At first glance, the 16-foot bronze sculpture appears as the skeleton of a horse, but upon closer inspection, it projects an intriguing connection between its equestrian structure and contemporary financial data. One of the most outstanding features of Gift Horse is the electronic ribbon wrapped around the horse's front leg. This ribbon displays the constantly evolving stock market index from the London Stock Exchange, presenting a real-time commentary on the ever-changing fluctuations and perturbations of the global economic landscape. The Inspiration and Concept The skeletal structure of Gift Horse was inspired by a painting by George Stubbs, an 18th-century British painter known for his horse paintings. Specifically, it is drawn from the work \\"The Anatomy of the Horse,\\" which served as an influential study in the realm of equine anatomy. By referencing this historical artwork, Haacke pays homage to the cultural and artistic heritage of Britain. However, the live stock ticker seamlessly interwoven with the sculpture offers stark contrast and commentary on the financial and economic state of the world today. The artist’s concept delivers a fascinating look into how modern technology and capitalism have infiltrated every aspect of human existence, including the spheres of art and culture. Symbolism and Political Undertones The title ‘Gift Horse’ alludes to the colloquial phrase \\"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth,\\" which encourages individuals to accept gifts graciously and without question. In the context of the sculpture, Haacke urges viewers to challenge this conventional directive by prompting them to scrutinize the financial information streaming from the horse’s foreleg. The skeletal form of the horse can be perceived as a metaphor for the skeletal, or fragile, nature of the global economy. On the one hand, the London Stock Exchange is a symbol of the city's financial prowess and growth, while on the other, it represents a merciless, unpredictable world subject to constant change and uncertainty. Furthermore, Gift Horse is not just a piece of art, but a political commentary. In the heart of London, right in front of the National Gallery, the sculpture unapologetically highlights the widening economic disparities and the power wielded by global capitalism. This thought-provoking artwork serves as a striking reminder of the complicated web of power, money, and influence that governs modern society. Conclusion Gift Horse is a captivating masterpiece that showcases an innovative fusion of mediums, powerful symbolism, and a thought-provoking message. Hans Haacke’s daring equine skeletal sculpture stands tall in Trafalgar Square, offering visitors a fascinating glimpse into the intersection of art, technology, and finance. In a time when art is continuously evolving and striving for relevance, Gift Horse serves as a potent reminder that the world of aesthetics can still provoke introspection, spark conversations, and convey the essential truths about our society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their temperatures at the end of 5 minutes are different due to the difference in which property?","completion":"To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of water and vegetable oil that could cause a difference in temperature after being heated for the same amount of time. Step 1: Identify the properties that could affect heat absorption - Specific heat capacity - Thermal conductivity Step 2: Evaluate the significance of each property - Specific heat capacity: It is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1°C. If the substances have different specific heat capacities, they will absorb heat differently and end up with different temperatures after the same amount of heating. - Thermal conductivity: It is the ability of a substance to transfer heat through itself. While it plays a role in heating substances, in this case, we are considering identical containers for both substances, making it less likely to be the main factor for the difference in temperature. Step 3: Determine which property causes the difference in temperature Based on the evaluation above, it's more likely that the difference in the specific heat capacity of water and vegetable oil is the primary cause of the differing temperatures after being heated for 5 minutes.

Jessica sprayed the wall with paint. pick from the following. (1). unacceptable; (2). acceptable;","completion":"(2). Acceptable The sentence \\"Jessica sprayed the wall with paint\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break down the sentence structure and meaning to better understand why this is the case. Syntactically, the sentence follows the typical English sentence structure: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). 1. Subject: \\"Jessica\\" is the subject of the sentence, which refers to the person taking the action. 2. Verb: \\"sprayed\\" is the verb in the sentence, which describes the action being performed. 3. Object: \\"the wall\\" is the direct object, which tells what Jessica acted upon. 4. Prepositional phrase: \\"with paint\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides extra information about the action, such as the method or instrument used. There is no syntactic issue with this sentence as it maintains the proper sequence required for an English sentence: the subject performing the action, followed by the verb describing the action, and the direct object receiving the action (along with the prepositional phrase). Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable because it clearly conveys a comprehensible meaning, which is that Jessica used paint to coat or cover the wall. The subject, verb, and object form a logical and coherent set of relationships, while the prepositional phrase provides supplementary information enhancing the understanding of the action. In conclusion, the sentence is entirely coherent and adheres to standard English sentence structure and meaning, making it both syntactically and semantically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have... Guess a valid title for it! A:","completion":"\\"Adaptations and Functioning of the Whale Ear and Eye in the Marine Environment\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Amy bought a brand new car last weekend while Kayla didn't, because Select from: [+] Amy is very poor.; [+] Kayla is very poor.;","completion":"Kayla is very poor. Amy couldn't contain her excitement. She had finally been able to save up enough money to buy the brand new car she'd been dreaming of since she saw it showcased at the Auto Expo last year. The sleek design, cutting-edge technology, and the efficiency the car offered were all features Amy knew she needed in her life. Most importantly, she'd been able to afford it comfortably, making the purchase feel even better. On the other hand, there was Kayla. Much like Amy, she, too, had set her eyes on a beautiful car that, upon seeing it, had captured her heart and fuelled her desires. However, life had thrown its fair share of challenges her way. Kayla struggled to make ends meet and led a very frugal life. In spite of cutting back on her expenses and attempting to save money, she just couldn't put enough together to buy the car she wanted. Her dreams seemed unattainable, at least for the time being. Despite being aware of Kayla's financial struggles, Amy couldn't help but invite her for a drive in her new car. Excitement overshadowed her practical thinking, and Kayla, not wanting to dampen Amy's spirits, agreed to go for a spin. During the drive, Amy was ecstatic to see the pure joy and excitement on Kayla's face as she became enraptured by the car's performance and comfort. In that brief moment, they both shared a sense of carefree bliss, feeling the wind on their faces as they cruised along the coastline. After the drive, as the two friends sat on the hood of Amy's car overlooking the ocean, their laughter began to fade, and the reality of their differing situations began to settle in. Kayla felt a wave of envy so sudden and intense that she wasn't sure what to do with herself. Amy, witnessing her friend's sudden change in disposition, immediately sensed Kayla's discomfort and a knot formed in her stomach. \\"I'm really sorry, Kayla,\\" Amy said, her voice suddenly somber. \\"I didn't think about how flaunting my new car might affect you. I just got caught up in the excitement of it all.\\" Kayla looked at her friend and forced a smile. \\"No, Amy, it's okay. I'm happy for you. I really am. It's just…I guess I wish things were different for me, you know?\\" Amy nodded empathetically. \\"I understand, and I wish there was something I could do to help. But remember that life has its ups and downs, and this is just a phase for you. Good times will come. I'm sure of it.\\" As they sat there, Amy tried to think of ways she could help Kayla without making her feel like she was receiving charity. She knew that Kayla was hardworking, responsible, and had a great work ethic. It was all just a matter of finding the right opportunity. That's when it struck her. \\"I have an idea,\\" Amy said excitedly. \\"My company is hiring, and I think you'd be perfect for the position. Plus, it pays really well. Why don't you apply for it? With a better-paying job, it wouldn't be long before you could save up and get your dream car.\\" Kayla considered Amy's suggestion and felt a flicker of hope. \\"You really think I'd be a good fit?\\" she asked cautiously. \\"Absolutely!\\" Amy insisted. \\"You have all the skills they're looking for, and I'd be more than happy to refer you.\\" Feeling grateful for Amy's help, Kayla decided to take her friend's advice and apply for the job. She knew deep down that life might be hard at present, but with a little determination and support from her friends, her situation could change for the better. As they continued to sit and talk about their dreams and aspirations, Amy and Kayla committed to helping each other face the uncertainties life had in store for them.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: biological species perching in the garden at beach","completion":"In the given sentence, \\"biological species perching in the garden at beach\\", the most important words can be determined based on their significance in conveying the overall meaning of the sentence. Here are the most important words along with explanations for their importance: 1. Biological species: This term holds a primary significance in the sentence, as it is the subject being discussed. It tells us that the sentence is about living organisms that belong to a particular species. Any context or action in the sentence revolves around these organisms. 2. Perching: This verb describes the action of the biological species, which gives us essential information about what the organisms are doing. It helps create a clear image of their state or situation, which aids significantly in understanding the sentence. Without this action, we would only have information about the organisms' existence but not their behavior. 3. Garden: This word provides the crucial context of location. By telling us where the biological species are perching, the sentence becomes more meaningful. Garden typically implies a specific environment, which can influence the interpretation of the sentence and conjure images of nature, growth, and perhaps a serene or peaceful ambiance. 4. Beach: \\"Beach\\" is another word that provides context about the location, as it clarifies where the garden is found. This additional context further enriches our understanding of the sentence and helps create a mental image of the scenery. Knowing that the garden is by the beach may imply a particular kind of climate, geography, and ecosystem. This information might also be relevant for the kind of biological species that can be found in such an environment. These four words, in combination, convey crucial information about the subject, action, and location of the sentence, and are thus deemed the most important in understanding its meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New Zealand #39;s dollar rose and bonds fell after the central bank raised the nation #39;s benchmark interest rate for a fifth time and signaled it may boost rates again to curb inflation. OPTIONS: [A]. World; [B]. Sports; [C]. Business; [D]. Science/Tech;","completion":"[C]. Business This news is about New Zealand's economy and financial markets, which fall under the category of business. The central bank has raised the benchmark interest rate for the fifth time, which will have an effect on the nation's economic landscape and financial markets. Interest rates have a direct impact on inflation, borrowing, and spending in an economy. In this case, the central bank signals that it may increase rates again in the future to control inflation. Raising the interest rate is a common method employed by central banks to keep inflation under control. Inflation refers to the overall increase in general price levels over time. Controlling inflation is crucial to maintain stability in an economy and protect the purchasing power of a nation's currency. In the given news, the rise of the New Zealand dollar and the decrease in bond prices are both consequences of the central bank's decision to raise the benchmark interest rate. When interest rates rise, currency values often strengthen, since higher interest rates typically attract more foreign capital due to the prospect of higher returns on investments. On the other hand, bond prices typically fall as interest rates increase. This is because investors demand higher yields to compensate for the increased interest rate risk. As bond yields rise to meet investor expectations, the bond prices decrease, reflecting the inverse relationship between bond yields and prices. The central bank's decision to raise interest rates and the subsequent effects on the country's currency and bond markets are all tied to business and economic activities. Such information is essential for businesses and investors as they make decisions, and it is a clear representation of how macroeconomic policies can shape the financial landscape in a given country. Additionally, this news provides insight into the central bank's stance on monetary policy, which plays an important role in the overall functioning of the economy. Understanding the central bank's policy actions aids in anticipating future economic conditions and can help businesses and individuals make more informed decisions in areas such as investments, savings, and borrowing. Overall, the news about New Zealand's central bank increasing the benchmark interest rate, the implications on the nation's economy, and the potential for further rate hikes fall under the business category, as it deals with financial market dynamics and economic activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"More pollution will most likely not affect the frequency of bacterial entry into the body in any significant way. There's no direct link between the two variables. Explanation: Here, the user is asking me to analyze how an increase in pollution would affect the amount of bacteria entering the body.

The occurrence of pollution primarily affects air quality and, to some extent, might impact the types of bacteria or the volume of bacteria in the environment. However, these changes don't necessarily translate into more or fewer bacteria entering the body because the human body has multiple mechanisms (like skin, cilia in the respiratory system, etc.) to prevent bacterial entry regardless of the environment. Thus, based on the steps and factors involved, an increase in pollution would likely have no direct effect on the frequency or volume of bacteria entering the body and subsequently hitting the bloodstream. However, it's necessary to mention that increased pollution can have indirect health effects that could potentially weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to bacterial infections, but as per the specific context given (direct bacterial entry in the body), the effect would be minor or none."},{"prompt":"Read the bio below and try to give details on jim swinden 's: - death place - clubs - caps - position - years - height - death date - youthclubs - youthyears - birth date - fullname - name - birth place - goals Bio: james frederick \`\` jim '' swinden -lrb- 30 january 1905 -- march 1971 -rrb- was an english professional footballer who played as an inside-forward for southampton in the 1920s .

Given the question: Background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Paragraph: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","completion":"tetA. Step 1: Understand the background information provided about Aristotle's theory. According to Aristotle's theory, there are correlations between body mass, gestation period, and lifespan in live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals). These correlations are: - Brood size decreases with body mass. - Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. - Fecundity decreases with lifespan. Step 2: Apply the data from the paragraph to Aristotle's theory. In the given paragraph, John chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB, with the following characteristics: - An adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB (higher body mass). - A tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Step 3: Determine which tetrapod would live longer based on the given data and Aristotle's theory. According to Aristotle's theory, lifespan increases with both gestation period and body mass. Given that tetA has a higher body mass and a longer gestation period compared to tetB, we can infer that tetA would have a longer lifespan than tetB. Therefore, tetA would live longer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Maria could not figure it out.; (B). Sarah could not figure it out.;","completion":"Maria asked Sarah if they knew how to set up a smartphone because Maria could not figure it out (A). In this situation, Maria is experiencing difficulties with setting up her new smartphone. It's quite common for people, especially those who have recently purchased a new or upgraded device, to face challenges with its configuration. Setting up a smartphone typically involves several steps. First, the user needs to insert the SIM card, power on the device, and establish an initial connection with the carrier network. This will allow the phone to be activated and for calls, texts, and data services to function properly. Next, the user will need to connect the device to a Wi-Fi network or use mobile data to download and install any software updates that may be available. Moreover, setting up a smartphone also entails creating or signing in to a user account. This account is usually linked to an email address or a phone number and allows the user to access the device manufacturer's apps, cloud storage, and services. For example, Android users often sign in with their Google accounts, while Apple users use Apple IDs. To personalize the device, users must customize the settings, selecting preferences that suit their needs and preferences. They may choose their preferred language, set the time and date, and adjust system preferences such as brightness, notification settings, and volume levels. Additionally, users can configure their device's security measures by creating a password, generating a passcode, or using biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint recognition or facial scanning. Maria, having faced trouble with these tasks, turns to Sarah for help. Fortunately, Sarah is an individual well-versed in setting up smartphones and has extensive knowledge of the device setup processes. These include transferring contacts, messages, photos, and other data from the old device to the new one, as well as installing and organizing useful apps. Maria's difficulties might have arisen from various factors, such as a lack of familiarity with the new device's operating system, not understanding certain settings or features, or simply feeling overwhelmed by the multitude of customizable options. It's important to remember that seeking assistance with technology doesn't signify a lack of capacity or intelligence – sometimes people simply have different areas of expertise. By asking for Sarah's help, Maria can learn how to set up her smartphone correctly, and in return, perhaps share her own knowledge with Sarah in a different domain. This exchange of knowledge can strengthen their relationship, foster collaborative problem-solving, and create a more supportive community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The answer to the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? is inside the article: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Viking metal and pagan metal are two genres that are chiefly defined by their lyrical focus. These two styles place a strong emphasis on thematic material and imagery, often drawing on Viking and pagan themes. Rather than being characterized by specific musical qualities, they can incorporate musical elements from a broad range of other genres, making them more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a particular sound. These genres often incorporate anthem-like choruses and may use traditional instruments and ethnic melodies, but the classification is primarily based on the lyrical content and overall thematic focus. Therefore, Viking metal is not simply a subgenre of black metal or a version of medieval music, but employs Viking themes in elements like band names, album titles, artwork of album covers, and especially in the song lyrics. It's more about the expression of a culturally specific thematic material than musical categorization, hence leading to controversial categorizations in music genres."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it was in 1700 when he founded the Mission San Xavier del Bac, which is approximately 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the site of his initial visit. The Mission was established to evangelize and provide assistance to the native populations in the region, particularly the Tohono O'odham people, who have lived in the Sonoran Desert for thousands of years. The mission is named in honor of the Christian missionary and co-founder of the Society of Jesus, St. Francis Xavier. It is situated along the banks of the Santa Cruz River, approximately 10 miles south of present-day Tucson, Arizona. The location for the Mission was carefully chosen by Kino, as the area had fertile soil and a reliable water source, which were essential for agriculture and the mission's sustainability. Over the years, the Mission has gone through several changes and phases of construction. The first church building constructed at the site was a simple adobe structure. It was later replaced with a larger church that was designed and constructed by Ignacio Gaona, a prominent architect and builder of the time. The church, which now stands as the iconic Spanish Baroque structure known today as the White Dove of the Desert, was completed in the late 18th century. Throughout its long history, the Mission has faced numerous challenges, including abandonment, repairs, restorations, and even a temporary closure during the Mexican Jesuit Expulsion in the mid-18th century. Despite these challenges, Mission San Xavier del Bac still stands today as an important historical, cultural, and spiritual landmark. In conclusion, Mission San Xavier del Bac was founded by Jesuit missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino in 1700, after he initially visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692. The mission holds great historical, cultural, and spiritual significance, serving as an iconic landmark in the southwest United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is due to an increase in nuclear charge. Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest. Because most noble gases do not form compounds, they do not have electronegativities. Note that there is little variation among the transition metals. Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size. Answer:","completion":"Section A"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: CHICAGO (AP) — Best-selling author Kevin Trudeau, whose name became synonymous with late-night TV pitches, was sentenced to 10 years in prison Monday for bilking consumers through ubiquitous infomercials for his book, \\"The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About.\\" FILE - In this Oct. 28, 2013 file photo, television infomercial pitchman Kevin Trudeau speaks to the media after leaving the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago. On Monday, March 17,... (Associated Press) As he imposed the sentence prosecutors had requested, U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman portrayed the 50-year-old Trudeau as a habitual fraudster going back to his early adulthood. So brazen was Trudeau, the judge said, he once even used his own mother's Social Security number in a scheme. \\"Since his 20s, he has steadfastly attempted to cheat others for his own gain,\\" Guzman said, adding that Trudeau is \\"deceitful to the very core.\\" Trudeau, whose trademark dyed black hair turned partially gray as he awaited sentencing in jail, showed little emotion as the stiff sentence was handed down at the hearing in Chicago. Addressing the judge earlier in a 10-minute statement, Trudeau apologized and said he's become a changed man. He said he's meditated, prayed and read self-help books while locked up at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center. \\"I have truly had a significant reawakening,\\" said Trudeau, who was dressed in orange jail clothes. \\"If I ever do an infomercial again ... I promise: No embellishments, no puffery, no lies.\\" While Trudeau appeared calm throughout the hearing, one of his supporters interrupted the judge at one point and began to speak. After cutting the judge short a second time, the man dropped to the floor and refused to leave. U.S. marshals carried him out of the courtroom. Jurors convicted Trudeau of criminal contempt in November for defying a 2004 court order barring him from running false ads about the weight-loss book. Despite the order, he aired the infomercials at least 32,000 times, according to prosecutors. He sold more than 850,000 copies of the weight-loss book, generating 39 million in revenue, prosecutors say. And the judge agreed with prosecutors that the amount of loss stemming from Trudeau's deception was more than 37 million — nearly the amount in revenue. But in remarks Monday asking for a sentence of less than two years for his client, defense attorney Tom Kirsch said the harm Trudeau caused was minor compared to fraud in which some people are cheated out of their life savings. \\"A 10-year sentence might be appropriate for a defendant who destroyed lives,\\" Kirsch said. \\"(But) Trudeau — if he swindled anyone — swindled them out of 30 (the price of the book).\\" Another defense attorney, Carolyn Gurland, added that Trudeau's legal troubles had already cost him his businesses and his home, and nearly all his other worldly possessions. \\"He has a suitcase containing his personal artifacts. That's what he has left,\\" she said. But Guzman showed little sympathy, appearing angry as he said that Trudeau had thumbed his nose at the justice system by violating multiple court orders since the 1990s. \\"He has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions ... or impediments to be side-stepped, out-maneuvered or just ignored,\\" the judge said. Trudeau's weight-loss book describes a grueling, 500-calorie-a-day diet, as well as hormone treatments. The deception, Guzman explained, came in Trudeau's infomercials that misrepresented the contents of the book as laying out \\"a simple, no hunger ... diet-free method of losing weight,\\" which enticed more people to buy the book. Trudeau became rich selling millions of books with titles such as \\"Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About\\" and \\"Debt Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About,\\" touting them in commercials with a news-interview formats. As legal scrutiny intensified over the years, Trudeau claimed the U.S. government was out to get him, and he accused agencies and other vested interests of conspiring to suppress low-cost, common remedies to diseases, including cancer. His weight-loss book, which once topped best-seller lists, was the focus of the criminal conviction for which he was sentenced. It also was the subject of related civil case brought by the Federal Trade Commission, in which Trudeau was ordered to pay a 37 million judgment. In that civil case, Trudeau said he couldn't pay the judgment because he's broke. But FTC lawyers balked at that claim, accusing him of hiding money in shell companies. Trudeau, they noted, has spent lavishly in recent years, including 359 on two haircuts. ___ Follow Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm . ||||| Kevin Trudeau has his day in court When TV huckster Kevin Trudeau stood in a packed federal courtroom to make one final sales pitch Monday, he hardly resembled the tanned, dapper figure seen hawking miracle diets and natural cancer cures on so many late-night infomercials. After spending four months in jail for contempt of court, Trudeau’s trademark jet black coif was thin and gray. His usual tailored suit was replaced by rumpled orange jail clothes. Even his typical air of defiance had turned to contrition, a change he said washed over him during his sleepless first night in custody. “If I ever write a book again, if I ever do another infomercial again, I promise no embellishment, no puffery and absolutely no lies,” Trudeau told U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman in a remorseful tone. “I know going forward I will be a better person.” But the judge wasn’t buying a word. Moments after Trudeau’s plea for leniency, a visibly irritated Guzman sentenced the best-selling author to 10 years in prison, citing Trudeau’s decades-long history of fraud and calling him “deceitful to the core.” “He has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions...or at most impediments to be sidestepped, outmaneuvered or just ignored,” Guzman said in handing down an unusually lengthy prison term for a contempt conviction. “That type of conduct simply cannot stand.” At the defense table, Trudeau sat back in his chair and smiled slightly as the judge announced his decision. Before he was escorted back to the lockup by U.S. deputy marshals, he turned and waved at the dozens of supporters who had packed the courtroom gallery, mouthing the words, “Thank you.” It was a tranquil end to a two-hour hearing that at one point had grown raucous. As Guzman was questioning one of Trudeau’s attorneys, an elderly supporter suddenly stood in the front row of the audience and bellowed, “Judge, I am a former U.S. congressman!” before being ordered to sit down. After another outburst a few minutes later, the man, later identified as Ed Foreman, 80, of Dallas, was ordered to leave the courtroom. He refused, and when security officers tried to stand Foreman up, he went limp and was eventually carried out as other spectators shouted in protest. “You are not entitled to disrupt the proceedings,” Guzman told the remaining audience members, some of whom sobbed loudly. “I urge you to simply keep quiet and listen.” Foreman, a former Congressman who represented districts in Texas and New Mexico four decades ago, was ticketed for creating a disturbance, a petty offense payable by a 150 fine and court fees, officials said. According to his website, he is a motivational speaker who has previously touted Trudeau’s Global Information Network, touted as an international club that charges membership fees in exchange for success “secrets.” Trudeau has been jailed since Nov. 12 when he was convicted by a federal jury of criminal contempt for lying in several infomercials about the contents of his hit book, “The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About.” Prosecutors said he ignored a previous court order by describing the program as easy when it actually called for punishing calorie restrictions and a crippling list of food restrictions. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman has repeatedly found Trudeau in civil contempt for failing to pay anything toward a 37.6 million fine imposed by the Federal Trade Commission in spite of continuing to live a lavish lifestyle. On Monday, prosecutors cited Trudeau’s history of fraud that goes back to a state conviction in 1984. “He is a habitual liar and a fraudster,” Assistant U.S. Attorney April Perry said. As a result of the size of the fraud and Trudeau’s two previous felony convictions, federal sentencing guidelines called for 20 to 25 years in prison, a range that Guzman said he thought was “appropriate.” However, he eventually agreed with prosecutors who said a 10-year term was sufficient since -- unlike in many fraud cases -- no one who bought Trudeau’s book was financially ruined. Trudeau’s attorneys argued that prosecutors vastly inflated the amount of harm done by Trudeau’s misleading infomercials, saying many buyers were satisfied with the weight loss book. In his lengthy statement to the court, Trudeau said he has been “completely wiped out” financially and that he and his wife Nataliya Babenko, 26, are “effectively homeless.” He said his time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center has changed his perspective and led him to realize he had made many errors. While he wouldn’t wish incarceration on anyone, the experience has wound up being “one of the best, most positive things in my life,” Trudeau said. “In the past four months I have been stripped of all ego, defiance, arrogance and pride and for that I am thankful,” Trudeau said as he stooed at a lectern and read from typed notes. But Judge Guzman was unimpressed, noting that in his three decades of fraud, Trudeau had taken on more than a dozen different aliases and even used his mother’s Social Security number to perpetrate a scam. “That doesn’t happen by accident, and it doesn’t happen by good intentions,” the judge said. “It is a reflection of a person’s character.” jmeisner@tribune.com |||||Summary:","completion":"Best-selling author Kevin Trudeau, known for his late-night TV infomercials, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for defrauding consumers with his weight-loss book, \\"The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About.\\" A U.S. District Judge, Ronald Guzman, portrayed Trudeau as a consistent fraudster, even mentioning a case where the author used his own mother's Social Security number in a scheme. According to the judge, Trudeau's fraudulent behaviors can be traced back to his early adulthood. Trudeau showed little emotion during the sentencing. Prior to the stiff sentence being imposed, he apologized and stated that he'd become a different person while in jail. He claimed to have engaged in meditation, prayer and reading self-help books while incarcerated at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center. Trudeau's contempt conviction followed his defiance of a 2004 court order prohibiting him from running false ads about his weight-loss book. Despite the order, he aired the infomercials over 32,000 times. For this reason, he was convicted by the jury. According to the prosecutors, he managed to sell over 850,000 copies of the fraudulent weight-loss book, generating a revenue of 39 million. His defense lawyers argued that the harm Trudeau had caused was minor compared to more severe fraud cases where individuals lose their life savings. They stated that Trudeau's punishment was overly harsh given the level of deceit. They additionally highlighted that his legal troubles had already cost him his businesses, home, and nearly all other possessions, leaving him with only a suitcase of personal artifacts. Nevertheless, Judge Guzman showed little sympathy, noting that Trudeau had repeatedly violated court orders since the 1990s, treating them as mere suggestions rather than mandatory instructions. Trudeau's weight-loss book advertised a rigorous 500-calorie-a-day diet alongside hormone treatments. However, his infomercials misleadingly depicted the book as a simple, hunger-free, and diet-free method for weight loss, enticing people to purchase it. As his legal issues grew over the years, Trudeau declared that the U.S. government was against him. He asserted that agencies and other vested interests conspired to suppress simple, inexpensive remedies for diseases, including cancer. However, his weight-loss book was the focal point of both his criminal conviction and a related civil case led by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In the civil case, Trudeau was instructed to pay a 37 million judgement. When Trudeau claimed he could not pay the judgement as he was insolvent, lawyers from the FTC contested, accusing him of hiding money in shell companies. They pointed out Trudeau's lavish spending habits in recent years as contradictory to his claim of being broke. In conclusion, Kevin Trudeau's fraudulent actions and deceit, particularly related to his weight-loss book, resulted in a ten-year prison sentence, demonstrating a severe consequence for fraudulent activities and ignoring court orders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They ate all that they could find, and then moved on. Then around 10,000 years ago, about 1% of human history, people learned to farm the land. The kind of food we eat depends on which part of the world we live in, or which part of our country we live in. For example, in the south of China they eat rice, but in the north they eat noodles. In European countries near the sea, people eat a lot of fish. In central Europe, away from the sea, people don't eat so much fish, but they eat more meat. For example, in Germany and Poland, there are hundreds of different kinds of sausages. In North America, Australia, and Europe, people eat with knives and forks. In China, people eat with chopsticks. In parts of India and the Middle East, people use their fingers to pick up food. Nowadays it is possible to transport food easily from one part of the world to another. We can eat whatever we like, at any time of the year. In Britain, bananas come from Africa; rice comes from India or the U.S.A.; strawberries come from Chile or Spain. Food is a very big business.

Maggie and Grace spend Rick's and Fred's Hall Pass Week at Maggie's parents' house in Cape Cod, where Grace flirts with athlete Gerry (Tyler Hoechlin), saying that if their husbands have hall passes, so should they.With their wives and children away, Fred and Rick check into a motel and prepare for their Hall Pass Week. On Day One, they decide to eat before going to a local bar and get too tired to spend the night there, preferring to stay at the hotel.On Day Two, they eat pot brownies and decide to play golf, but get too high and wreak havoc on the golf course.On Day Three, they go to Hooters with their friends, but fail to impress the women there. They decide to get drunk in order to loosen up, but go too far and wind up getting into a fight with other customers. They spend Day Four at the hotel, suffering from a hangover.On Day Five, Rick goes to a local coffee shop, where he flirts with an attractive waitress called Leigh (Nicky Whelan), much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent, who insults Rick. When Rick answers him back, Leigh is impressed and tells Rick that they might see each other at the local gym they both attend. They later meet there, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick decides to go to a sauna instead, but falls asleep and stays there too long, getting burned and being forced to accept the help of two naked men to leave, much to his dismay.

First question: Computer Architecture: Why is context switching expensive on intel x86 chips? Second question: Why did the x86 architecture become more popular than the MIPS architecture? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: -- no. -- yes.","completion":"First answer: Context switching is a process where a computer saves the current state of a task so it can work on another task, and then later switch back to the first task. On Intel x86 chips, context switching is expensive because there are many registers and complex structures that need to be saved. This takes time and resources, which can slow down the computer. Second answer: The x86 architecture became more popular than the MIPS architecture because: 1. x86 was used in many personal computers (like those from IBM and Microsoft) which made it widely adopted. This means many people began using x86 computers since they were more available. 2. Many software applications were written for x86, so it was easier for people to find and use programs they wanted on x86 computers. 3. x86 was backward-compatible, so newer x86 chips could run older software written for previous versions. This made upgrading to newer computers easier for people. These two questions are not asking the same thing, so the answer is: -- no."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. U.S. policy on drug trafficking is not consistent with the need to put an end and actively repress the consumption of drugs.

No Imagine that there is a big bad group of people, let's call them \\"the drug mafia\\", who use a special plant called \\"coca\\" to make something that's not good for people. The person who wrote this thinks that instead of just getting rid of that special plant, we should really try to stop the bad people instead. They believe that the drug mafia has made a lot of money and caused many problems, even outside of Colombia where they come from. The conclusion you asked about says the opposite of what the person really meant. It says we should focus on getting rid of the special plant and not on stopping the bad people, and that they haven't made a lot of money or problems.
