Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Some people are more prone to folic acid deficiency than others because of genetic causes, intestinal issues, chronic illness, and the use of certain medications. Talk to your physician if you have risk factors that may prevent you from absorbing enough folic acid. Genetic mutations such as polymorphism (a genetic variance or flaw) can be a risk factor for folic acid deficiency. Known as a MTHFR mutation, your body may have trouble making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase which is critical for the body’s processing of folic acid. Chronic illnesses that affect absorption in the gastrointestinal tract may also cause folic acid deficiencies. If you suffer from Crohn’s or celiac disease, or are on dialysis, discuss strategies with your doctor to ensure you are ingesting enough folic acid. A number of common medications may interfere with folic acid absorption, including anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and antacids. If you are being treated for a particular condition, do not take folic acid supplements without first discussing it with your physician. Anemia is a tell-tale sign of a folate deficiency, so knowing the symptoms can help you identify if you’re having trouble absorbing folic acid. Symptoms of anemia include weakness, lack of concentration, and lightheadedness. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, numbness of the hands and feet, muscle weakness, and depression. Both vitamin b12 and folic acid deficiencies can cause anemia. Taking folic acid supplements alone can mask anemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, and vice versa. To make sure you’re getting enough of both, take vitamin B12 and folic acid together. Vitamin B12 and folic acid work synergistically to support heart and nerve health. Taking a folic acid supplement just before you eat a meal will ensure that your body digests it along with your food. Make it a habit to take your supplement before you eat so you’re getting your daily recommended amount of folic acid. Stick to a schedule. Because daily intake is important for folic acid, take it at a convenient time when you will remember. If you have trouble, set an alarm on your phone or computer. Alcohol can affect your body’s ability to absorb folic acid so avoid drinking more than 2-3 alcoholic drinks a day. Try to minimize your use of alcohol or stop drinking completely, especially if you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant, to increase your folic acid absorption. Alcohol can also cause you to excrete folic acid in your urine, lowering the level in your body. If you’re struggling to quit drinking, try getting help from a counselor or a program such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Alcoholics with folate deficiency are more at risk to develop liver injuries. Folic acid is destroyed by air and heat and the amount present in the foods can decrease significantly if food is improperly stored, overcooked, or reheated. Steaming is an excellent method for cooking vegetables since it preserves vitamins, including folate, better than boiling Orange juice or a vitamin C supplement can aid in the body's absorption of nutrients including folic acid. Vitamin C also plays an essential role in the way your body metabolizes folic acid, so add a tasty glass of orange juice or take a supplement at least once a day to boost your folic acid absorption.","completion":"This article says that some people might not get enough folic acid, which is a special vitamin our body needs. There could be different reasons why someone doesn't get enough. Our genes can sometimes cause this, as well as some long-lasting diseases, medication, or other things that our body goes through. If you feel weak, can't focus or feel lightheaded, it could be a sign that you don't have enough folic acid in your body. To fix it, you should talk to your doctor, always remember to take your folic acid and Vitamin B12 together, and make a routine out of it. It's better if you don't drink too much alcohol or cook your food in a way that destroys folic acid. Drinking orange juice or taking vitamin C can help your body use folic acid better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including collectivization and five-year plans for the national economy, led to famine and political repression. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the Peace of Riga two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes West Belarus. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in Białystok. Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The Brest Fortress, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it remained in Nazi hands until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more living space in the East for Germans.Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never..., what would be the answer ?

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Let's break down the two sentences and analyze the meanings and relationships between the words \\"mook,\\" \\"gavone,\\" and \\"schmuck.\\" Sentence 1: - \\"A mook is kind of like a gavone\\" implies that a mook shares similarities with a gavone. It doesn't necessarily mean they are identical, but there is a degree of likeness between the two. - \\"A gavone is kind of like an Italian schmuck\\" also implies that a gavone shares similarities with an Italian schmuck. Again, it doesn't mean they are identical, but there is a degree of likeness between the two. Based on these statements, we can infer that there is a chain of similarity between a mook, a gavone, and an Italian schmuck. It's important to note that the phrase \\"kind of like\\" implies that the similarity isn't absolute, but rather partial or in some aspects. Therefore, it is plausible that mook and gavone share certain characteristics that can be compared. Now let's consider Sentence 2: - \\"A gavone is nothing like a mook\\" is claiming that a gavone has no similarities to a mook. This statement directly contradicts Sentence 1, which established some degree of likeness between a mook and a gavone. If we were to consider the first sentence true, then the second sentence cannot be true because it contradicts the established relationship between a mook and a gavone. It is important to clarify that the first sentence only suggests that a mook and a gavone share some similarities, but doesn't guarantee they are entirely alike. However, the second sentence's claim that they have no similarities cannot be true given the premise established in Sentence 1. Therefore, if we abide by the assumption that Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is false."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plans for a public listing of the world’s biggest aluminum producer were derailed more than once over the past few years. But United Company Rusal’s persistence looks set to pay off when the company closes the order book of its Hong Kong IPO late on Thursday. Potential investors in the new listing are being guided to HK10.80 to HK12.00 (1.38 to 1.54) a share, which is above the midpoint of the IPO’s indicative range of HK9.10 to HK12.50 (1.17 to 1.60). Rusal’s 2.6 billion listing was fully subscribed within the first week it began taking orders on Jan. 21. The Moscow-based company’s shares will begin trading in Hong Kong on Jan. 27, while a secondary placing will held in Paris. Rusal’s 14.9 billion mountain of debt nearly put a stop to the Russian firm’s latest IPO attempt, but Hong Kong regulators granted approval with the caveat that retail investors be left out of the offering. Undeterred by the stipulation, Rusal has managed to lock in cornerstone investors that include Nathaniel Rothschild’s NR Investment, U.S. hedge fund Paulson & Co., Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok as well as the Russian state bank Vnesheconombank. Even Li Ka-shing’s Cheung Kong Holdings plans to invest 100 million in Rusal. The onetime richest man in Russia, Oleg Deripaska, controls Russia. Proceeds from its IPO will be used to pay down some of the company’s debts. Rusal’s IPO is tapping into rising investor sentiment in China and Hong Kong that saw the CSI 300 Index surge close to 97% while the Hang Seng Index rose 52% last year. China’s three stock exchanges dominated the market for IPOs in 2009, both in the number of transactions and value of the deals completed, according to Dealogic. Chinese companies raised 50.4 billion in 183 deals while IPOs in the U.S. raised 24 billion in 54 new listings. Comments are turned off for this post.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How did the attack plotters avoid detection?\\" is \\"They kept moving around\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the 9/11 attack plotters were able to avoid detection by using ordinary methods to move, store, and spend their money. Their tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough to defeat the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The plotters utilized funds provided by KSM (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed) and al-Qaeda, enabling them to travel to the United States, train, and live without raising suspicion. By blending in with standard financial practices and keeping a low profile, the plotters successfully evaded detection until the attack occurred."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: A shelf holding things you eat that need to be kept cold would be inside what? Choices: - refrigerator - cupboard - bookstore - corner - antarctica The rationale to choose \\"refrigerator\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"refrigerator.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"refrigerator\\" as the answer is based on the purpose and functionality of a refrigerator, as well as the other options provided. A refrigerator is a home appliance designed to preserve food at low temperatures, typically between 35°F and 38°F (2°C and 3°C). It prevents the growth of bacteria, which slows down the spoilage of food items like dairy products, meats, fruits, and vegetables, as well as prepared and cooked foods. The shelf inside a refrigerator serves as a storage area for these perishable items that need to be kept cold. Examining the other choices: - Cupboard: A cupboard is a type of storage cabinet found in kitchens or other areas where food items and kitchenware are kept. However, it does not have a cooling function, and it is typically used for storing dry, non-perishable goods. - Bookstore: A bookstore is a place where books, magazines, and other printed materials are sold. It is not related to food storage or preservation. - Corner: A corner is the point or area where two lines, surfaces, or edges meet. It does not refer to a specific object or location, and it is not associated with food storage or preservation. - Antarctica: Antarctica is a continent located at the Earth's southernmost region, and it is well-known for its extreme cold temperatures. Although the cold temperatures might theoretically preserve food, it is not a practical or realistic location for keeping your food cold in a household context. Based on the given choices and their functionalities, the most suitable answer is \\"refrigerator,\\" as it directly relates to maintaining cold temperatures for food items and increasing their shelf life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: Is darkness the absence of light, or is light the absence of darkness? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let's break down your profile to assess your chances of getting admitted to top universities for a Master's in Information Systems (MIS) in the US: 1. GRE score: Your score of 325 out of 340 is a competitive score for most universities. It would be useful to know the breakdown of your Verbal and Quantitative scores to understand if there is a potential weakness in any one section. 2. CGPA: Your 8.8 CGPA indicates a strong academic background and would be considered favorable across universities. 3. Work Experience: With 2.5 years of work experience, you have a competitive profile, considering that MIS programs value relevant work experience. The relevancy of your experience in the IT or related industry can strengthen your application. 4. No Research Papers: While research papers can be an asset to your application, they aren't necessarily a deal-breaker, particularly in a professional Master's program like MIS. Considering these factors, some of the best universities you could target for MIS in the US are: 1. Carnegie Mellon University (Heinz College) 2. University of Texas at Austin (McCombs School of Business) 3. University of Arizona (Eller College of Management) 4. Indiana University Bloomington (Kelley School of Business) 5. University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (Carlson School of Management) Please note that school rankings and admission criteria can change over time, so it's important to do thorough research and consult reliable resources. Applying to a mix of institutions (reach, target, and safety schools) will improve your chances of securing admission in a suitable MIS program. As for your second question: \\"Is darkness the absence of light, or is light the absence of darkness?\\" This question broadly delves into the nature of light and darkness. Darkness can be considered the absence of light, as darkness is the natural state without the presence of light energy. On the other hand, light is an energy form in the shape of photons, which can be emitted, absorbed, or reflected. Light is not the absence of darkness; rather, it exists independently as a physical phenomenon. Regarding the question: \\"Are these two questions asking the same thing?\\" No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question aims to determine the most suitable US universities for admission to an MIS program based on your academic and professional profile. The second question aims to explore the nature of light and darkness and whether one can be considered the absence of the other. These questions are unrelated and focus on two different subjects: higher education and physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home.

Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV.

Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership. - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - This article is a list of cover versions recorded and released by the Beatles as a band or solo artists . - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. What is the relationship between 'list of songs covered by the beatles' and 'song'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'list of songs covered by the Beatles' and 'song' is that the list contains specific songs that were originally performed and recorded by other artists, and later covered (reinterpreted and recorded) by the Beatles as a band or as solo artists. The term 'song' refers to a musical composition, typically consisting of vocals and instrumentals, while the list represents a collection of such songs covered by the Beatles during their respective careers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would the council feel as a result? Possible answers: like Skylar undermined them, angry and mad, like Skylar approves of them","completion":"In the given context, Skylar has damned the council's proposal with faint praise, suggesting that he/she is not convinced of its merit or practicality. This implies that Skylar has given an insincere or backhanded compliment, potentially disguising the true nature of their opinion. As a result, the council might feel a mix of emotions. 1. Feeling undermined: The council might feel like Skylar undermined their authority, competence, and expertise. Given that the proposal presumably came from a well-thought-out process and discussion among the council members, Skylar's response might make them feel like their work, knowledge, and judgment have been challenged or degraded. 2. Angry and mad: The council might interpret Skylar's remarks on the proposal as condescending, passive-aggressive, or patronizing. They may feel like Skylar intentionally gave a disguised criticism, couched in the language of faint praise. Such a response could cause resentment and frustration among council members, potentially leading to anger and feelings of animosity. 3. Confused about Skylar's approval: Skylar's damning of the proposal with faint praise might also leave the council uncertain about where Skylar genuinely stands on the matter. While faint praise could be implied as a form of approval, the damning aspect of Skylar's comment suggests that he/she thinks the proposal is flawed. This ambiguity might make the council wonder whether Skylar truly supports or rejects their proposal, leading to confusion and frustration. In conclusion, it is most likely that the council would feel a combination of being undermined, anger and confusion regarding Skylar's approval. Skylar's damning of the council's proposal with faint praise can be seen as a subtle form of criticism that might leave the council feeling uncertain, annoyed, and questioning their own abilities or the adequacy of their proposal. Open communication and clarification of Skylar's stance could help the council better understand the intent and implications of Skylar's response, potentially leading to a more productive and amicable resolution of the issue at hand."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Pick your answer from: (i). yes; (ii). it is not possible to tell; (iii). no;","completion":"(i) Yes The premise clearly states that the largest part of the foundation's work is dealing with matters of family divorce, custody, child support, and so on. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"Family divorce, custody and child support is some of what the foundation deals with\\" is true. In more detail, when evaluating the validity of a hypothesis, it is crucial to examine the substance of the premise or premises provided. The principle at play here is one of logical consistency – for a hypothesis to hold true, it should not contradict the assertions or facts presented in the premises, and should potentially be supported by them. In this case, the premise establishes that the foundation's main area of focus is on issues related to family divorce, custody, and child support. The hypothesis in question, which asserts that the foundation handles issues related to family divorce, custody, and child support, aligns perfectly with the premise. It does not contradict any part of the premise's statements and is indeed supported by them, hence making it valid and true. It's important to note that while the premise mentions these areas as the biggest part of the foundation's work, the hypothesis is careful not to limit the foundation's work only to these matters. The hypothesis states: \\"Family divorce, custody, and child support is some of what the foundation deals with.\\" The language used here allows for the foundation to possibly deal with other unrelated matters as well, keeping it open-ended and not in contradiction with the premise.

If the volcano gets really hot inside, it can increase the pressure and intensity of eruptions. The increased temperature can cause the magma to become less viscous, making it easier to flow and potentially leading to more significant eruptions. Additionally, the higher temperature can cause more gases to be released from the magma, further increasing the pressure within the volcano.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Bailey?\\", is \\"Guilty\\" a valid answer? Options: [1]. Yes. [2]. No. The answer is:","completion":"[2]. No. The term \\"guilty\\" is not a valid answer to describe Bailey in this scenario. \\"Guilty\\" generally refers to someone being responsible for a wrongful action or crime. While Bailey's behavior - using trickery to control the new students - can be considered manipulative or deceitful, it does not necessarily indicate that they are guilty of a crime. Instead, alternative terms can be used to describe Bailey's actions more accurately. For instance, Bailey can be described as cunning, shrewd, or calculating because they utilized deceit and manipulation to control the new students, which demonstrates an underlying cleverness or perceptiveness. Furthermore, calling Bailey \\"manipulative\\" is also valid, as they were direct in their efforts to influence the group of new students through deception.

Q:Information: - Fossil Record is a biannual peer-reviewed scientific journal covering palaeontology. It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde). - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered. - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon . - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to freshen up your look without spending hours in front of the mirror, Binky has got you covered. Binky, a renowned beauty expert, has curated a simple yet stunning spring look that's perfect for those of us with busy schedules. Step 1: Avoid a thick layer of make-up Binky suggests that the key to a fresh daytime look is not to overdo your make-up. She recommends avoiding a thick layer of foundation and opting for a lightweight BB or CC cream instead. This will help you achieve a more natural look while still providing coverage for any blemishes or uneven skin tone. Additionally, these creams usually contain SPF, making them an excellent choice for protecting your skin during the sunnier spring days. Step 2: Emphasize your eyes To create a soft and polished look that works well for daytime, Binky advises focusing on your eyes. She recommends using neutral eyeshadow shades, such as soft browns and tans, to give your eyelids a subtle wash of color. To enhance the appearance of longer lashes, apply a lengthening or volumizing mascara. This will draw attention to your eyes without appearing too dramatic. Step 3: Add a touch of color For your lips, Binky endorses a sheer lip tint or balm with a hint of color. This will add a touch of brightness to your face without looking too bold for a daytime look. Moreover, it helps keep your lips hydrated which is especially important as the weather warms up. Similarly, add a light flush to your cheeks using a cream or gel blush in a natural tone. This will give your skin a healthy, rosy glow that complements the season. Step 4: Keep your brows in check Well-groomed eyebrows frame the face and tie the whole look together. Binky recommends using a brow pencil or powder to fill in any sparse areas and a tinted brow gel to hold the hairs in place. Remember to choose a shade that matches your natural hair color, and use a light hand while applying as too much pressure can create an unnatural-looking finish. Conclusion: With Binky's expert tips, you can easily freshen up your beauty routine and create a stunning spring look in no time, even if you're in a rush. By keeping your make-up light and emphasizing your eyes, lips, and brows, you'll achieve a radiant appearance perfect for the season. So go ahead and embrace spring with a revitalized beauty routine that's both quick and effortless."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With an estimated 400,000 residents, the Okanagan Country spans from the Thompson Plateau near Grindrod, British Columbia in the Okanagan to the Okanagan Highland near Douglas County, Washington in the Okanogan. The largest city in the Canadian portion is Kelowna, with 117,312 residents as of 2011, while the largest city in the American portion is Omak, with 4,881 residents as of 2011. The region took its current name in honor of the Okanagan term, \\"uknaqín\\". The mild climate and close proximity to lakes, rivers and mountainous regions make the Okanagan Country an outdoor recreational destination. The region's economy is dominated by the primary industries of agriculture and forestry, although economic diversification has also occurred with retirement communities and recreational tourism. The American portion is considered to be more remote than the Canadian division, with approximately 10 percent of the population. - Yale - East was a provincial electoral district in the British Columbia legislature that appeared only in the 1894 , 1898 and 1900 elections .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly? Options: A. the payment was made without his knowledge B. not enough information C. he wanted this payment to remain private D. his lawyer insisted on handling all transfers of funds on behalf of his clients","completion":"C. he wanted this payment to remain private"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we invite you to join us on this creative journey as we take you through a step-by-step guide on crafting an intricate paper design, guaranteed to impress your friends and family. So, let's dive in and discover the world of paper folding. Step 1: Fold the Paper in Half For this design, we will use a standard sheet of paper (8.5\\" x 11\\" works well). Begin by folding the paper in half lengthwise, bringing the two shorter edges together. Make sure the edges are neatly aligned, and firmly crease the fold. Step 2: Fold a Second Time in the Same Direction Once you have folded the paper in half, continue folding in the same direction to create another, smaller rectangle. Press down firmly on the fold to create a sharp crease. Step 3: Unfold the Paper Carefully unfold the paper back to its original size, revealing the two creases you made in the previous steps. Step 4: Fold the Paper in Half in the Opposite Direction Now, it's time to fold the paper in half widthwise (hamburger-style). Align the edges evenly, and press down firmly on the fold. Step 5: Fold the Paper in Half Again in the Same Direction Just as before, continue folding in the same direction to create a smaller square shape. Press down firmly on the fold, ensuring a clean crease. Step 6: Unfold the Paper Completely Carefully unfold the paper again, returning it to its original size. You will notice a grid pattern of creases, which will guide the next steps in the process. Step 7: Fold the Paper in Half \\"Hamburger Style\\" Again Refold the paper in half widthwise, aligning the edges and pressing down firmly on the fold. Step 8: Cut Along the Three Creases on the Spine With a pair of scissors, carefully cut along the three vertical creases on the folded edge of the paper, being cautious not to cut to the edge. Step 9: Unfold the Page Unfold the paper completely, revealing the cuts made in the previous step. Step 10: Cut the Slats Now, using the horizontal creases as guides, cut six slats evenly spaced along the length of the paper. Step 11: Fold the Four Flaps Back Fold the four flaps created by the slats back towards the center crease. Step 12: Turn the Page Over Carefully flip the sheet of paper over to reveal the backside. Step 13: Fold the Top and Bottom to the Center Bring the top and bottom edges of the paper to the central horizontal crease, forming two rectangular flaps. Step 14: Fold the Sheet in Half \\"Hot Dog Style\\" Fold the paper in half lengthwise, bringing the two long edges together. Step 15: Push the Left and Right Sides Together Push the left and right sides of the folded paper together, creating a diamond shape. Step 16: Gather the Paper into an X Shape Gently pinch and gather the paper at the center point, resulting in an X shape. Step 17: Fold in Half at the Center Lastly, fold the paper in half along the center of the X shape, completing the intricate design. Conclusion: Congratulations, you have successfully created a stunning and complex paper design using simple folding and cutting techniques. These versatile paper creations are perfect for adorning greeting cards, decorating gifts, or simply showcasing your artistic talents. Fold your way into a world of creativity and endless possibilities with the mesmerizing art of paper folding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Read this article and answer this question The Dolphins entered their second game of the season with a 0-1 record, hosting the 0-1 Oakland Raiders. The game marked the third consecutive season game between the two teams and 36th all-time, with the Dolphins winning the last two games with an average margin of victory of 18 points. Miami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 64-yard touchdown to Mike Goodson tying the game. Through a majority of the second quarter both teams had a hard time moving across the 50-yard line, which was matched with impressive punting by both Dolphins punter Brandon Fields and Oakland punter Shane Lechler. By the end of the game Field punted the ball six times for 319 yards with an average yard per punt of 53.2 and Lechler punted the ball nine times for 422 yards with an average yard per punt of 46.9. However, Oakland managed to get the ball back with (3:33) left in the quarter and orchestrated a drive that ended with a Sebastian Janikowski 25-yard field goal. Both teams entered halftime evenly matched. It didn't take long following halftime for the Dolphins rushing attack to shine. On the second possession of the half the Dolphins drove the ball down field and allowed Reggie Bush to rush for a 25-yard touchdown. On the next Miami possession, after a quick pass from Tannehill to receiver Brian Hartline, Reggie Bush rushed 65 yards for another Miami touchdown. A few possessions later Oakland answered with a Janikowski 27-yard field goal. With little opposition from the Oakland defense Miami's offense kept the ball moving and managed to score on their next two possessions. Once with an Anthony Fasano 14-yard reception touchdown from Tannehill, the first of his career, and again with a Lamar Miller 15-yard rushing touchdown, the first of his career. Oakland tried to stop the bleeding on their next drive, but quarterback Palmer was intercepted by safety Reshad Jones.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and... Question: After this passage, the writer probably === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"Agrees with the concept of using constraints to enhance creativity in filmmaking. The passage discusses Heidi Philipsen's article, which argues that constraints can help boost creativity in film making processes. The focus on organizational influence and the positive impact of constraints on students at The Film School in Denmark further reinforces the writer's agreement with the concept. Additionally, the writer's mention of Csikzentmihalyi's quote on the importance of hard work in creativity further supports the idea that constraints and structure can positively impact one's creative process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This statement is not very coherent and clearly structured but we can still identify some key points: 1. The speaker seems to believe that it's better for the husband to think about doing something rather than being told to do it. 2. The speaker mentions that if they wanted their husband to help, it was a big thing in their house for a long time. Step 2: Evaluate the hypothesis against the premise The hypothesis is: \\"I have no problem asking my husband to help me out around the house; he has plenty of spare time!\\" From the premise, there is no direct mention or indication about the husband's spare time. Therefore, we can't conclude that this part of the hypothesis is true based on the premise. Regarding the part about having no problem asking the husband for help, the premise seems to suggest that it has been a big issue in their house for a long time if the speaker wanted their husband to help. This implies that the speaker might have had some hesitations or difficulties in asking for help. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the analysis of the premise and comparison with the hypothesis, we cannot fully conclude that the hypothesis \\"I have no problem asking my husband to help me out around the house; he has plenty of spare time!\\" is true. The premise suggests that there might have been issues in asking for help, and it does not provide information about the husband's spare time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Soft metal will show dents, and also indicate the size of the hail. Can we infer the following? Hail damage contains a qqq","completion":"Yes, we can infer that identifying hail damage involves a systematic process to ensure accurate assessment. Hail damage can be recognized by examining various aspects of a property, particularly its exterior components and structure. However, it is important to note that the term \\"qqq\\" does not seem to be related to hail damage. I will provide a detailed overview of how to spot hail damage: 1. Inspect the Roof: Begin by examining the roof, as it is the most exposed to hail damage. Look for visible dents, cracks, or missing shingles. Pay special attention to areas with soft materials or metal roofing components, such as ridge caps, metal valleys, gutters, and downspouts. 2. Check the Siding and Windows: Examine the sides of your home or building for any signs of damage caused by hail. Look for dents, cracks, or chipping in the siding material (wood, vinyl, aluminum, or stucco). Inspect the windowpanes, trim, and sashes for any signs of damage or punctures. 3. Inspect Outdoor Items: Review any outdoor items exposed to the elements during the hailstorm, such as patio furniture, air conditioning units, and pool equipment. Hail damage can cause dents or cracks in these items, which can serve as an indicator of the extent of the damage. 4. Assess Damage on Automobiles: If vehicles were left outside during the hailstorm, inspect them for dents, cracked glass, and other signs of hail damage. This can help you gauge the size of hailstones and the severity of the storm. 5. Monitor for Leaks and Water Damage: After a hailstorm, monitor your home or building for any leaks or water infiltration, which could indicate damage to the roof or other areas. Check the attic, ceilings, and walls for water stains that may develop over time. 6. Contact a Professional: When in doubt, contact a professional roofing contractor or property inspector experienced in identifying hail damage. Professionals can provide an accurate assessment of the damage and recommend appropriate repairs or replacement measures. 7. Document the Damage: Take photographs and notes about any hail damage discovered on the property. This will be important for insurance claims and can help to serve as a record of the storm's impact on your home or building. 8. Beware of Scams: Be cautious of roofing contractors or individuals claiming to offer hail damage repairs but asking for immediate payment or using high-pressure sales tactics. Research any contractor or company, and verify their credibility by checking on references, licenses, and insurance. In conclusion, identifying hail damage involves a multi-step process that considers various aspects of a property. However, the term \\"qqq\\" does not seem to be relevant to hail damage. Instead, focus on conducting a thorough inspection, documenting any damage discovered, and contacting a professional if necessary. Remember to be cautious when it comes to hiring contractors or companies for hail damage repair to avoid scams and unscrupulous individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: Where is Camp Humphreys located?

On his twelfth birthday (July 31) Harry is visited by Dobby, a house-elf, who warns Harry that he will be in mortal danger if he returns to Hogwarts. Harry ignores Dobby's warning and is determined to return. It turns out that Dobby has been collecting Harry's letters to make it seem as though his friends had forgotten him, hoping Harry might then not want to return to Hogwarts. Seeing that he will have to use force, Dobby decides to destroy, by the use of a charm, a large cake that Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) has baked for an important dinner party attended by Vernon Dursley's (Richard Griffiths) boss and his wife. Harry is blamed by the Ministry of Magic for Dobby's charm, and is told that if he does magic outside school again, he will be expelled. On learning that Harry cannot perform magic outside school, the Dursleys, previously fearful of his wizarding, lock Harrys books and wand away and Vernon Dursley fits bars onto his bedroom window, making Harry a prisoner.A few days later, Fred, George (James and Oliver Phelps) and Ron Weasley come to his rescue in their father's enchanted Ford Anglia.

When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Which student read less about the activation energy barrier? Answer:","completion":"From the given information, it appears that Gabe read less about the activation energy barrier than Sean. The rationale behind this distinction is based on the subjects each student focused on while studying chemical reactions. Sean directed his attention towards the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. In the context of the provided explanation, increasing the temperature of a reaction often leads to a higher reaction rate because it causes the reactant particles to move faster. This increased movement results in more frequent and forceful collisions between particles, allowing them to overcome the activation energy barrier and proceed to form products. Since Sean's study concentrated on the temperature aspect of chemical reactions, it can be inferred that he must have read about the activation energy barrier and its role in the said context. On the other hand, Gabe was said to have studied other influencing factors on chemical reactions – factors apart from the influence of temperature. His focus might have been on catalysts, concentration, surface area, or pressure, which may not necessarily involve a direct understanding of the activation energy barrier. Due to the broader scope of Gabe's study, it becomes difficult to establish a clear connection between the activation energy barrier and the other factors he may have investigated. Based on the available information, it is more likely that Gabe read less about the activation energy barrier as his focus was not specifically on the temperature aspect, which directly addresses the energy barrier and its role in chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - You must draw up a plan to what kind of orbit the satellite will travel - You make preparations for the rocket that will travel into space - Prepare the crew that will send it there - You begin the countdown date for the rocket - And then you send the rocket carrying the satellite into space - Once in orbit the satellite will be placed where it was planned.","completion":"The missing first step is: Determine the purpose and specifications of the satellite that will be launched."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

Germany is officially the Federal Republic of Germany, a federal parliamentary republic. A republic, as mentioned, is a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. Normally, a republic excludes a monarchy, and the term is used in the official names of 147 out of the world's 206 sovereign states.

So, the equation becomes: 256*n - 2580 = 1516 Step 2: Add 2580 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with n. 256*n - 2580 + 2580 = 1516 + 2580 This simplifies to: 256*n = 4096 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 256 to find the value of n. 256*n / 256 = 4096 / 256 This simplifies to: n = 16 So, the solution to the problem is n = 16."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: Coming off their road win over the Panthers, the Eagles played their Week 2 home opener against the New Orleans Saints. Due to the rib injury to quarterback Donovan McNabb, backup quarterback Kevin Kolb was named the starter. In the first quarter, Philadelphia trailed as Saints quarterback Drew Brees completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston. The Eagles would answer with Kolb completing a 71-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson, but New Orleans replied with kicker John Carney making a 23-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Philadelphia would tie the game again as kicker David Akers got a 23-yard field goal. However, the Saints struck back as Brees hooked up with Colston again on a 25-yard touchdown pass. The Eagles would close out the half as Akers made a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New Orleans began to pull away as Brees completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to fullback Heath Evans, along with running back Mike Bell getting a 7-yard touchdown. Philadelphia would answer with Kolb completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jason Avant. In the fourth quarter, the Saints continued to pull away as running back Reggie Bush got a 19-yard touchdown run. The Eagles would get a score as Brees fumbled the ball out of his own end zone, giving Philadelphia a safety. However, the Saints closed out their victory march as safety Darren Sharper returned an interception 97 yards for a touchdown.","completion":"In the article about the Week 2 home opener between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New Orleans Saints, it mentions that Eagles' backup quarterback Kevin Kolb started the game due to a rib injury to Donovan McNabb.

But Grace told Bertha that she planned to stay in Clarkman's bookstore until the new term began. Grace had to do something to feed herself because her parents died many years ago. Bertha watched her friend's pale face. Just then she got a good idea. The next day when Grace came back, Bertha showed her an invitation letter from her aunt Margaret. \\"Grace, would you like to spend your holiday with us? I will help you find a part-time job in our town.\\" Grace cried after reading it. \\"Grace, please spend the holiday with me, or Margaret will be disappointed . I want you to be happy,\\" Bertha said. The holiday quickly passed by, and finally one letter from Margaret came to Bertha. \\"Bertha, Grace is the sweetest girl in the world, and I am very grateful to you for sending her here.\\" Question: Grace planned to _ for her summer holiday. Options: A: visit her aunt B: see her parents C: stay in Clarkman's bookstore D: work in a restaurant The answer is:","completion":"C: stay in Clarkman's bookstore In the given article, it is explicitly stated that Grace tells Bertha about her plans for the summer holiday, which is to stay in Clarkman's bookstore until the new term begins. This is because she needs to have a means of taking care of herself following the death of her parents that happened many years prior to the events of the story. Therefore, among the provided options, the one that accurately encapsulates Grace's plans for her summer holiday is option C: stay in Clarkman's bookstore. This answer correctly captures her intention to work instead of participating in leisure activities, like visiting her aunt (option A) or seeing her parents (option B) which are not mentioned anywhere in the text.

Here is a hypothesis: They have several business learning strategies. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that other strategies for business/technology learning include various informal activities such as newsletters, presentations, reports, and service-level results. Based on this premise, we can deduce that these are only a part of the several business learning strategies they employ to communicate the effectiveness of their CIO organizations. When analyzing this conclusion, it's important to note both the elements that make up the hypothesis and the way information is presented within the premise. The hypothesis states that they have several business learning strategies - this assertion aligns with the premise, which describes multiple informal activities for learning. The premise details some examples of informal learning strategies, breaking down the types of activities that might be undertaken to enhance business and technology learning. Specifically, the premise mentions newsletters, presentations, reports, and service-level results being placed in common areas. By presenting these examples, the premise supports the idea that these organizations are using a variety of different strategies for business learning, which further validates the hypothesis. While the premise does not explicitly outline every learning strategy implemented within the organizations, it provides enough evidence to support the hypothesis. Several informal activities are given as examples, implying that other strategies may also be in play in these organizations. In turn, the hypothesis that they have several business learning strategies can be considered true as long as the premise is true. In summary, given the premise is true, it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true as well. The premise provides enough information and examples to support the idea that multiple business learning strategies are being employed by these organizations, substantiating the hypothesis that they have several business learning strategies. So, if the premise holds true, then the hypothesis can be believed to be true as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Elkhan Mammadov was a football player during 2020.","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively draw the conclusion that Elkhan Mammadov was a football player during 2020. While his positions in various football organizations and committees indicate a strong connection to the sport, they do not specifically mention his football playing career or if he was an active player during 2020. Elkhan Mammadov's titles as General Secretary of Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan (AFFA), Project Leader for UEFA EURO 2020 Baku Bid, Vice-President of UEFA Fair Play and Social Responsibility Committee, and FIFA Fair Play and Social Responsibility Committee Member, all suggest prominent roles within football federations and organizations. These positions require in-depth knowledge of the sport, management skills, and possibly experience in the field – such as having played football at some point – but they do not necessarily mean that Mammadov was an active player in 2020. It is important to consider that professional football players typically transition into roles similar to those held by Mammadov after they retire from active play. Becoming involved in football governing bodies or working on projects related to football organization or social responsibility showcases their passion for and commitment to the sport. However, these roles are separate from having an active career as a football player. To conclude, the provided information does not allow us to make the statement that Elkhan Mammadov was a football player during 2020. Further research or details about his playing career would be necessary to determine if he was still playing in 2020 or if he had transitioned solely to roles within football organizations and committees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Corso grew up in foster homes, on the streets of Little Italy and Greenwich Village. Corso was sentenced to Clinton State Prison for stealing a 50 suit to go on a date; there, protected by Mafia inmates, Corso read his way through a three-year sentence and ended up at Harvard. He eventually met Allen Ginsberg at a dyke bar in the West Village. After Allen Ginsbergâs death, Corso goes \\"On the Road\\" to rediscover his creative Muse. From Paris to Venice, Rome to Athens, Mount Parnassus to Jim Morrisonâs grave, Corso reflects on the early days of \\"Beats.\\" In high humor he reveals how \\"The Beats\\" emerged in Europe, and paved the way for youth culture, the sexual revolution and even hip-hop. Corso interrupts his tour to revisit Clinton State Prison and inspire young inmates. Returning to Italy, Corso muses on his lost mother, who he believes is dead and buried in Italy. In a stunning discovery, filmmaker Gustave Reininger finds Corso's mother not dead in Italy, but alive in Trenton, N.J. Corso meets his mother on film and discovers she is the Muse he has been seeking.

I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work. This said, I should have LOVED 1408. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the \\"guy in a locked room\\" scenario. This wasn't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of \\"ouch, that's just WRONG,\\" combined with moments of \\"ouch, that's just painful,\\" and moments of \\"oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate\\" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before upping the ante...at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters \\"We've Only Just Begun.\\") it's mostly \\"stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!\\" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my age, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was \\"let's make him relive some of his most painful experiences\\" mindgaming, with \\"let's animate the paintings in creepy ways\\" cliché cheesiness. ******END SPOILERS***** I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the actors I mentioned above. We never find out the origin of the evil. We never get to see the evil defeated, though we can presume maybe it was defeated. And the ending was just a jarring \\"What?!\\" moment. Wait for it to come on cable. I wouldn't have minded paying for it as a matinée, but I'm feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it.","completion":"The sentiment of the review is predominantly negative, marked by the author's disappointment in the movie \\"1408\\" despite being a fan of the lead actors and having some appreciation for Stephen King's work. The reviewer's criticisms primarily focus on the perceived lack of continuity in the plot, excessive reliance on jump scares, and clichéd horror elements. The reviewer does offer some positive points about the film, such as the memorable argument between Olin and Enslin and the clever use of musical cues. However, these are not enough to outweigh their overall dissatisfaction with the movie, demonstrated by their comments on the unclear origin of the evil, an inconclusive ending, and their feeling of being shortchanged for paying opening night prices. In conclusion, the sentiment of the review is majorly negative with a few positive aspects mentioned. The reviewer's overall impression of \\"1408\\" is that it falls short of their expectations, and they recommend waiting for it to come on cable rather than paying to see it in theaters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience.

(ii) yes.","completion":"(i) no. The two questions you've asked are not paraphrases of each other. While both questions relate to admissions chances at Singapore universities, they focus on different aspects of the application process. Question 1: I have scored 93.8% in CBSE and attended an interview for a business management undergrad. course at SMU Singapore. What are my chances of getting through? This question primarily focuses on your chances of getting accepted into the business management undergraduate program at Singapore Management University (SMU) based on your CBSE score and interview performance. It's important to note that admission requirements and criteria vary across universities and programs. SMU considers various factors when evaluating applications, such as academic performance, extra-curricular activities, leadership capabilities, and communication skills. With a 93.8% CBSE score, you have a good academic standing, which should strengthen your application. Your interview performance plays an essential role as well, as it reflects your capabilities, character, and motivations for pursuing the program. However, it's difficult to predict the exact chances of getting accepted into the program, as it heavily depends on the applicant pool and your overall profile. Question 2: If I take SAT, and score reasonably well, will I get admission into NUS/NTU/SMU? This question focuses on the potential impact of taking the SAT and scoring reasonably well on your chances of gaining admission to three Singapore universities: National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Singapore Management University (SMU). While the SAT is not a mandatory requirement for admissions to NUS, NTU, and SMU, it can be helpful to enhance your application, especially if you come from a different educational background or curriculum. Scoring well on the SAT can showcase your academic abilities and improve your chances, but it's essential to consider that different universities and programs may still have specific requirements in addition to the SAT results. The inclusion of the SAT score may increase your chances of admission, but there's no guarantee of securing a place in any of these universities. Admission officers will consider your overall academic performance, extracurricular activities, leadership qualities, a well-rounded profile, and specific program requirements. A strong SAT score will contribute positively to your application but doesn't guarantee acceptance. In conclusion, while both questions are related to gaining admission to Singapore universities, they specifically focus on two distinct aspects: one on your CBSE score and an interview for a specific program at SMU, and the other on taking the SAT to enhance your admission chances across three Singapore universities.

The given information suggests that she was busy during one part of the day. Option 1 provides a consistent and logical reason for Susan to change her routine. Continuing the story: Susan changed her morning walk to the afternoon when she remembered she was busy in the morning all week. Her mornings were filled with an important project at work that required her full attention and longer hours in the office. Susan was determined not to break her exercise routine, so the afternoon seemed like the perfect time to get her daily walk in. As the week progressed, Susan discovered that she enjoyed the serenity and warmth of the afternoon sun. The vibrant colors of the autumn leaves and the gentle rustling of the wind through the trees brought a sense of peace to her usually busy days. She was glad she had made the change, at least for this week, and wondered if she should continue her walks in the afternoon, even after her work project was completed. Little did Susan know that her new afternoon routine was also about to introduce her to some friendly faces in the neighborhood. Her path crossed with a group of regular afternoon joggers, who welcomed her into their fold. They shared stories and laughs, and Susan soon found herself looking forward to not only the walks, but also the camaraderie she experienced with the group.

Sometimes when things change in our lives or we feel worried, we might eat more than usual. It's like when you're upset and want a treat to feel better. But they don't really know for sure.

Answer the question about text: For one reason or another ( we 're blaming the economy and the price of gasoline for the higher food prices ) , my house 's joint bank account ran dangerously low in funds before the end of March and the next round of paychecks . We use this account to pool our earnings so that we can pay for food , internet and phone services . We ' ve never had trouble budgeting before , but for whatever reason the last couple months have n't quite added up . What may be the reason for their financial issues ?","completion":"There could be several factors that have contributed to the financial issues experienced by the household mentioned in the text. Some possible reasons for the recent budgeting difficulties include: 1. Economic Factors: As stated in the text, the economy and the rising price of gasoline may be contributing factors. Gasoline prices tend to have a ripple effect on other aspects of the economy, such as transportation costs, making goods and services more expensive. As a result, the household may be facing higher grocery bills and other living expenses. 2. Unforeseen Expenses: The household may have encountered unexpected expenses in the last couple of months. This could include medical bills, vehicle repairs, or home maintenance costs that have strained the budget and impacted the joint bank account balance. 3. Job or Income Changes: One or more members of the household may have experienced changes in their job or income. This could include reduced work hours, a pay cut, or job loss. Consequently, less money has been contributed to the joint account, resulting in insufficient funds to cover expenses. 4. Higher Utility Costs: In addition to the price of gasoline, it's possible that other utility costs, such as electricity, water, or heating, have increased for the household. This could further strain the budget, especially if these costs were not accounted for in the original budget plan. 5. Overspending: The household may have been unintentionally overspending on non-essential items or entertainment, leading to a depletion of funds in the joint account by the end of the month. 6. Poor Budgeting and Financial Planning: It is also possible that the household's initial budget and financial planning strategies were not accurately accounting for all the expenses they incurred. As a result, they have been consistently underestimating their expenditures, leading to insufficient funds in the account. 7. Increase in Debts or Loan Payments: The household may have taken on additional debts or loans, leading to higher repayments. These increased financial obligations could be impacting the available funds in the joint account. 8. Changes in Financial Priorities: The household's financial priorities may have changed in recent months, leading to shifts in spending patterns and habits. For example, they may have decided to invest in education, health, or other long-term goals that require additional funds, causing strains on the joint account. To conclude, there may be various reasons for the financial issues the household is facing, ranging from broad economic factors to individual spending habits and circumstances. A thorough review of their spending patterns, budget, and financial priorities would be essential to identify the root causes and develop strategies to overcome the current challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg.

Please answer the following question: Have you ever sat around and thought about how you’d create your dream kitchen if you had the chance? Well, we are on the verge of a move (whenever the house sells, we’ll move), and I keep thinking that I need to sit down and write a list of our “would likes” and our “must haves.” That way, when we are house hunting, we’ll already know what we’re looking for. For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I’d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it’d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road! When you’re preparing a lot of food, you’re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn’t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I’d like not having to smell the garbage all the time!

Which entity is this text about? A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251-183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \\"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\\". A revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \\"Pretty Little Picture\\" and \\"That'll Show Him\\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \\"Echo Song\\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \\"Farewell\\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \\"Echo Song\\" and \\"Farewell\\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden. The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical. Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance. In addition, Jason Alexander, who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in Jerome Robbins' Broadway, also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.","completion":"This text is about the musical \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\\" which features music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.

(CNN) -- Wednesday's presidential debate might very well give Mitt Romney a significant boost, but the former governor still faces a difficult path. One of the more intriguing aspects of the 2012 election is that Mitt Romney might win a substantial majority among white voters while still losing the presidential election. Regardless of the outcome of this election, the rising minority share of the electorate will force a deep rethinking of Republican strategy. Back in 2008, John McCain won 55% of the non-Hispanic white vote against 43% for Barack Obama. It is worth noting that Obama increased the Democratic share of the white vote by 2 percentage points relative to Sen. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee. One is that the OPTIONS: - African-American should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Barack Obama should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - CNN should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Democratic should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - GOP should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - John Kerry should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - John McCain should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Latino should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Mitt Romney should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Obama should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Reihan Salam should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Republican should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - Salam should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. - non-Hispanic should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters.","completion":"Correct Answer: - GOP should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. Explanation: The passage discusses the challenges faced by the Republican Party (also referred to as GOP or Grand Old Party) in attracting minority votes. It suggests that the party may need to rethink its strategy given the growing minority electorate. Thus, the sentence logically concludes, \\"One is that the GOP should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters.\\" Incorrect Answers: All other options refer to individuals or other organizations which don't align with the overall context of the passage. The passage is about the challenges for the Republican Party in winning the presidential election and how they might need to change strategy due to the growing minority electorate. Therefore, it wouldn't make sense to claim that Barack Obama, John Kerry, John McCain, CNN, Reihan Salam, or any racial or ethnic group should build more support among white voters. The focus of the paragraph is the challenge for the Republican Party, not individuals or other entities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Angling is a method of fishing by means of an \\"angle\\" (fish hook). The hook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float, and a weight or sinker are sometimes used. - The common carp or European carp (\\"Cyprinus carpio\\") is a widespread freshwater fish of eutrophic waters in lakes and large rivers in Europe and Asia. The native wild populations are considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN, but the species has also been domesticated and introduced into environments worldwide, and is often considered a destructive invasive species, being included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species. It gives its name to the carp family Cyprinidae. - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - A fishing reel is a cylindrical device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and stowing line. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - A fish hook or fishhook is a device for catching fish either by impaling them in the mouth or, more rarely, by snagging the body of the fish. Fish hooks have been employed for centuries by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by \\"Forbes\\" as one of the top twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the fish hook. Fish hooks are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing). History. The fish hook or similar device has been made by man for many thousands of years. Neolithic fish hooks have been recorded from Palestine about 7000 BC. In 2011, archaeologists in the Jerimalai cave in East Timor discovered what was then the world's oldest fish hook, a shell hook between 16,000 and 23,000 years old.However finds also made from sea snails some 23,000 years ago and predating the East Timor finds were reported from Okinawa. An early written reference to a fish hook is found with reference to the Leviathan in the Book of Job 41:1; \\"Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?\\" Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animal and human bone, horn, shells, stone, bronze, iron up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. Quality steel hooks began to make... - A fishing line is a cord used or made for angling. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking strength, knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility. Most modern lines are made from nylon or silk. - The Cyprinidae are the family of freshwater fishes, collectively called cyprinids, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels). Also commonly called the \\"carp family\\", or \\"minnow family\\", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct species in about 370 genera. The family belongs to the ostariophysian order Cypriniformes, of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds. The family name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"kyprînos\\" (, \\"carp\\"). - A fishing rod is a long, flexible rod used to catch fish. At its simplest, a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an \\"angle\\", hence the term angling). The length of the rod can vary between . To entice fish, bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line. The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Carp are various species of oily freshwater fish from the family Cyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Angler's Mail is a weekly angling magazine published in London, UK, by IPC Media's Inspire division. - Benson ( 1984 -- 4 August 2009 ) was \`\` Britain 's biggest and best - loved '' common carp . Benson 's popularity was such that she was caught 63 times in 13 years , although the accessibility that made her popular was also the cause of controversy among angling 's elite .

The fish , who was female , was originally one of a pair : her original companion , Hedges , disappeared in a flood of the River Nene in 1998 . Both fish were named due to a hole in Benson 's dorsal fin that resembled a cigarette burn , in a reference to Benson and Hedges . At her peak weight , in 2006 , she weighed 64 pounds and 2 ounces ( 29 kg ) . Benson died on 4 August 2009 , aged 25 . At the time of her death , she weighed the same as a large dog and was worth £ 20,000 .

Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is a Chinese satellite navigation system that started being utilized at the most recent turn of the millennium. It comprises two separate satellite constellations: a limited test system in operation since 2000 and a full-scale global navigation system currently under construction. BeiDou was developed and deployed by China to provide an independent global navigation system to cater to various applications, such as vehicle tracking, transportation management, and location-based services, among others. The primary purpose of BDS is to reduce China's dependence on foreign satellite navigation systems, like GPS (Global Positioning System, US) and GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System, Russia). The development of BDS began in the 1990s, and in 2000, China launched the first two satellites of the limited test system, known as BeiDou-1, which provided regional coverage for navigation and timing services. This was followed by BeiDou-2, sometimes referred to as the Compass Navigation Satellite System, between 2007 and 2012. It marked the next significant step forward, expanding space segment and providing more precise regional coverage and better accuracy. In recent years, the BeiDou-3 project has been underway with the goal of establishing a full-scale global navigation system. With the completion of this system, BeiDou aims to deliver a global coverage network capable of providing a user range error of no more than 10 meters, positioning accuracy of about 10 centimeters (with differential correction), and timing accuracy of 10 billionths of a second, making it competitive with other global satellite navigation systems in the market. Moreover, BeiDou-3 satellites also support short message communication services besides navigation, traffic monitoring, and disaster prevention applications. This makes BDS a significant strategic asset not only for China's domestic applications but also international ones. Several countries have already signed agreements to implement BDS-based services, including Pakistan, Laos, UAE, and Algeria, amongst others. In conclusion, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is the Chinese satellite navigation system that started being utilized at the most recent turn of the millennium. It has evolved from a limited test system in 2000 to its current state of constructing a full-scale global navigation system capable of providing an independent alternative to other satellite navigation systems, like GPS and GLONASS. As this system expands globally, it will play an increasingly vital role in China's technological advancement, autonomy, and international collaborations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the \\"book of the century\\", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a 500,000 deal for the book.

I got the name of an insurance agent from a friend and called the agent to get some information. From the kinds of questions I put to him the agent could tell that I knew nothing about insurance, so he kindly offered to explore the matter with me in more detail---to help me determine the kind of policy I ought to be considering. That evening he appeared at my door promptly at 7:30; without wasting time on pleasantness, he spread his papers out on the kitchen table and launched into a lengthy explanation. I listened attentively as he talked about the difference between various types of policies, and he explained the kind of coverage he felt I ought to have. Toward the end of the evening (after three or four hours of talking), he kindly helped me fill out an application for a 50,000 policy, and then he asked if I could go to a Dr. Luther's office on Friday for a physical examination. I don't know why, but it was not until the mention of the doctor's appointment that I realized fully what was happening.

Anyways, we were sat down in the same section as a group of 30+ - who sat down not too long before us. We raised our eyebrows at each other and hoped we wouldn't suffer their extremly large group - all sitting at the same table. Well, there were a few tiny mistakes - but they were redeemed excellently. Small things like they forgot one of our sides -which by the time we remembered we were so full and didn't mind but when we asked they brought it right out and comp'd it apologetically. Said they wanted us to at least try it even if we didnt finish it because it was excellent - and it WAS! It was their mac n cheese and it was rich and worth the wait. Everything we put in our mouth was delish - i will say I liked all of the appetizers more than the mains. They all seemed a bit more excotic while the entrees were more hearty comfort foodish to me. Now, I'm not complaining, I just wish we would have ordered more appetizers is all and will do this next time around. The crab salad was divine and probably my favorite dish of the evening. But my second was the grapefruit souflet - oh wow it was awesome. The only other mistake was i ordered a glass of wine with desert while everyone else ordered cappuccino. The capps and dessert came but my wine didn't. When we were finally able to flag down the manager our waiter brought it out about 5 minutes later - again compd it and apologized in a cute joking kind of way. Very kind and efficient service.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in Kassel. Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (who is deceased) and David. Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time. In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered 1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers--young kids for the most part--helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country. Willis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \\"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\\" The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \\"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\\" What other military connections did he have?","completion":"Besides growing up in a military family, Willis has depicted several military characters in films and visited Iraq as part of the USO tour to support the troops.

Here is an article: The charging of Dzhokar Tsamaev with using a weapon of mass destruction brings an end to an intense legal debate here in the US on whether he should be accused of a crime or an act of war. Many Republicans, former presidential candidate John McCain among them, wanted to see the 19-year-old held indefinitely, questioned without any of the usual warnings that he has the right to remain silent and the right to legal representation. They would like to see him interrogated to gain intelligence about the operation in Boston including if anyone else knew of his alleged plans to bomb the race, if anyone funded his operation and perhaps the most crucial question of all; if someone had directed the operation. Yet the FBI and the Boston police essentially ruled that out when they announced after Tsamaev’s capture on Friday night that the city’s nightmare was over and the “terror” had ended. The US attorney handling the investigation said on Friday that Tsmaev had not been charged when he was pulled bloody and barely clinging to life from the boat where he hid during the massive manhunt which shut down one of the country’s biggest cities. At the time that appeared to be a tactical decision. Yet it may have been simply that the accused was so badly injured he was unable to respond to the most basic question after being given his Miranda Rights as they are known: “Do you understand?’. Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor and well-known defence lawyer thought the idea of treating the Boston Marathon suspect was a non-starter. “This is an American citizen being tried for a crime that occurred domestically, and there is simply no way to treat him like an enemy combatant — not even close,” he said. There is an exceptional provision which allows prosecutors not to read the rights if there is an ongoing and immediate danger to the public. Given the statements from the police and the FBI, civil liberties campaigners were concerned the rules were being twisted. In a statement issued on Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director, Anthony Romero said: “Every criminal defendant has the right to be brought in front of a judge and to have access to counsel. We must not waver from our tried and true justice system even in the most difficult times.” It has now been decided Tsamaev will face federal charges. White House spokesman Jay Carney said: “He will not be treated as an enemy combatant. We will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice.” It is possible that prosecutors will request the death penalty when this case gets to court and if the suspect is found guilty. That decision will be made by Attorney-General Eric Holder, although there is a protocol to be followed which will analyse all aspects of the crime before a request for a sentence can be made. It’s been suggested Democratic administrations are less likely to request the death penalty, but they did exactly that in the case of the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. One issue may be that Massachusetts does not have the death penalty on its statute books. That could allow a defence attorney to try to have the case heard in state court. For some, the legal and constitutional debate is nonsense. One woman who lives in Watertown, the site of Tsamaev’s capture, told one of my colleagues she was furious at anyone concerned for the suspect’s rights insisting that he had given them up ‘when he planted the bomb. What about the dead eight-year-old’s rights and what was lost?’ The authorities may already have a strong case against Tsamaev. They have videos of him and his brother Tamerlan at the scene of last Monday’s double bombing carrying backpacks like those forensic teams believe carried the explosives. They have an eye witness, a man whose legs were blown off, saying he saw one of the brothers place a bomb. And they say the Tsamaevs admitted to the bombings and killing a police officer to a man whose car they hijacked at gunpoint. It could be more than a year before any case comes to court. Defence attorneys may suggest the trial be moved from Boston because it would be difficult to get an impartial jury. Given how this has hit America – that may be difficult anywhere.

Born on January 1, 1859, in Mason County, West Virginia, USA, Owens made significant strides in the world of glassmaking during his lifetime. Owens started working in the glass industry at an early age, beginning as a glassware apprentice and eventually ascending the ranks to become the dominant figure he is remembered as today. His most significant project, the development of automated production of glass bottles, transformed the way glass bottles were manufactured and contributed to the growth of the commercial beverage industry. By eliminating the need for skilled labor in the bottle-making process, his invention, the Owens Bottle Machine, revolutionized glass production and greatly reduced costs, while increasing efficiency and standardization of bottle sizes. This automation made glass containers widely accessible and affordable. Consequently, his innovative work holds immense historical importance in the industrialization of glassmaking, and his patented device was licensed to glass manufacturers around the world. In recognition of his exceptional contributions to the industry, Michael J. Owens was awarded the prestigious Elliott Cresson Medal in 1915. This honor, bestowed upon him by the Franklin Institute, celebrated his ingenuity and his relentless pursuit of advancements in glassmaking technology. Michael Joseph Owens passed away on December 27, 1923, in Toledo, Ohio, USA.

A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient, originating in Arabic poetry in Arabia long before the birth of Islam. It is derived from the Arabian panegyric \\"qasida\\". The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, it is a genre that has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. - The Patiala gharana is one of the \\"gharanas\\" of vocal Hindustani classical music. It was founded by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and Ustad Ali Baksh Khan (known as Alia-fattu) and was initially sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala, Punjab and was known for ghazal, thumri, and khyal styles of singing. - Patiala is a city in southeastern Punjab, in northern India. It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of Patiala district. Patiala is located around the \\"Qila Mubarak\\" (the Fortunate Castle).

The style is sometimes called \\"North Indian classical music\\" or \\"Shstriya Sangt\\". It is a tradition that has been evolving since the 12th century CE, in North India. Today, it is one of the two subgenres of Indian classical music, the other being Carnatic music, the classical tradition of South India. - Khyal (or Khayal, Urdu: , Hindi: ) is the modern genre of classical singing in North India.

Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Interestingly, despite all his curiosity, Ken doesn't like any yeast to be around him. Which yeast sample would be used as a leavening agent, yeast A or yeast B? Hint: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

They need something called a \\"visa\\". A visa is like a special permission slip that allows people to visit, work, or live in another country for some time. Today, we are going to talk about a group of musicians who got into a little bit of trouble because they didn't have the right visa for their visit. Let me tell you the story. There are two groups of musicians in this story. One group is called \\"TTNG\\", and they are from a country called the United Kingdom. The other musician's name is Mylets, and he is from the United States. Both TTNG and Mylets wanted to go to Hong Kong to play music and have fun. Hong Kong is a place far away from both the United Kingdom and the United States. It's a region in Asia where people speak Chinese and English. Hong Kong has its own government and rules, and they are different from the rest of China. But something unexpected happened when TTNG and Mylets arrived in Hong Kong. These musicians were \\"arrested\\" by the police. Being arrested means that they were taken to the police station because they were suspected of breaking the rules or laws in Hong Kong. The reason TTNG and Mylets were arrested was that they did not have the right visas to play music in Hong Kong. This is like playing a game with friends, and someone does not follow the rules. The game is not as fun, and sometimes, people get upset. However, TTNG and Mylets were only \\"briefly\\" arrested. This means they were in the police station for a short time. The Hong Kong authorities checked their papers and made sure everything was okay. After that, they were allowed to leave the police station. It's like when you make a small mistake during a game, and everyone just moves forward after correcting the mistake. In the end, TTNG and Mylets learned a lesson about the importance of having the right visas when traveling to different countries. They needed permission from Hong Kong to play their music there and to follow the rules. As we grow older, it is essential to remember the lessons that stories like this teach us. When we visit new places, we should always respect the people, their rules, and their customs. This makes the world a better and more fun place for everyone. So that's the story, kids! Remember, when traveling to new places, make sure you have the right papers and permissions to enjoy your time there and respect the rules of the place you are visiting. And always be kind to others."},{"prompt":"Question: How did Michelle kill Tex? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\".

Federal Bureau of Investigation: In 1939, the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations. The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed. The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests. The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps (usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials) and grooming informants in order to monitor dissidents and \\"troublemakers.\\" After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: English is an important global language, but that doesn't mean it's easy to learn. Many experts have tried to make English easier for students to learn--but they weren't always successful. In 1930, Professor CK Ogden of Cambridge University invented Basic English. It had only 850 words (and just eighteen verbs) and Ogden said most people could learn it in just thirty hours. The problem was that people who learned Basic English could write and say simple messages, but they couldn't understand the answers in \\"real\\" English! It was also impossible to explain a word if it wasn't in the Basic English word list. For example, if you wanted a watermelon, you asked for \\"a large green fruit with the form of an egg, which has a sweet red inside and a good taste\\"! RE Zachrisson, a university professor in Sweden, decided that the biggest problem for learners of English was spelling, so he invented a language called Anglic. Anglic was similar to English, but with much simpler spelling. \\"Father\\" became \\"faadher\\", \\"new\\" became \\"nue' and \\"years\\" became \\"yeerz\\". Unfortunately for some students of English, Anglic never became popular. Even easier is the language which ships' captains use: it's called \\"Seaspeak\\". Seaspeak uses a few simple phrases for every possible situation. In Seaspeak, for example, you don't say, \\"I'm sorry what did you say?\\" or \\"I didn't understand, can you repeat that?\\" It's just \\"Say again.\\" No more grammar! In the age of international communication through the Internet who knows? ... a new form of English might appear.

In many ways, the television ads today are almost the same to those two decades ago. Most television ads still feature actors, still run 30 or 60 seconds, and still show a product. However, the different medium of the Internet causes unique challenges to advertisers, forcing them to adapt their practices and techniques. In the early days of Internet marketing, online advertisers used banner and pop-up ads to attract customers. These techniques reached large audiences, led to many sales leads, and came at a low cost. However, a small number of Internet users began to consider these advertising techniques annoying. Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings. When companies began pouring billions of dollars into this emerging medium, online advertising specialists started to notice the presence of what would later be called click fraud : representatives of a company with no interest in the product advertised by a competitor click on the competitor's ads simply to...

Movie title: Jaws 2 Movie plot: Two divers are photographing the wreck of the Orca, Quint's boat from the first film, and are suddenly attacked and killed by a large great white shark, but not before one of the divers' camera gets a photo of the shark's eye. The shark later prowls the coastal waters of Amity Island, killing a female water skier. The female driver of the speedboat tries to defend herself by first throwing a gasoline tank at the shark (accidentally spilling some on herself) and then igniting the fuel with a flare gun. The fire ignites the gas tank and the speedboat explodes, killing the driver and leaving the shark heavily scarred on the right side of his head.In addition to these incidents, a dead killer whale is beached at a nearby lighthouse with large wounds all over its body, which Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) suggests were caused by a great white shark. Once again, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't share Brody's belief that the town has another shark problem and warns him not to do something hasty. Later, Brody spots a section of a ruined speedboat bobbing in the surf just off the beach. When he goes to retrieve it, he encounters the burnt remains of the female speedboat driver.Brody angrily grounds his son Mike (Mark Gruner) because of his reluctance to find a summer job, preferring to go sailing every day, and gives him a job at the beach. The following day, while Brody is in an observation tower, he sees a large shadow produced by a school of bluefish, which he mistakes for a shark. In his haste, Brody orders everyone out of the water and fires his gun, causing a panic. Later that evening, he receives the photo of the shark's eye, taken by one of the attacked divers. Brody shows it to Vaughn and his Townsmen, but they refuse to accept the evidence put in front of them. Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo) (who has built a new resort in Amity to attract people) and the town council fire Brody for the beach incident, with Mayor Vaughn being the only one to vote against dismissal, and promote Deputy Hendricks... Answer:","completion":"In Jaws 2, a group of teenagers, including Mike Brody and his friends, get trapped on their sailboats after they are capsized or damaged by the great white shark. They struggle to stay afloat and alive while Chief Brody, now aware of the shark's presence, tries to rescue them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: – The White House has been trying to dampen expectations about first-month enrollment in ObamaCare, and here's why: The administration said today that 26,794 people signed up in October via the federal HealthCare.gov website, reports AP. About 80,000 more signed up on state-run exchanges. Prior to the launch of ObamaCare, White House officials predicted about 500,000 would be on board by now—on both the federal and state exchanges—but the final tally came in at 106,185. That's a decent snapshot of just how badly the federal HealthCare.gov website has performed: It covers people in 36 states, while the 14 states running their own marketplaces managed to about triple its total. The number of enrollees reflects those who have selected a plan, not necessarily paid for it, notes Politico. The federal number is actually lower than what the Wall Street Journal reportedly previously, but at least it's up from the whopping first-day total of ... six.","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a big house called the White House and they made a plan called ObamaCare. ObamaCare was a way to help people in the country get health insurance. The White House was very excited and thought 500,000 people would join in the first month. But, when they opened their website called HealthCare.gov, it didn't work very well. So, only 26,794 people were able to join using that website. Oops! Luckily, there were other websites run by 14 states, and 80,000 people were able to join there. So, in total, 106,185 people joined ObamaCare in the first month. That's not as many as the White House hoped for, but it's better than only six people on the first day! Remember, these numbers are about people who picked a health insurance plan. They might not have paid for it yet, but they at least found one they liked.

This might sound like a small detail, but I've found it to be a surprisingly fun and engaging element. It's rewarding to see your own personal \\"flip history,\\" especially when using the app to make recurring decisions. The app's stability has also been top-notch.

Fake!, his previous book about art forger Elmyr de Hory, had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a Life editor deems it unsatisfactory. Vacationing with his friend and researcher Richard Suskind, Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to New York City to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the \\"book of the century\\", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a 500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book. At the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he'll be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of Noah Dietrich, a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What might a kid do with his friend before going to play? Possible A: laugh, sit, being entertained, math, meet Why is \\"meet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Meet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it signifies the initial point of contact between two friends before they engage in any activity together, such as playing. Oftentimes, friends need to meet at a specific location or time before they can start their planned activities. This is especially true for kids, who, unlike adults, typically have limited modes of private transportation and may not have constant access to communication devices like mobile phones. Therefore, meeting is a crucial step in arranging and coordinating shared experiences. In contrast, the other possible answers do not generally align with the logical prelude to playing. Here's a brief analysis of each: 1. \\"Laugh\\": Laughing is a spontaneous expression of amusement and joy, which might occur during or after playing, rather than before; it is not a precursor to play but rather a byproduct of enjoyment. 2. \\"Sit\\": Sitting is usually associated with stationary or passive activities such as resting, eating, or engaging in conversation. Although it is plausible that a child might sit for a moment before playing, it is not an immediate prerequisite for play. 3. \\"Being entertained\\": This phrase suggests that the child is passively receiving entertainment, rather than actively participating in an activity like playing with a friend. Moreover, the notion of being entertained before playing does not directly convey an action or interaction with a friend that would lead to playtime. 4. \\"Math\\": While math can be a fun and engaging educational activity, it is not typically considered as a precursor to playing with a friend. In this context, math would seemingly be an unrelated activity that might be done independently or in a school setting. In summary, \\"meet\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it directly represents the necessary initial interaction between two friends before they can embark on any shared activities, like playing. The other options, though potentially related to a child's experiences, do not logically precede a play session or directly involve interactions with a friend in the same way that meeting does."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She's actually helping to keep this community safe.\\" I furrowed my brow, wondering how she was accomplishing that admirable feat through her seemingly harmless hobby. As curiosity whispered in the back of my mind, I replied, \\"I don't doubt her intentions, but how exactly is listening to a police scanner a productive way to spend her time, let alone help our community?\\" Skylar leaned back on his chair and crossed his arms, a half-smirk emerging on his face. \\"Well, since you asked, Genevieve has been using the scanner to identify crime patterns in certain areas and to keep an ear on police responses to emergencies. She then shares this information with a team of local volunteers who provide extra support to the neighborhoods facing a higher prevalence of crime. This way, they're better prepared to report anything suspicious and deter potential criminals from conducting their activities in the area.\\" My skepticism began to dissipate as Skylar continued to explain the reasons behind Genevieve's unique hobby. I could see that it had real-world, practical effects. But, as with any unregulated initiative, concerns about possible misuse and lack of oversight lurked in my mind. Taking a deep breath, I asked, \\"That sounds like an incredible initiative, but what's stopping Genevieve or anyone else on her team from using this information for their own personal gain or advantage? How is this operation being regulated?\\" Skylar's smirk softened as he acknowledged my concerns. \\"Fair point. Honestly, we're relying on a combination of personal integrity and mutual accountability among the team members,\\" he paused, looking thoughtful for a moment. \\"If any team member is suspected of abusing their knowledge or position, they'll be investigated and subsequently removed from the group if necessary. We're constantly working on refining this process, but for now, our primary aim is to create an environment where everyone feels motivated to work together for the greater good of our community.\\" As I listened to Skylar's response, I gained new respect for Genevieve and her team. They had managed to transform a seemingly innocuous hobby into a force for positive change in the community. After learning more about the ethical safeguards in place, I couldn't help but feel humbled by their voluntary efforts. I nodded, understanding the complicated dynamics of the situation. \\"I suppose it's impressive how ordinary people are utilizing their skills and interests in creating a safer environment for everyone. Though there's always room for improvement, it's essential to appreciate and support their endeavors.\\" Skylar smiled genuinely, glad to see my viewpoint had shifted. \\"Exactly. No initiative is perfect, but as long as we remain open to constructive criticism and adapt accordingly, we'll continue to make a difference.\\" We continued our conversation, delving deeper into the intricacies of community-driven programs and the power of collective effort. As we talked, I felt proud to be part of a community where individuals were willing to dedicate their time and energy to protect and improve the lives of those around them, proving that even hobbies could have a significant impact on the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\").

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The centenary of the birth of William Faulkner, one of the great modern novelists, was celebrated in September 1997. Faulkner wrote about the southern states of the United States of America where he grew up, and where his family had an important part to play in the history of that region. His work became a touchstone for insights into the troubled issues of southern American identity, race relations, and the family interrelationships of the old time southern gentry . Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi on September 25, 1897. Despite his interest in writing, he left Oxford High School, Mississippi, without graduating. After World War I, he entered the University of Mississippi as a special student, a right to study which was granted to retired soldiers, although Faulkner had only finished training with the Air Force in Canada, and not entered combat . Faulkner began to write poems, a verse play, short stories and finished his first novel Sartoris in 1928.

When he accepted it in Stockholm, his speech emphasized that he wished to continue writing, but in a positive way that affirmed the power of humanity to prevail over adverse circumstances. As he said in his speech, he still felt that, despite the threat of nuclear war then hanging over the world, the central concern of the writer should be \\"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself\\".

Please answer the following question: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: why does Trump continue tweeting? Options: - not enough information - he has a large ego - he thinks it is helping. - he thinks he is witty Answer:","completion":"- not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since 2001, the band's line-up has included vocalist and rhythm guitarist Duff McKagan (Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses), lead guitarist Mike Squires (formerly of Nevada Bachelors and Alien Crime Syndicate) and bassist Jeff Rouse (formerly of Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister, and Vendetta Red). Since 2009, Isaac Carpenter (formerly of Loudermilk, Gosling, and The Exies) has been the band's drummer, replacing Geoff Reading (formerly of New American Shame and Green Apple Quick Step). McKagan first formed Loaded to be his touring band in support of his unreleased solo album Beautiful Disease. Context: Duff McKagan was previously a member of Guns N' Roses from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. Guns N' Roses achieved international success, going on to sell over 100 million albums worldwide, but the strain between singer Axl Rose and the rest of the band led to a number of members leaving or being fired, with McKagan departing in 1997. McKagan moved back to Seattle, reforming previous group 10 Minute Warning, releasing one self-titled album on Sub Pop in 1998, before recording his second solo album Beautiful Disease the same year. Featuring collaborations with former Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin, former Black Flag singer Dez Cadena and his former Guns N' Roses band mates Slash and Izzy Stradlin, Beautiful Disease was scheduled to be released through Geffen in 1999. McKagan formed Loaded, initially as The Gentlemen, to be his band for the tour supporting the album. With McKagan performing lead vocals and bass duties, Loaded's line-up consisted of guitarists Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan as well as drummer Taz Bentley. McKagan began promoting the album; however, following the merger between Geffen and Interscope Records, he was dropped from the label and lost all commercial rights to release the record with only a few promo copies being leaked. Loaded continued to tour and released a live album, Episode 1999: Live, independently, which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz. They re-recorded half of Beautiful Disease and received offers from four labels. However, they disbanded before the end of the year, with McKagan and Bentley becoming part of Izzy Stradlin's rhythm section for his tour of Japan supporting Ride On. Question: What did McKagan do after putting out the solo album? Answer:","completion":"After recording his second solo album, Beautiful Disease, in 1998, Duff McKagan faced a significant setback when the planned release through Geffen Records was canceled due to a merger between Geffen and Interscope Records. As a result, McKagan lost all commercial rights to release the record, and only a few promo copies were leaked. Despite this setback, McKagan formed Loaded (originally known as The Gentlemen) as his touring band to support his solo efforts. Loaded's initial lineup consisted of Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan on guitars, Taz Bentley on drums, and McKagan on lead vocals and bass. Loaded continued to tour and eventually released a live album independently titled Episode 1999: Live, which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz. Seeking to move forward, Loaded re-recorded half of the Beautiful Disease tracks and received offers from four labels. However, before any progress could be made, the band disbanded by the end of that year. Following Loaded's disbandment, McKagan and Bentley joined former Guns N' Roses bandmate Izzy Stradlin's rhythm section for his tour of Japan, supporting Stradlin's album Ride On. Although the release of Beautiful Disease was thwarted, McKagan remained active in the music industry, persistently pursuing new projects and collaborations with other musicians. His efforts with Loaded, subsequent collaboration with Stradlin, and ongoing contributions within the rock music scene underscore his dedication and resilience as an artist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter. A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter.

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) ripped his colleagues during a tour of northeast Oklahoma, calling them “career elitists,” “cowards” and said, “It’s just a good thing I can’t pack a gun on the Senate floor.” Coburn’s gun-on-the-floor comment comes less than a month after Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) made a triumphant return to the Capitol and the House floor following an assassination attempt in January outside a Tucson supermarket. Text Size - + reset POLITICO 44 At the time of the shooting, in which six people were killed, there were calls for re-instituting the federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips and beefing up protection for members of Congress. None of the proposals gained significant traction since. Coburn spokesman John Hart sought to walk back the comments. “Dr. Coburn was obviously joking and would be happy to personally apologize to any of his colleagues who were offended,” Hart told CBS NEWS. “That said, his frustration with a Congress that has inflicted severe economic damage on the country is well-known and well-founded. Fortunately, actions speak louder than words. Few have done more to try to bridge the divide in Congress and come up with a solution than Dr. Coburn.” Hart declined to speak with POLITICO. Coburn’s remarks on Wednesday, reported by the Tulsa World, represent a tour de force of conservative thought. He said the nation’s health care system was better before Medicare existed, even as he noted that some people received poor care at the time and doctors often accepted baked goods or chickens in partial payment. “You can’t tell me the system is better now than it was before Medicare,” he said. He told a group at the Integris Mayes County Medical Center in Pryor, Okla.: “Show me where in the Constitution the federal government is responsible for your health care?” Without specifying what he meant, Coburn said President Barack Obama has an “intent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him.” The World’s caption below a photo of Coburn reads the understated: “Disagrees with Obama’s politics.” “As an African-American male,” Coburn said, Obama received “tremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.” The programs were not identified in the World report. Coburn, a friend of Obama’s from their shared time in the Senate, added that Congress is to blame for most of the nation’s problems. “I don’t think presidents matter that much,” he said. The chickens remark harkens to the 2010 Nevada GOP Senate primary, when then-front-runner Sue Lowden proposed paying a health care barter system that would include paying physicians with chickens. Lowden lost the primary to Sharron Angle, who then lost the general election to Sen. Harry Reid. ||||| A story just moved in the Tulsa World that has the Senator saying some odd things about Medicare and then some kinda unfortunate things about President Obama. First, back to the future with Chicken Care … “You can’t tell me the system is better now than it was before Medicare,” he said. Coburn agreed that some people received poor care - or no care - before Medicare was enacted in the 1960s, but said communities worked together to make sure most people received needed medical attention. He also conceded that doctors and hospitals often went unpaid for their efforts, or accepted baked goods or chickens in partial payment. Coburn then rejected one townhall attendee’s suggestion that President Obama wanted to destroy America but suggested that he wanted to create a culture of dependency because dependency worked out so well for him. Responding to a man in Langley who asked if Obama “wants to destroy America,” Coburn said the president is “very bright” and loves his country but has a political philosophy that is “goofy and wrong.” Obama’s “intent is not to destroy, his intent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him,” he said. “As an African-American male,” Coburn said, Obama received “tremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.” ||||| Sen. Coburn: It's a 'good thing I can't pack a gun on the Senate floor' By Josiah Ryan - Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) criticized his congressional colleagues Tuesday, calling them \\"cowards\\" and a \\"class of career elitists.\\" \\"It's just a good thing I can't pack a gun on the Senate floor,\\" Coburn told a crowd in Langley, Okla., as reported in Wednesday's Tulsa World. The two-term senator, who has earned the nickname \\"Dr. No\\" for his frequent holds on legislation, has never been one to mince words. But his comments about carrying a gun come after the January assignation attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who returned to Congress for the first time a few weeks ago in order to vote on a deal to raise the debt ceiling. He did add that most members of Congress are good people with good intentions, according to the Tulsa World report. Coburn recently reaffirmed his pledge to only serve two terms, saying he would retire when his term is up in 2016. Despite their political differences, the conservative senator is good friends with President Obama, whom he defended during one exchange with voters back in Oklahoma. He said the president's \\"intent is not to destroy\\" but to create a dependency on the government, in part because of his experience growing up as a minority in America. \\"His intent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him,” he said. \\"As an African-American male,\\" Coburn said, Obama received \\"tremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.\\" He also joined Obama in blaming the country's problems on Congress, adding that \\"I don't think presidents matter that much.\\" The senator, a member of the bipartisan \\"Gang of Six,\\", said he hopes the new supercommittee created to cut government spending will be successful, but added that he's not optimistic.

Will my USAMO Qualification help me get into Wharton Business School for undergrad? How do you prove the existent equivalence between The Integral and The Anti-Derivative? Select from the following. *no *yes The answer is:","completion":"no The two questions you provided are not the same. They are related to different subjects and ask for different types of information. Here is an explanation for each question: 1. \\"Will my USAMO Qualification help me get into Wharton Business School for undergrad?\\" This question is about educational qualifications and target students who are interested in pursuing an undergraduate degree at the Wharton Business School, which is part of the University of Pennsylvania. The USAMO (United States of America Mathematical Olympiad) is a prestigious high school mathematics competition and showcases exceptional problem-solving abilities. While USAMO qualification demonstrates exceptional academic achievement and may be a valued accomplishment on a college application, it is important to understand that Wharton Business School considers a variety of factors when reviewing applicants for undergraduate admission. These factors may include academic achievement, extracurricular activities, leadership experiences, letters of recommendation, and personal qualities, among others. Although USAMO qualification may be an advantageous aspect of your application, it is not the sole determinant for admission to Wharton Business School. 2. \\"How do you prove the existent equivalence between The Integral and The Anti-Derivative?\\" This question is related to the field of mathematics, specifically calculus. It seeks to learn about the relationship between two fundamental concepts: integration and antiderivatives. The integral and the antiderivative are two closely related concepts in calculus. The fundamental theorem of calculus, which consists of two parts, provides the connection between differentiation and integration. According to the theorem, the antiderivative can be used to evaluate definite integrals. In other words, if you take the antiderivative of a function and evaluate the result between the definite integral's upper and lower limits, you can obtain the integral's value. To prove the equivalence between the integral and the antiderivative, one can use the fundamental theorem of calculus. Here is a brief explanation: Part 1 of the fundamental theorem of calculus states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and has an antiderivative F on that interval, then the definite integral of the function over the interval [a, b] is equal to the difference between the values of the antiderivative F at the endpoints b and a: ∫[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a), where F'(x) = f(x). Part 2 of the fundamental theorem of calculus states that if a function is continuous on an open interval containing a, then the derivative of the integral of the function with respect to x, with limits of integration from a to x, is equal to the value of the function at x: d/dx [∫[a, x] f(t) dt] = f(x). These two parts of the fundamental theorem of calculus illustrate the connection between the integral and the antiderivative and effectively establish their equivalence.

This is because the response will possibly involve an identifiable group or culture of people, likely to be ancient civilization or specific indigenous groups, who first carried out the process of domestication. The answer isn't an abbreviation or description, as it's looking for a specific identifier, not an abbreviation or a more detailed description. It's also not specifically a human because it's more likely a group or civilization rather than an individual who performed the domestication. It wouldn't be a location, while the location of where this domestication happened might be interesting, it's not the answer to the \\"who\\". Finally, a numeric value wouldn't make sense in this context as the question isn't asking for a quantity or a date.

While both sentences do share similarities in terms of discussing family members who are art historians, their structure and naming patterns have led to a difference in the family relationships mentioned.

A. Richter. - All the three individuals mentioned (Luise Marie Schwaab, Irma, and Gisela M. A. Richter) are art historians. Sentence 2: - The subject, \\"His wife,\\" is Gisela M. A. Richter. - The subject has two daughters named Irma and Luise Marie Schwaab. - All the three individuals mentioned (Gisela M. A. Richter, Irma, and Luise Marie Schwaab) are art historians. The key difference between the two sentences is the identity of \\"His wife.\\" In Sentence 1, the wife is Luise Marie Schwaab, and Gisela M. A. Richter is identified as a daughter.

Context: As many of you will have seen, unfortunately the Ubuntu Edge campaign did not reach our goal of 32million. The final total reached was 12,812,776. I am hugely proud and thankful to everyone who pledged, supported the campaign, wrote about it, and helped to spread the word. Some have described us not meeting the goal as a “failure”. I don’t see it that way. Let’s be honest: 32million was always an incredibly ambitious target. We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn’t come cheap (and remember that the 32million didn’t include any costs for software engineering and project management…Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though. I am not surprised that we didn’t hit this ambitious 32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more. Every single person who put their support into the Ubuntu Edge campaign should be proud of their achievements and we are all thankful for your tremendous and inspiring support. One thing to be critically clear about is that the Ubuntu convergence story does not end here. We are as voraciously excited and committed to bringing this Free Software convergence story to the world as ever before; our work with OEMs, Carriers, and ISVs continues apace. We have fantastic work going on across all fronts, and we are on track to have a 1.0 release of the Ubuntu Phone platform in October.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Question: What can we learn from the conversation? - The woman often eats out for breakfast. - The cafeteria serves good breakfast. - The woman doesn't have breakfast. The answer is:","completion":"From the conversation, we can learn that the woman doesn't have breakfast. The man asked the woman if she has her break (breakfast), lunch, and dinner at the cafeteria. The woman replied that she has lunch and dinner there but always skips breakfast. This indicates that the woman does not have breakfast, either at the cafeteria or elsewhere. We cannot conclude that the woman often eats out for breakfast or that the cafeteria serves good breakfast, as there is no information provided in the conversation to support these assumptions. The only information that can be drawn from the conversation is the woman's habit of skipping breakfast, which is the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who first commissioned the dredging of a canal, and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring, which created Big Spring Lake? ? Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Please answer the following question: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions. That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment. This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases: \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger) The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. What is the direct reason for the polar bear to become endangered? A) It is that the floating ice upon which they survive melts away. B) It is that more greenhouse gases have been sent out.

Write an article based on this \\"Choose non-comedogenic skincare products. Wash and moisturize your hair before you wash your back. Buy a clay or charcoal mask product. Apply a mask product to your back once a week. Keep your skin clean and dry throughout the day.\\"","completion":"Title: Taking Care of Your Back: Non-Comedogenic Skincare Products and Tips Introduction Skincare should not only be limited to your face but also extend to the entire body, particularly your back. Back acne can be an unpleasant experience, causing discomfort and affecting your self-confidence. To maintain healthy skin and prevent blemishes on your back, it is essential to follow a proper skincare routine that involves choosing the right products and adopting the correct techniques. In this article, we discuss how you can care for your back using non-comedogenic skincare products and following an effective routine. 1. Choose Non-Comedogenic Skincare Products Non-comedogenic products are vital in maintaining healthy skin on any part of your body, as they are formulated to reduce the risk of clogged pores – the leading cause of acne. Specifically designed not to contribute to the formation of pimples and blemishes, non-comedogenic skincare products have become a popular choice for those with acne-prone skin. By opting for non-comedogenic body washes, lotions, and cleansers, you can keep your back clear from breakouts. 2. Wash and Moisturize Your Hair before Washing Your Back During your shower routine, it is advisable to wash and moisturize your hair before cleansing your back. This step is crucial as hair care products like shampoos, conditioners, and styling agents can leave residues that may clog the pores on your back. By washing your hair first, you can ensure that any remnants are rinsed away when you clean your back. Additionally, this step helps prevent the spread of oil from your hair onto your back, which can also cause blemishes. 3. Invest in Clay or Charcoal Mask Products Clay and charcoal masks are widely known for their detoxifying and absorptive properties. They have the ability to draw out impurities and excess oil from the skin, reducing the likelihood of breakouts. Including a clay or charcoal mask in your back skincare routine once a week can significantly improve your skin's overall health and prevent blemishes. These masks are highly recommended for those prone to back acne, as regular use can lead to noticeable improvements in skin clarity and texture. 4. Apply a Mask Product to Your Back Once a Week Setting aside time once a week to apply a clay or charcoal mask to your back will help in maintaining healthy skin. To do so, ensure your back is clean and dry before applying the mask evenly. Allow the mask to dry for approximately 10-15 minutes, or as instructed by the product's guidelines. Rinse off the mask thoroughly with warm water, followed by a gentle body wash to remove any remaining traces. This process will help keep your back clean and clear of acne-causing impurities. 5. Keep Your Skin Clean and Dry Throughout the Day Maintaining good hygiene and keeping your skin clean and dry during the day is essential in preventing breakouts. Daily activities like exercising, sweating, and wearing tight or unbreathable clothing can contribute to increased moisture and bacteria growth on your skin, causing breakouts. Opt for loose, breathable clothing made of natural fibers like cotton to avoid irritation and allow your skin to breathe. Additionally, shower immediately after exercising and pat your skin dry to reduce the buildup of sweat and bacteria on your back. Conclusion By incorporating non-comedogenic skincare products and a mindful routine, you can significantly improve the health of your back's skin and prevent blemishes. Pay close attention to the order in which you cleanse your body, the type of mask, you use, and your daily habits to enjoy cleaner, clearer skin on your back. Remember that consistency is key, and a dedicated approach to skincare will help yield the best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. Question: \\"What is the name of NASA's successor to the retired 2011 space shuttle program?\\" Response: \\"Orion\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

Possible answers: she hated cookies, she loved baking, she hated baking The answer is:","completion":"Robin baked cookies all day in her new bakery most likely because she loved baking. This conclusion is reached by assessing the given situation and alternative answers provided. A detailed examination of the information provided explains this further. When a person opens a bakery, it is often because they have a passion for the craft of baking. If Robin did not enjoy baking, she would likely not have invested time, energy, and capital into establishing her own bakery. Furthermore, it is also noted that Robin baked cookies all day long, which additionally indicates an enthusiasm for baking as it requires time, patience, and effort, which seems unlikely to be found in a person who dislikes the process. Among the possible answers suggested were also the options that she hated cookies and she hated baking. These seem illogical and contradictory considering the context given. If Robin hated cookies, it wouldn't be in her interest to spend an entire day creating something she dislikes. Similarly, if she hated baking, it is highly unlikely that she would establish a bakery and then further spend an entire day indulged in an activity she despises. Lastly, opening a bakery indicates not only Robin’s passion for baking but also her desire to share her creations with others. Sharing food— especially something universally loved like cookies— brings joy to people and that might provide additional motivation for Robin to bake cookies all day. In conclusion, the most plausible answer to the question 'Why did Robin bake cookies all day in her new bakery?' is that she loved baking. The love for baking combined with the satisfaction derived from sharing the fruits of her craft with others would motivate her to invest long hours into creating cookies. The other possibilities proposed seem to contradict the given context, making them less likely scenarios."},{"prompt":"Who was the vice president during george w bush?

People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists. and a hint : Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Please answer this question : Which village had more people with enhanced health? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, the people from Sand village, who consumed iodized salt, had more people with enhanced health. Step 1: Understand the difference between regular salt and iodized salt. - Regular salt is simply sodium chloride without any additional minerals. - Iodized salt is sodium chloride that has been fortified with the mineral iodine, which is essential for human health. Step 2: Consider the hint provided. - The hint states that before the introduction of iodized salt, some people experienced developmental difficulties, thyroid gland function problems, and mental retardation. - These issues could be treated with the addition of iodide anion to the diet, which was achieved by adding iodine to table salt. Step 3: Analyze the effects on health. - Iodized salt helps prevent iodine deficiency, thus aiding in the normal functioning of the thyroid gland, supporting brain development, and promoting overall health. - Regular salt doesn't provide these additional health benefits. Step 4: Compare the health of the two villages. - The people in Salt village consumed regular salt, which did not provide the benefits of iodine. - The people in Sand village consumed iodized salt, which contained the necessary iodide anion to enhance their health and development. Conclusion: Due to the intake of iodized salt, the people of Sand village had more enhanced health compared to those in Salt village, who consumed regular salt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is As this \\"orange peel\\" originates in the master rather than being introduced in the pressing stage, there is no ill effect as there is no physical distortion of the groove. a good answer to this question? Select from: a). yes. b). no.","completion":"b). no. Using worn molds when casting records can have multiple effects on the quality and performance of the final product. The provided answer focuses on the \\"orange peel\\" effect, which is not a direct result of worn molds but rather originates in the master. Therefore, it does not address the specific question about the effects of worn molds. A more detailed and accurate answer to the question would be: Worn molds can have a negative impact on the quality of records produced through the casting process. Over time, the surface of the mold can deteriorate and develop imperfections due to the wear and tear of frequent use. This can lead to various issues in the finished records, including some of the following: 1. Distortion in the grooves: The grooves on a record are essential for accurate sound reproduction. As a mold wears down, the grooves may become distorted or irregular, causing disruptions to the audio quality. This can result in sound artifacts, inconsistent volume levels, or skipping during playback. 2. Warping: The overall shape and flatness of the record can be compromised by a worn mold. This could cause the record to become warped, which can adversely affect playback on a turntable, making the record skip or have unstable tracking. 3. Surface noise: Imperfections in the mold can introduce surface noise in the finished record. This is manifested as a constant background hissing, crackling, or popping sound during playback, which can severely diminish the listening experience. 4. Poor material bonding: Records are produced by pressing hot vinyl into a mold. Worn molds may cause poor bonding between the vinyl layers, leading to potential delamination or separation of the layers over time. This can cause the record to become unusable or structurally unsound. To ensure high-quality records, it is crucial to maintain and replace molds regularly to avoid the issues caused by using worn molds. Record pressing plants should implement quality control measures such as regular mold inspections and replacements to ensure the production of superior vinyl records."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time.

For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it.

Summarize: Transport Minister Edwina Hart has confirmed Arriva Trains Wales and Network Rail have broadly agreed with an independent report recommending opening a station at Carno in Powys. Local people have been campaigning for the move since 2002. The station shut in 1963 as part of the Beeching cuts to Britain's railways. In a letter to Montgomeryshire AM Russell George, Mrs Hart said she had asked officials at Arriva Trains Wales and Network Rail to undertake analysis. \\"I have now received a letter from Arriva Trains Wales and Network Rail. They broadly accept the specialist's conclusions but express concern that additional stops might impact on performance and punctuality,\\" she wrote. \\"They have offered to assist my officials with further technical analysis to identify solutions to any issues and I have requested that this should be completed for further review by February.\\" Mr George has has long supported the campaign for the station and said it was a \\"positive step forward\\". There have been concerns that re-opening the station would impact on the railway's timetable and cause journeys to be longer, due to the stop, but campaigners say this would be minimal. Carno Station Action Group chairman, Jeremy Barnes said: \\"At most, stopping at Carno would add three minutes on to the passengers' journey. \\"This part of Wales is neglected when it comes to rail services. It is located on the longest stretch of railway without an intermediate station in the whole of Wales, the 22 miles [35km] between Caersws and Machynlleth.\\" The original station closed in 1963. Even though the Cambrian railway survived, this was one of the stations that closed along the line. It became part of the Laura Ashley site in Carno, which closed in 2004.","completion":"So the person who makes sure we follow the rules for trains, Mrs. Hart, is saying that some train companies agree with an idea to open a train station in a place called Carno. Local people have wanted this since 2002 because the old station closed in 1963. But, the train companies are a bit worried that stopping at this new station might make trains late because it adds more time to the trip. Mrs. Hart will keep checking to make sure it's a good idea and plans to have more information by February. Mr. George, another person who makes rules, is really happy about this. People think that the extra stop won't take too much time, maybe just three more minutes. Right now, there's a long piece of train track between two towns without any stop in between, so they feel a little left out. This station used to be part of something else, a place called Laura Ashley, but that closed in 2004."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When people have guests over, they often perform activities that create a welcoming atmosphere and foster a sense of community and togetherness. Among the given choices, \\"cook food\\" and \\"share food\\" are closely related to this goal. In many cultures, sharing a meal is a universal symbol of hospitality and a way to bring people together. When hosting guests, people often cook food as a gesture of care and warmth, preparing dishes that the guests may enjoy while ensuring that their needs and preferences are taken into consideration. Sharing food not only provides sustenance, but also facilitates conversation and bonding, further solidifying the choice. While \\"talk to each other\\" and \\"learn from each other\\" are activities that can occur during gatherings, they are not necessarily specific to hosting guests. \\"Demand justice\\" is an outlier in this context, as it is not a common activity performed while entertaining.

The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement. The takedown is the latest example of how companies like GoDaddy are increasingly responding to growing public pressure to clamp down on violent sites in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer. GoDaddy, which registers domains for more than 75 million websites around the world, said it generally does not delist sites that promote hate, racism and bigotry on the ground that such content is protected as free speech.

In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The things you say to the guy, or even the things you talk about when you're not around the guy, can be a big indication of whether or not you have a crush on the guy. Here's how to know if the things you say mean that you have a serious crush: If you find yourself always teasing the guy. If you always end up poking fun at the guy without meaning to, it means you have a crush. If you talk really fast or stutter when you say anything to the guy, it means you have a crush. If you're careful about not saying anything that might make you look like a ditz or dumb in front of the guy, then you have a crush. And if you feel like everything you say to him does make you sound like a ditz, then you probably have a crush. If you can't talk to one of your friends for more than ten minutes without mentioning the guy, then you have a crush. If you have a crush, your friends may be able to pick up on it before you do. You can learn a lot about whether or not you have a crush on the guy based on how you act around him, or even how you act when he's miles away. Here are a few ways to know if your actions mean you've been bitten by the crush bug: If you go out of your way to hang out with him, then you have a crush on him. If you've never watched baseball in your life but are suddenly going to all the school games because you know he'll be sitting in the bleachers, then you have a crush. If you want to be near him whenever you do hang out. If you find yourself drifting toward him when you're in a group of friends, or even touching him in a playful way whenever you can, then you have a crush. If you can't stand being around him when he's flirting with other girls, then you have a crush. If your heart falls when you show up to a place where you thought he'd be and he isn't there, then you have a crush. It may not be a coincidence that you're suddenly spending twice as much time in front of the mirror whenever you know you'll see the guy. Here's how to know if your grooming habits and attention to your looks say that you have a crush on the guy: If you try twice as hard to look good if you know you'll see him. If you wear your best outfit, best hairdo, and most amazing eye makeup when you know he'll be there, then you have a crush. If you find yourself experimenting with new makeup looks or jewelry to see if he notices, then you have a crush. If you find yourself not caring at all about how you look if you go somewhere where you know you won't see him, then you have a crush. Let's say this guy is the athletic, typical-boy type.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The process of fossilization involves a series of events that begins with the death of an organism and eventually leads to the formation of a fossil. Let's first briefly review the sequence of steps that normally occurs in the formation of a fossil: 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts. 4. The remaining parts are replaced with minerals over the years. 5. A fossil is formed. Now, let us consider the hypothetical situation where more sediment builds up over the remains. This additional sediment can have various effects on the fossilization process, particularly on the decomposition of the remains and the subsequent mineral replacement. When more sediment accumulates on top of the remains, it can create a more stable and less oxygen-rich environment. This could slow down the rate of decomposition, making it less likely for the remains to decompose rapidly. As a result, the trace amounts of the organism's original material might persist for a longer duration before being replaced by minerals in the process of fossilization. This would mean that it could take longer for the fossil to form, but the overall quality and preservation of the fossil might be improved due to less decomposition prior to mineral replacement. In this case, the second effect – the remains decomposing and leaving only trace amounts – would be influenced by the increased sediment buildup. The decomposition process would likely be slowed down, allowing for better preservation of the remains' structures and increasing the potential for more accurate fossilization. To summarize, the supposed perturbation of more sediment building up over the remains would have a \\"less\\" effect on the decomposition of the remains. This means that the remains would decompose at a slower rate, possibly leading to improved fossil preservation, but it might also prolong the overall fossilization process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The cities they live in have very similar environments with the only difference being that the CO2 levels in Jerry's town are elevated, and in Gary's they are not. Jerry and Gary regularly talk on the phone and compare notes with each other since their farms are so similar.

Hint: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants.

Last updated at 8:38 AM on 12th January 2012. Dangerous games: Sgt Matthew Gallagher, 22, died of a gunshot to the head on an army base in Iraq. A soldier, who died after a colleague allegedly shot him at point-blank range during a game of 'quick draw', was warned not to play the game two days before. Sergeant Matthew Gallagher, 22, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head while serving at his base in Al-Kut, Iraq on June 26 last year. Sgt Brent McBride, 25, was initially charged with murder over the death of Sgt Gallagher from Falmouth, Massachussetts. However following a hearing in Texas last month no further legal proceedings were set for McBride, an army source told msnbc.com, but the military would carry out its own investigation. Sgt Gallagher's widow Katie, 23, and his mother Cheryl Ruggiero spoke for the first time this week to the Boston Globe about the investigation in December - and had many unanswered questions. In the weeks following his death, his wife. and mother came to believe he had died in action. Reports from the investigation in Texas. last month said that Sgt Gallagher pointed his gun at Sgt McBride, saying: 'What would you do now?' It is then believed that McBride drew his own gun and pointed it at Gallagher’s head before firing the fatal shot. The lawyer for McBride said at the time. it was a 'tragic accident', and he did not know the 9mm pistol came to be loaded,. according to the Cape Cod Times. Mrs Ruggerio, 53, who is suspicious of McBride's account, told the Boston Globe: 'He did take someone’s life. You can say. it was a horrible accident, but he knew, as a soldier, with his. training, it’s not something you do. You don’t pick up a gun and put it. to someone’s head.’ Demanding answers: Sgt Gallagher's widow, Katie, 23, and mother Cheryl Ruggiero, from Falmouth, Massachussets still have questions about their loved one's death. McBride was initially charged with. murder but an Army spokesman at Fort Hood, Texas, told msnbc.com that no. further legal proceedings are set 'pending a review' by the Army. It is. not clear whether the soldier will be court-martialled. Sources said that several soldiers and at least one higher-ranking staff sergeant warned them against playing the game. The death of 22-year-old Sgt Gallagher remains under investigation. Meanwhile, McBride remains on active duty at Fort Hood, according to the Cape Cod Times.

The Buffalo Bills have agreed to pay up to 3 million – largely in the form of debit cards redeemable only at the team store – to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the team of sending too many alerts to fans who signed up for a text-messaging service. Jerry Wojcik, a Bills fan and area native now living in Florida, contended in his October 2012 suit that the team violated the terms of its text service by sending him 13 messages over two weeks when it promised to send no more than five per week. The lawsuit was panned as frivolous by some sports fans, media commentators and legal experts. But in a settlement filed last week in federal court in Tampa, Fla., the Bills agreed to provide up to 2.5 million in debit cards to people who had signed up for the text service, along with 562,500 to Wojcik’s lawyers and 5,000 in cash to Wojcik as class representative. The estimated value of the debit cards that will be issued to class members who received more than five alerts in a given week is 2,487,745. The cards can be used at the Bills store at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park or online at the team’s website. They can’t be redeemed for cash. The debit cards are worth 57.50, 65 or 75, depending on which class tier a fan is assigned to, and the Bills said in a legal filing that an estimated 39,750 phone numbers had been registered through the now-defunct text-messaging service. A motion that accompanied the settlement order argued that the offer of Bills debit cards was an appropriate form of settlement because the class consists of Bills fans. “The Buffalo Bills have reached a settlement in this matter which we believe is in the best interest of our organization and our fans. The purpose of the Bills’ voluntary, opt-in text messaging program was to provide our fans with information they requested about the team. The organization maintains that our text messaging program was in compliance with the law,” Bills spokesman Scott Berchtold said in a statement Monday. Under the terms of the settlement, the Bills promise to put in place “safeguards” to ensure any new service abides by limits set by the team on the number of messages. Wojcik declined to comment when reached by The Buffalo News on Monday afternoon, citing his belief that he was unfairly criticized in local and national media after filing the suit, and referred a reporter to his attorneys. “(The) plaintiff is pleased the court granted preliminary approval of the class settlement, which was only reached after substantial negotiations with the court-appointed mediator,” one of Wojcik’s attorneys, Keith J. Keogh of Chicago, said in an email. He declined to comment further. Wojcik also was represented by lawyers James S. Giardina, of Tampa, and Scott D. Owens, of Hallandale, Fla. A big Bills fan, Wojcik in September 2012 signed up for mobile text alerts from the team after visiting its website, according to his original lawsuit. Language on the website promised fans who enrolled in the messaging service would receive three to five messages per week for 12 months. Wojcik, however, said he received six messages during his second week in the program and seven messages during a later, one-week period. He claimed in his suit that the extra texts violated the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and he sought statutory damages of 500 per excessive message for negligent violations and up to 1,500 per message for willful violations. The settlement that received preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Steven D. Merryday followed years of “hard-fought and often-times contentious” litigation, according to the settlement motion. A final hearing in the case is set for Aug. 20. Buffalo attorney Jeffrey F. Reina and Tampa attorney Janelle A. Weber represented the team in the suit. Once the deal receives final approval, an administrator will use a reverse-directory to send notices and claim forms by mail to the owners of the phone numbers registered for the messaging service. The administrator also will set up a website offering details on the settlement. email: swatson@buffnews.com ||||| NFL free agency can be pricey, and that’s before you factor in the cost of keeping fans abreast of the latest news regarding their favorite teams.

Problem:Embryonic-like stem cells (ELSCs) express embryonic stem cell-specific marker genes, such as SSEA-4, Oct-4 and Nanog, and can be induced to differentiate into cells of all 3 germ layers. Our preliminary data showed that ELSCs isolated from human bone marrow express multipotent antigen markers and differentiate into multinucleated myotube-like cells more efficiently than do mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from the same source. We investigated the therapeutic effect of ELSCs in dystrophin/utrophin double knock-out (dko) mice, one of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy animal models, by systemically transplanting them through tail-vein injection.', 'ELSCs and MSCs were both isolated from human bone marrow. Two months after equal amounts of ELSCs or MSCs were injected through tail-vein injection, we evaluated skeletal muscle motor function and serum creatine kinase activity and measured dystrophin expression by means of immunostaining, Western blotting and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.', 'ELSCs positive for Oct-4 and Nanog-3 expressed higher levels of SSEA-4, FZD-9 and CD105 and were induced to differentiate into myotube-like cells more efficiently than did MSCs in vitro.

In my opinion, that is included in the compromise. In this statement, the speaker is expressing their belief that a particular element or aspect is an integral part of something, specifically within a compromise. A compromise generally involves two or more parties coming to an agreement by making concessions or finding middle ground. By stating that this particular aspect is directly related or necessary to the compromise, the speaker is emphasizing its importance and arguing that it should not be overlooked or separated from the main agreement. For example, if two people are discussing the terms of a shared living arrangement, one person may feel that a certain responsibility should be divided equally between both parties. In this case, they could use this phrase to express that the responsibility cannot be separated from the main agreement, as it is directly connected to the compromise being made. The speaker also clarifies that in their opinion, this aspect is already included or considered as part of the compromise. This can mean that they believe the element has been accounted for and should not be further negotiated or debated. In a way, they are emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and accepting this aspect as part of the agreement, rather than trying to remove or exclude it.

Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Measuring instrument (pull and length) for auto trawling","completion":"The process of removing spaces from a given sentence involves identifying individual words based on spaces and putting them together directly, eliminating the spaces. Given the sentence \\"Measuring instrument (pull and length) for auto trawling\\", by removing the spaces, it becomes: \\"Measuringinstrument(pullandlength)forautotrawling\\" Here's how it works: each word or group of words separated by a space is identified – \\"Measuring\\", \\"instrument\\", \\"(pull\\", \\"and\\", \\"length)\\", \\"for\\", \\"auto\\", \\"trawling\\". They are then combined directly together without spaces between them. Therefore, we get the resulting sentence with zero spaces. It's essential to note that, in this case, the parenthesis encompassing \\"pull and length\\" won't cause any problems or confusion, as the included terms are also adhering to the no-space rule—forming \\"pullandlength\\". Since there are no spaces, each individual word might be harder to identify at first glance, but the sentence itself retains the same information as before, just formatted differently.

To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which forest would get more insolation, forest A or forest B?","completion":"Based on the information provided, forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would receive more insolation than forest B, the temperate forest in Germany. Insolation refers to the amount of incoming solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, and it is an important factor in determining climate and plant communities. There are several reasons why forest A would receive more insolation than forest B: 1. Latitude: Forest A is located in Brazil, which is closer to the equator, while forest B is located in Germany, which is situated at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Areas near the equator receive more insolation throughout the year due to the direct angle of sunlight reaching the surface. In contrast, higher latitude regions receive sunlight at a less direct angle, leading to a lower level of insolation. 2. Climate: Since forest A is a tropical rainforest, it belongs to a region with a consistently warm and moist climate. High levels of insolation, combined with ample precipitation, are essential in supporting the growth of dense vegetation and maintaining high levels of biological diversity found in tropical rainforests. On the other hand, forest B is a temperate forest, characterized by distinct seasonal changes, and it experiences lower levels of insolation compared to tropical regions. 3. Day length: The duration of daylight hours also impacts the amount of insolation a particular region receives. In tropical areas like forest A, the length of the day remains relatively constant throughout the year, with only small fluctuations during solstices and equinoxes. This enables a relatively constant level of insolation to reach the surface. Conversely, temperate regions like forest B have more pronounced seasonal variations in daylight hours, with longer days in summer and shorter days in winter. As a result, the amount of insolation that reaches the surface varies throughout the year. 4. Atmospheric conditions: Difference in atmospheric conditions can also play a role in determining the amount of insolation received by different regions. Tropical regions like forest A have more persistent cloud cover, which could limit insolation to some extent. However, the direct angle of sunlight and overall climate still result in higher insolation compared to temperate regions like forest B. In conclusion, forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would receive more insolation compared to forest B, the temperate forest in Germany. This is due to its equatorial location, consistently warmer climate, relatively stable daylight hours, and direct angle of incoming sunlight. These factors combined contribute to the lush and diverse biological environment characteristic of tropical rainforests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Omen III: The Final Conflict Movie plot: Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), now 32 years old and head of his late uncle's international conglomerate, is appointed Ambassador to Great Britain, the same position his adoptive father held in the first film. Unlike the previous Omen films, the adult Damien is now entirely aware of his unholy lineage, and his destiny.An alignment of the stars in the Cassiopeia region of the night sky causes the generation of a 'superstar', described in the film as a second Star of Bethlehem. Thorn realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming of Christ and he orders all boys in England born on the morning of March 24, 1982 (the morning when, in the story, the Cassiopeia alignment occurred) to be killed in order to prevent the Christ-child's return to power.A subplot deals with one of Thorn's disciples, Harvey Dean, attempting to hide the fact that his own son was born at the appointed time; Dean not only fails at hiding that fact about his child from Damien, but is killed by his own hypnotized wife - likely in retaliation for refusing to go through with Damien's command to murder his son as a test of loyalty (the last child whom Damien suspects).Thorn has also become romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow), a complex relationship which undermines his plans for political dominion for the time being. But Damien is not deterred from his plans and even focuses his attention on her preadolescent son Peter (Barnaby Holm), whom he takes as a disciple, partly by manipulating and exploiting the boy's internal desire to have a father-figure.Meanwhile, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi) and six other priests armed with the seven daggers of Megiddo - ancient holy weapons which are the only Earthly weapons which can harm the Antichrist - hunt Thorn in the hope of killing him before he can destroy the Christ-child.

Steven LaVoie, 54, the CEO of the technology company ArrowStream, is hospitalized in Northwestern Memorial Hospital after a worker pulled a gun out during a private meeting he requested with LaVoie inside the downtown Chicago building. Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said the gunman then fatally shot himself. \\"Apparently he was despondent over the fact that he got demoted,\\" McCarthy said, adding that the alleged shooter was among \\"a number of people\\" being demoted as the company downsized. The alleged gunman was later identified by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office as 60-year-old Anthony DeFrances. A man by the same name is listed as an executive on the website for ArrowStream, a supply-chain management technology company whose address is on the 17th floor of Bank of America building, where the shootings occurred. According to ArrowStream's website, LaVoie founded the company in 2000, and DeFrances joined the next year and was currently its chief technology officer. Both men are listed as married with three children. Police were called just before 10 a.m. to the building, which is a few blocks from the Willis Tower, the country's second-tallest skyscraper, and a block from the Chicago Board of Trade. Officers cordoned off the immediate area outside, and SWAT team members and other officers rushed inside. They found two men on the floor, both of them shot, according to police. Workers elsewhere in the building said they received warnings from building security over the intercom and in emails around 10 a.m. telling them there was a security situation in the lobby and to stay at their desks. \\"It was a tense atmosphere, everybody was walking around, you wanted more details but they wouldn't give us much,\\" said Stefano Freddo, who works on the building's 10th floor. He said someone came over the intercom a few minutes later to tell them it was safe to leave their offices. Freddo, 32, said security officers are stationed in the building, and that workers need a badge showing they work there to gain access to the elevators in the lobby.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there.

Summarize the following: These may indicate pancreatic cancer, or some other ailment. Since early signs and symptoms may be ambiguous, they are often not associated with the pancreas until the disease is quite advanced. Early issues include: Moderate abdominal and/or back pain Nausea (not vomiting) Loss of appetite (food is less desirable) Unexplained significant weight loss Yellow jaundice (which also causes itchy skin) Chronic pain Severe nausea Frequent vomiting Malabsorption of food Blood glucose control problems/Diabetes (since the pancreas makes and releases insulin but becomes dysfunctional). It is not easily scanned nor viewable behind the stomach and near the small intestines. The stages are: Stage 0: Not spread. A single layer/small group of cells in the pancreas -- not yet visible on imaging tests or to the unaided eye. Stage I: Local growth. Pancreatic cancer is growing in the pancreas, Stage 1A is less than 2 centimeters (0.79 in) (approx 3/4 in) across, but Stage IB is greater than 2 centimeters. Stage II: Local spread. Pancreatic cancer is larger, protruding outside the pancreas, or has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage III: Spread nearby. The tumor has expanded such as encasing nearby major blood vessels or nerves (unlikely to be operable, unless very limited spread) -- as well as into nearby lymph nodes -- but is not known to have metastasized to any distant organ. Stage IV: Confirmed distant spread. Pancreatic cancer has been found in distant organs such as lungs, liver, colon, etc. -- probably inoperable.","completion":"Pancreatic cancer is a sickness that might be hard to find early because the signs are not clear. Some early signs are tummy and back pain, feeling sick but not throwing up, not wanting to eat, losing weight without trying, having yellow skin that feels itchy. It is also hard to see this sickness in our body because it hides behind our tummy really well. There are different stages of this sickness. Stage 0 is very tiny and can't be seen easily. Stage I is when it starts to grow inside the pancreas, and it can be a little or a lot bigger. Stage II is when it grows even more and starts to push outside the pancreas. Stage III is when it spreads close to other important parts in our body like blood vessels or nerves, and makes it hard to remove. Stage IV is when it spreads far away to other organs like our lungs or liver, and it usually can't be taken out."},{"prompt":"Q:This article: The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of annihilation by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers.

Sentence: \\"I brought John a razor with which to shave myself.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"From a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"I brought John a razor with which to shave myself.\\" could be considered both acceptable and unacceptable, depending on the context and the specific linguistic framework being applied. Let's explore these perspectives in more detail. 1. Acceptable: Within the context of informal speech or written communication, language users often use structures that do not strictly follow the rules of formal language but are still understood by the intended audience. The sentence in question would likely be understood by most English speakers, despite its ambiguity. People often use shortcuts, colloquialisms, and unconventional syntax in everyday language, so it could be acceptable in those terms. In this instance, the speaker may want to emphasize that they're not directly involved in the shaving process but instead that the razor is a gift for John – while still keeping the focus on the speaker's intentions. This kind of emphasis can sometimes lead to unconventional syntax, such as seen in the given sentence. 2. Unacceptable: From a formal linguistic point of view, the sentence contains an issue with pronoun reference, which can result in ambiguity. The pronoun \\"myself\\" generally refers back to the speaker (\\"I\\"), but the presence of \\"John\\" in the sentence makes the sentence more confusing. It is unclear whether \\"myself\\" is referring to the speaker or incorrectly referring to John. To correct the sentence, the speaker could replace the pronoun \\"myself\\" with the proper noun \\"John\\" or restructure the sentence as follows: \\"I brought John a razor so that he could shave.\\" By rephrasing it, the ambiguity is eliminated, and the sentence adheres to the more conventional grammatical structure, which would be suitable for formal context. Moreover, with the traditional Prescriptive Grammar approach, a linguist would likely consider this sentence unacceptable as it contains a problematic pronoun reference. In conclusion, whether the sentence is acceptable or not depends on the specific context and linguistic framework applied. In an informal context or when analyzing the sentence from a descriptive linguistics perspective, it could be considered acceptable. However, for formal communication or from a prescriptive grammar standpoint, the sentence would likely be deemed unacceptable due to the ambiguity created by the pronoun reference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well.

As the name suggests, the recording is digital rather than analog. DAT has the ability to record at higher, equal or lower sampling rates than a CD (48, 44.1 or 32 kHz sampling rate respectively) at 16 bits quantization. If a digital source is copied then the DAT will produce an exact clone, unlike other digital media such as Digital Compact Cassette or non-Hi-MD MiniDisc, both of which use a lossy data reduction system. - Ween is an American alternative rock band formed in New Hope, Pennsylvania, in 1984 by childhood friends Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo, better known by their respective stage names, Gene Ween and Dean Ween.

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Monumental Hubris - Forbes.com History has a funny way of humbling men. So do markets. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Lehman Brothers' (nyse: LEH - news - people ) fall is that it comes almost seven years to the day after 9/11. That day was supposed to teach us humility. The fall of Lehman, coming six months after the collapse of Bear Stearns and coupled with Merrill Lynch's (nyse: MER - news - people ) disappearance as an independent company, are the result of a complete lack of humility on the part of those executives charged with leading the world's most important purveyors of capital in the post-9/11 world. For all the talk of pulling together in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook America to the core and that supposedly set our priorities straight, Wall Street rushed headlong back to its mindless pursuit of profits and speculation without consideration for the consequences of its actions. Now, the chickens have come home to roost. In April 2008, our firm, Hegemony Capital Management, published a controversial essay entitled \\"How to Fix It,\\" in which we outlined our (unsolicited) recommendations for how to correct the excesses that led to the credit crisis that began in mid-2007 and brought us to these historic days. Special Offer: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hit the skids! Merrill gets sold, Lehman goes under. Blood is certainly in the streets. What are you buying? Click here for a free trial of Forbes-Lehmann Income Securities Investor with new recommended buys of bank preferred stocks offering double-digit yields. Our key recommendations, which seemed much more radical in April than they do today, were the following: --Improve financial industry regulation and replace substance over form in the regulation we have. --Place absolute leverage limitations on financial institutions at much lower levels than the 30:1 levels that led to this crisis. --Place an absolute limitation on hedge fund leverage. --Regulate Wall Street compensation by basing it on multiple years' performance, adding claw-backs and high-water marks and limit cash compensation that weakens these firms' balance sheets. --Tax private equity firms' carried interests at ordinary interest rates rather than capital gains rates and restrict private equity firms' ability to go public. --Re-institute the uptick rule with respect to short selling. Finally, we made the point that too much economic activity in the U.S. was aimed at speculation rather than production. For example, the equity markets are increasingly dominated by quantitative investment strategies that are driven by considerations that are totally divorced from considerations of fundamental value. At the same time, the credit markets are increasingly utilized to finance change-of-control transactions for private equity firms that are done simply because low-cost financing is available, not because a project is going to add to the productive capacity or capital account of the nation. As we wrote in that April issue, \\"At some point, society has to figure out that the way an investor earns his money is even more important than the amount of money he makes. This is why human beings were vested with moral sentiments, so they could distinguish the quality of human conduct from the quantity of its results.\\" These changes cannot and will not be effected simply by legislative fiat. It is incumbent upon the gatekeepers of capital, the fiduciaries that make the decisions about allocating capital, to bring discipline to the system. This will require a rethinking of their priorities and a willingness to add to their investment calculus considerations that exceed their own narrow interests about short-term investment returns. Special Offer: Low-risk time to buy stocks? Click here for a free trial of InvesTech Research with veteran money manager Jim Stack's latest outlook and portfolio moves. Our system requires a new concept of fiduciary duty that encompasses systemic as well as single-firm interests, and that focuses to a greater degree on risk-adjusted returns than raw numerical returns. Obviously the forces that led to current events have been building for many years, and the changes needed to fix the system will not be made overnight, but we should not let this occasion pass to reflect on what has occurred. It is clear to us that the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are not underestimating the enormity of the crisis. AIG (nyse: AIG - news - people ) is a much larger systemic threat than Lehman Brothers ever was, so this situation is profoundly serious. In our judgment, investors should not try to pick a bottom in today's or this week's market. The market is going to experience extraordinary volatility in the immediate future. Play the market at your own risk and only with money you can afford to lose. The indexes are heading significantly lower, as we have previously forecast. Gold, short-term U.S. Treasuries, short-term Swiss and German government paper, the Swiss franc and certain Asian currencies like the Singapore dollar are the safest places to park your cash for the moment. The U.S. dollar continues to be debased (less against the euro, which remains compromised, than against Asian currencies and the Swiss franc), particularly by the startling and historic decision by the Federal Reserve to accept equity securities at its discount window. If nothing else, that decision alone suggests the enormity and depth of the crisis we are facing. We never thought we'd live to see the day that the American central bank would accept equity as collateral for loans. We have to admit that took us by surprise and made us very nervous. Michael E. Lewitt is editor of the HCM Market Letter and president of Hegemony Capital Management in Boca Raton, Fla. Summary:","completion":"The fall of Lehman Brothers, collapse of Bear Stearns, and disappearance of Merrill Lynch as an independent company are attributed to a lack of humility in financial leadership following 9/11. Excessive pursuit of profits and speculation led to the credit crisis, and the necessary changes will not happen overnight. Hegemony Capital Management suggests tightening regulations, limiting leverage, and prioritizing long-term investment returns while predicting significant market volatility in the immediate future. Gold, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and certain currencies are recommended as safe havens for personal cash."},{"prompt":"Q:jesse was a weird person so he picked up riley's phone.

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) (Associated Press) PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (AP) — On a snowboard and skis, Ester Ledecka is a history-making Olympic gold medalist. One of the surprising breakout stars of the Winter Games, the Czech pulled double-duty on the slopes in Pyeongchang and became the first to win snowboarding's parallel giant slalom and skiing's Alpine super-G. She outraced Selina Joerg of Germany to the line in the final of the snowboarding event Saturday and won by .46 seconds. That came seven days after she won the super-G by .01 seconds — and shocked everyone, including herself. \\"It was a great day,\\" Ledecka said Saturday. \\"I enjoyed every run and I'm very happy to be here and stand on the highest place.\\" That's also where the United States' curling team is after winning the men's final , beating Sweden 10-7. The upset was only the second curling medal in U.S. history, with the first coming in a bronze-medal game at the 2006 Turin Games. \\"It feels almost unbelievable,\\" Team USA's Matt Hamilton said, \\"but we came out here with great intensity and just had to believe we could do it, and make our shots.\\" Switzerland won the debut of the Alpine team event, but Norway's third-place finish gave it a record 38 medals at a single Winter Olympics. \\"Even underneath the suit, I get goosebumps talking about it,\\" Norway's Leif Kristian Nestvold-Haugen said. Iivo Niskanen of Finland took gold in cross-country's 50-kilometer mass start , Sebastien Toutant of Canada won the men's Big Air snowboarding event and Nevin Galmarini of Switzerland was the winner of the men's parallel giant slalom. Two more gold medals were scheduled to be awarded later Saturday: the men's and women's mass start events in speedskating. Also, Japan and Britain were playing for the bronze in women's curling, and the Czech Republic was taking on Canada for bronze in men's hockey. At Yongpyong Alpine Center, Ledecka had the fastest qualifying time in the women's parallel giant slalom. Her fourth race was decided when her opponent slid off the course. She had been considered a favorite for gold in snowboarding after being the top-ranked woman on the circuit, but she hadn't come even close to that success in skiing. Until last week. \\"(People) were reminding me, 'Yeah, you're a skier, you did a great success,' which was very nice,\\" she said, \\"but I was thinking, 'OK, but you have to change and be a snowboarder already.'\\" No problems there. \\"What happened here,\\" said Ledecka's snowboard coach, Justin Reiter, \\"was once-in-a-lifetime.\\" MIRACURL ON ICE John Shuster has been part of both of the United States' men's curling medals, this time skipping the squad to the upset of Sweden. He converted a double-takeout for a five-ender in the eighth, a very rare score that made it 10-5 and basically sealed the win. The U.S. needed three straight victories to advance to the playoffs and then a semifinal victory over three-time defending gold medalist Canada to get here. \\"We knew we were close,\\" Hamilton said, \\"and to make the breakthrough here at the Olympics is just amazing.\\" MEDAL HEADS Norway leads the medals table with 13 gold, 14 silver and 11 bronze, breaking the record of 37 overall set at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics by the Americans. \\"It's just a really cool feeling to feel that the whole team succeeded today,\\" Nina Haver-Loeseth said after Norway edged France for the bronze. \\"I think that Norwegian Alpine skiers had a very successful Olympics. We've been at the medal plaza, cheering our teammates on and I was like, 'We are not leaving here without a medal.' So it means a lot.\\" Switzerland knocked off top-seeded Austria in the gold-medal race. Leading 2-1, Swiss ski racer Daniel Yule wrapped up the win when Austrian rival Marco Schwarz skied out along the side-by-side parallel slalom course. \\"For us skiers who usually are always doing an individual sport, to just do this all together like this for Team Switzerland, that was just amazing,\\" Yule said. \\"It's just that much more fun.\\" FINLAND'S FINEST Niskanen beat out Russian rival Alexander Bolshunov with a strong sprint in the 50-kilometer mass start to give Finland its first gold of the Pyeongchang Games. \\"The first, but not the last,\\" Niskanen said. \\"Tomorrow is a new day. I (was) wanting to win my gold medal (over) this distance and it had been long years.\\" Niskanen won the marathon event in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 22.1 seconds — more than 18 seconds ahead of Bolshunov. Another Russian, Andrey Larkov, won the bronze. SOARING TO GOLD Toutant won in the Olympic debut of men's Big Air by scoring 174.25 points in the final. Kyle Mack of the United States took second with a score of 168.75, and Billy Morgan of Britain earned bronze. Red Gerard, who won the first gold medal for the United States in Pyeongchang in the slopestyle event two weeks ago, finished fifth. ___ More AP Olympics: https://wintergames.ap.org ||||| Ester Ledecka Makes History, Winning Olympic Gold In Both Snowboarding And Skiing Enlarge this image toggle caption Clive Rose/Getty Images Clive Rose/Getty Images With a gold medal in the snowboard parallel giant slalom, Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic has become the first woman in Winter Olympics history to win a gold medal in two different sports at the same Olympic Games. On Saturday she emerged victorious in the final run against Germany's Selina Joerg, finishing just 0.46 seconds ahead. Joerg took silver in the event, followed by Ramona Theresia Hofmeister, also of Germany, who took bronze. A week earlier, Ledecka surprised spectators and herself by taking a gold medal — in skiing. Ledecka finished first in the women's super-G in Alpine skiing, finishing several spots ahead of the decorated American skier Lindsey Vonn. But Ledecka is best known and has seen the most success as a snowboarder, where she's won world titles and competed in the Winter Games in Sochi four years ago. Ledecka is the third athlete to win gold in two events in the same Winter Games, according to analytics company Gracenote. The last time it happened was in 1928, with Johan Grøttumsbråten taking gold in the Nordic combined and cross-country skiing. Four years earlier, Thorleif Haug achieved the same thing, the company says. The 22-year-old Ledecka earlier made Olympic history just by being the first woman to compete in both the Alpine skiing and snowboarding events. She first skied at age 2 and snowboarded at age 5, according to The New York Times, but refused to follow the conventional wisdom of her coaches to give up one sport in order to specialize. In the men's snowboarding parallel giant slalom, Nevin Galmarini of Switzerland was the gold medal winner, besting his silver medal he won in Sochi in 2014. Lee Sang-ho of South Korea finished 0.43 seconds behind to take silver, the country's first medal in a snowboarding event. Zan Kosir of Slovenia was the bronze winner, beating Sylvain Dufour of France in the \\"small final,\\" which determines the contest's overall third place. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The 2018 Winter Olympics, held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was a historic event, marked by the remarkable achievements of several athletes across many diverse sporting disciplines. Specifically, the United States Curling team demonstrated exceptional performance and claimed the gold medal when Joe Polo, John Landsteiner, Matt Hamilton, Tyler George, John Shuster, and captain Phill Drobnick triumphed over Sweden in the men's curling venue ceremony on Saturday, February 24, 2018. This victory achieved not only jubilation among the American team but also marked the second time that the US received a medal in curling with the first-ever win being in the 2006 Turin Games. Intriguingly, amidst the celebrations, apathy did not dim the athletes' performance. Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic showcased a spectacularly unique talent by showing proficiency in two sporting domains, skiing and snowboarding. As a result, she won the gold medal in snowboarding's parallel giant slalom and skiing's Alpine super-G. Her achieving this milestone established her as the first sportswoman in the Winter Olympics that won gold medals in two different sports at the same Olympic Games. The success surprised many, including herself. Her surprise gold medal win in skiing followed by a top spot in snowboarding led her to be acknowledged as one of the surprising breakout stars of the Winter Games and claimed her a spot in Olympic history. It should be mentioned that in the final race on the slopes, she outraced Selina Joerg of Germany in the snowboarding event on the preceding Saturday, winning by .46 seconds. Additionally, it's important to mention the victories of Iivo Niskanen of Finland who took gold in cross-country's 50-kilometer mass start, Sebastien Toutant of Canada emerging as the winner of the men's Big Air snowboarding event, and Nevin Galmarini of Switzerland in earning the winning spot in the men's parallel giant slalom. Furthermore, the debut Alpine team event was dominated by the Swiss team, while Norway's third-place finish earned it a record 38 medals, marking a significant achievement in the history of the Winter Olympics. Overall, the Winter Olympics witnessed a trove of achievements, memorable not just for the records broken, but also for exemplifying a unique display of athleticism, will, and skill. Celebrated and cheered on by fans and fellow competitors alike, the athletes' triumphs were a testament to their continuous hard work, dedication, passion, and perseverance.

Finnish is a Uralic language and is primarily spoken in Finland, where it is the official language, and has a minority language status in Sweden. The sentence, \\"Hän sanoi: 'Olemme epäonnistuneet yhdessä torjumaan nälänhätää'\\", can be translated to English as \\"He/She said: 'We have failed together in combating famine'\\". Finnish is a member of the Finnic group of languages, which also includes Estonian, Karelian, and other lesser-known languages spoken around the Baltic Sea region. Unlike most languages spoken in Europe, Finnish is not an Indo-European language. Instead, it belongs to the Uralic language family, which also includes Hungarian, Saami, and several smaller languages spoken in northeastern Europe and Russia. Finnish is characterized by its rich morphology, complex grammatical structures, and a variety of case endings. Typically, Finnish words can have numerous forms due to various combinations of these case endings. One notable feature of Finnish is the vowel harmony system, which means that certain vowels can only appear with certain other vowels in the same word. For example, front vowels (ä, ö, and y) cannot mix with back vowels (a, o, and u) within the same word, except for compound words or loanwords. The standard Finnish language (yleiskieli) is mainly based on the dialect spoken in the capital area, although regional dialects are still very much alive and can differ significantly across the country. Finnish has been written using the Roman alphabet since the 16th century, with the addition of a few special characters, such as 'ä' and 'ö'. The first known Finnish text is \\"Abckiria\\", a book of religious teachings and grammar rules, written by Mikael Agricola in the 1540s. Finnish literature has produced many world-renowned authors and works, including the national epic \\"Kalevala\\" compiled by Elias Lönnrot, and authors like F.E. Sillanpää, a Nobel Prize laureate in literature, and renowned playwright and poet Eino Leino. In conclusion, the given sentence is in Finnish, a language with a rich grammar, unique pronunciation system, and vibrant history that distinguishes it from the majority of European languages. Finnish continues to have a significant cultural impact in Finland and neighboring countries through education, literature, and daily communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. Paragraph: Alexander is heating up water in his kitchen because he is preparing to make pasta. He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy? A:","completion":"Container B has particles with lower average kinetic energy. Step-by-step justification: 1. The background information states that as a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. 2. Since container A has been heating up for a longer amount of time, it has had more time for its particles to gain kinetic energy. 3. In comparison, container B has been heating up for a shorter amount of time, meaning its particles have had less time to gain kinetic energy. 4.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person Frederic Leighton used as a model?

The Texas church where a gunman opened fire during Sunday services, killing 26 and injuring 20, may not reopen. Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents as he was leaving the church.

Drawing a connection between the speaker's reaction of sickness towards the animals being run over in the neighborhood and their hypothetical enjoyment in deliberately killing them with their car appears contradictory. Not only is the hypothesis incongruous with the sentiment expressed in the premise, but it also reflects the opposite emotion. The premise suggests that the speaker is empathetic and concerned about the welfare of animals, and they feel distressed when witnessing their suffering. The hypothesis, on the other hand, portrays the speaker as someone who enjoys harming animals intentionally, which contradicts the emotions presented in the premise.

Options: - library - lawn - front door - jail - subway Explain why a human would choose \\"library\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"library\\" as the answer to the question because libraries are versatile institutions specifically designed for the preservation, collection, and provision of various information resources, which include newspapers. The primary reason one is likely to find an old newspaper at a library is due to the following factors: 1. Historical archives: Libraries often maintain comprehensive archives containing old copies of local, national, and international newspapers. These historical records serve as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and anyone interested in understanding past events or studying media coverage from a specific time period. Libraries act as a repository for this type of material, making it accessible to the public. 2. Preservation: Libraries are institutions that take great care in preserving the materials in their collection. Newspapers, being made of paper, can become fragile and deteriorate over time if not stored in proper conditions. Libraries are equipped with climate-controlled storage facilities and trained staff who are well-versed in preservation techniques, ensuring that old newspapers are kept in good condition for future generations to access and learn from. 3. Organization: Libraries not only store old newspapers, but they also have efficient organizational systems in place that allow users to locate specific editions or articles they're looking for. Cataloging and classification systems, such as the Dewey Decimal System or Library of Congress Classification, help users navigate the vast collections of information available in libraries, including old newspapers. 4. Accessibility: Libraries make it their mission to provide access to information for all members of the community, regardless of socioeconomic status or background. This means that they strive to maintain a diverse collection of resources, including old newspapers, that would otherwise be difficult for the average person to obtain. By providing this access, libraries play a crucial role in promoting knowledge, learning, and understanding within society. 5. Digitalization: In recent years, many libraries have taken steps to digitize their newspaper collections in order to make them more easily available to users online. This process not only helps preserve the physical newspapers themselves, but it also allows interested individuals to search through and access old newspaper archives from the comfort of their own homes. In contrast, the other options listed - lawn, front door, jail, and subway - are not as suitable for finding an old newspaper. Newspapers left on lawns and front doors are usually current editions and are likely to be discarded or recycled after being read. Jails and subways may occasionally have old newspapers that inmates or passengers have left behind, but these locations are not specifically designed for the preservation or public accessibility of newspapers. In summary, a human would choose \\"library\\" as the answer to this question because libraries are institutions that actively collect, preserve, and make old newspapers accessible to the public. This focus on providing information to all members of society makes libraries the most fitting choice among the options given."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the party, Dennis meets Cat Lam, a female police inspector who decides to tell him about a police investigation involving the murder of a young girl. The story flashes back to when Cat meets Josephine Wong, a police commissioner who wishes to re-open an investigation involving the death of a young girl at the hands of her mother. She is joined by her female colleagues: Barbara, a criminologist; and Ivy, a police sergeant. Josephine decides to conduct an interrogation with the suspect, Becky Lee.

Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field. In... Question: What will happen to human bodies in space? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Pressure in the skull will be raised.\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"Pressure in the skull will be raised.\\" In space, human bodies experience several physiological changes due to the lack of gravity. As mentioned in the article, one of the most significant issues is the redistribution of bodily fluids, particularly water. Our bodies are about 70% water, and when there is no gravity, this water moves up towards the head, raising pressure in the skull. This increase in pressure can cause a chain reaction of other problems, including changes in eye shape, which can result in vision problems. Astronauts who spent weeks in space on the International Space Station reported changes in their eyesight due to the physical alterations in their eye shape. Research showed that the right eye was often affected more than the left, and men were more affected than women. In addition to pressure in the skull and vision issues, astronauts also face other challenges such as muscle deterioration, bone loss, difficulties in eating and sleeping, and exposure to radiation. While scientists have developed some methods to counteract some of these effects, such as exercise machines to reduce bone loss, there are still many problems that need to be solved before humans can embark on extended trips to the Moon, asteroids, or Mars. Therefore, it is essential to continue researching and developing technologies and techniques to ensure astronauts' health and well-being during long-term space exploration. As humans possess a natural desire to explore the unknown, overcoming these challenges will open up a new realm of possibilities for discovery and understanding of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: too heavy and bulky Review: This pogo stick is much too heavy, stiff, and bulky. It is very difficult to jump on because of this. I had to return it for my 14 year old son who is normally very coordinated. Not so with this item.","completion":"Based on the review left by the customer, it is clear that they were dissatisfied with the product. The title, \\"too heavy and bulky,\\" immediately conveys a negative impression of the pogo stick. As we dive deeper into the content of the review, several reasons for this dissatisfaction become apparent. Firstly, the customer mentions that the pogo stick is \\"much too heavy, stiff, and bulky,\\" which suggests that it does not possess the desired qualities for a good pogo stick experience. A pogo stick is supposed to be light and flexible enough for easy jumping, and if it is too heavy and stiff, it would be difficult to use effectively. Secondly, the customer points out the difficulty in using the product by stating that \\"it is very difficult to jump on because of this.\\" In this context, \\"this\\" refers to the described heaviness, stiffness, and bulkiness. It indicates that the customer had trouble using the pogo stick, which further contributed to the negative experience. Moreover, the review mentions the customer's 14-year-old son, who is said to be \\"normally very coordinated.\\" Nevertheless, he also faced issues using this particular pogo stick (\\"not so with this item\\"), which implies that the product's design or features are perhaps inadequate or unsuitable for its intended purpose. Lastly, the fact that the customer \\"had to return it\\" is a strong indication of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product. Returning a purchased item is usually seen as a last resort for buyers who are unsatisfied with their purchase, as it typically entails additional hassle and efforts. In conclusion, the customer's review, highlighting the product's heaviness, stiffness, bulkiness, and difficulty in use, demonstrates that they were dissatisfied with their purchase. This dissatisfaction was further solidified by the fact that they had to return the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A family friend of a U.S. soldier captured by the Taliban said his friends and family want Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl to \\"stand tall, stand firm.\\" Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl in a video made by his captors, members of the Taliban. \\"Bowe, if you see this, know that we love you and we are praying fervently for you and prayers are going up for you from all over the world,\\" Tim Baker told CNN affiliate KTVB-TV in the soldier's hometown of Ketchum, Idaho. \\"To all of our valiant men and women, know that the American people believe in you, support you and are 100 percent behind you, and we thank God every day that you have our back.\\" \\"Please continue to keep","completion":"Bowe Bergdahl and his family in your thoughts and prayers as they face this challenging time,\\" Baker continued. \\"We have not lost hope and we will not stop advocating for his safe return.\\" As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, the community in Ketchum, Idaho, held numerous vigils, rallies, and fundraisers to raise awareness for Bowe's plight and to show their support for his family. The impact of his captivity reached not only his hometown but also thousands of people across the nation and around the world. Pressure mounted on the U.S. government to negotiate with the Taliban to secure Bowe's release. After years of delicate negotiations, the talks began to show some promise. A potential prisoner exchange between the U.S. and the Taliban was proposed. In the meantime, Bowe was forced to adapt to his new reality -- a prisoner of war in an unfamiliar land, subjected to harsh treatment but trying to remain hopeful. Despite his ordeal, Bowe tried to learn his captors' language and assimilate their culture as best as he could. Meanwhile, his family and friends back home fervently hoped and prayed for his release from captivity. In May 2014, after nearly five years in captivity, Bowe Bergdahl's release was finally secured in exchange for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. It was a contentious decision, where some argued that it would encourage more hostage-taking, while others believed it was the only option to bring Bowe home safely. Upon his return to the U.S., Bowe faced a complicated response from the public, as many questioned the circumstances of his initial disappearance and capture. Some believed that he had willingly left his post, while others maintained that he had done so due to the harsh conditions he faced as a soldier. Bowe's hometown of Ketchum initially welcomed him with open arms, celebrating the return of a local hero. However, many within the military and veteran community expressed disappointment and resentment, feeling that he had betrayed his fellow soldiers. In December 2015, Bowe was formally charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Following a lengthy legal process, he pleaded guilty to both charges in October 2017. In November of the same year, Bowe was dishonorably discharged, reduced in rank, and sentenced to a forfeiture of pay. Though Bowe Bergdahl's story ends with a mixture of relief at his return and controversy surrounding the circumstances, the impact of his ordeal reaches far beyond his own life. His case highlights the complexities of war and the difficult decisions governments and families must face. Ultimately, the support and prayers of Bowe's friends, family, and community played an essential role in his survival and return, showing the power of human connection and resilience in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: \\"If you run for more than five minutes at any time, you might need a pair of running shoes.\\" Advises Stephen Pribut, a US sports expert. Running shoes are highly technical footwear. The provide stability while bearing up to three times the wearer's body weight. But it's not easy to find the right pair. Finding the right running shoes is something of an art, or a science and a feel. The science part begins with the shape of the arch of your foot, which anyone can find out at home with this quick experiment: Put your foot in water and place it on a piece of brown paper. If you see a \\"C\\" shape on the paper when you remove your foot, you have a rare high arch. If the shape looks more like a rectangle, that means you have flat feet. See something in between? That's a normal arch. Conveniently for shoppers, shoe companies nowadays divide their shoes in three categories: neutral ( for high arches), stability ( for normal or low arches) and motion control (for flat arches). So you'll know which type suits you. At this point, most people would just grab an appealing shoe and try it on, But professionals would do a few quality-control tests. First, you bend the shoe toe to heel to see where it bends. If it's not at the forefoot---where the foot actually be bends, be afraid. Then you grip both ends and twist in opposite directions. If you can twist it like a tower, it means there's zero support. Finally, you squeeze he heel in both directions. A stable heel won't _ . Now you need to check the mold that shapes the inside of the shoe: whether its wide or narrow in the mid-foot, how it sits on the heel and how roomy the toe box is. It's wise to make the shoe purchase in the late afternoon, to allow for any swelling that your feet do throughout the day. Toes also decide sizing choices. The rule is that you need a finger's width from your longest toe (whether that's your big one or not) to the end of the shoe.

Movie title: Doc Hollywood Movie plot: Dr. Benjamin Stone is a promising young surgeon working in Washington, D.C. with plans of making more money working for a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult made out of icing. Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina. The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone pay for the fence with cash. Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker. Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car. Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers. The small-town experience soon humbles Ben when he misdiagnoses a young boy as having mitral valve regurgitation leading to late cyanosis, a case the town's curmudgeonly doctor, Aurelius Hogue, treats with a Coca-Cola. Hogue explains that the boy had chewed his father's tobacco and was given too much bismuth subnitrate as an antacid, causing a blue tinge; the carbonic acid component of the soda would relieve his stomachache. The two finally bond when Ben saves Hogue after he suffers a near-fatal heart attack.

The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.","completion":"The Chicxulub crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s.

Hypothesis: Pollsters change polls to aid clients. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. To understand this, let's break down the statements: Premise: Meanwhile, their pollsters skew the polls to suit their clients' politics. This premise suggests that pollsters manipulate the results of opinion polls in a way that benefits their clients' political inclinations. It insinuates that instead of presenting impartial outcomes, these pollsters twist the data to align with their clients' political views. Hypothesis: Pollsters change polls to aid clients. The hypothesis states that pollsters alter the polls they conduct with the purpose of helping their clients in some way. It implies that the pollsters' actions are not neutral; instead, they serve the interests of those who hired them. When we compare these two statements, we can see that the premise and hypothesis are fundamentally similar. In both cases, pollsters are engaging in behavior that is not neutral or objective. They are interfering with the polling process to obtain results that favor their clients, and by doing so, they undermine the integrity of the data. Thus, it is accurate to say that the premise entails the hypothesis, as the actions described in the premise—skewing the polls to suit clients' politics—essentially lead to the outcome expressed in the hypothesis, which is pollsters changing polls to aid clients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. and a hint : Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming.

This could mean that there might be some sort of optical illusion or a distortion based on a specific vantage point. Additionally, it implies that the models in Part II provide information or a theoretical framework to support the idea that the lines may not cross despite seemingly doing so. Now let's consider the hypothesis: \\"You will find out if the lines in figure 9 actually cross by looking at the next one, figure 10.\\" This statement suggests that by examining Figure 10, one would be able to determine whether or not the lines in Figure 9 truly cross. To assess the entailment of this hypothesis based on the given premise, we need to evaluate whether the premise logically implies this hypothesis. If the premise were true and the lines in Figure 9 appear to cross but may not, this would mean that there is room for doubt or the existence of conflicting information. It also implies that the models in Part II could potentially provide information that either confirms the appearance or clarifies that it is just an illusion or distortion. However, the premise does not specifically state that Figure 10 holds the key to resolving this uncertainty. If Figure 10 were to provide a different angle or additional information that clarifies the situation, it is possible that examining it could help determine the reality of the lines crossing in Figure 9. But the premise does not guarantee that Figure 10 will provide that necessary insight. Therefore, while the premise raises the possibility of an alternative interpretation of the lines in Figure 9 and acknowledges the models in Part II as a source of relevant information, it does not logically entail the hypothesis that one can find out if the lines actually cross by looking at Figure 10. The hypothesis might be true in some cases, but the premise does not provide enough information to definitively establish its validity.

Article: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight? Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts. You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These \\"good\\" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat. Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional \\"good\\" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later. So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. Question: The purpose of writing this passage is to _ . Options: A: introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight B: analyze the influence of obesity on kids C: give advice on how to lose weight quickly D: explain the function of bacteria in foods Answer:","completion":"A: introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight"},{"prompt":"Build a movie plot around this: Who has been murdering European finance ministers as part of his plan?

The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\". NME's Steve Lamacq described the album as \\"a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock\\", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it.

The movie centers on the life and events that unfold around the case of Isabel's death. Main Characters: 1. Dr. James Norton: A renowned psychiatrist, and the head of Woodhaven Psychiatric Hospital. He is dedicated to his profession but harbors a dark secret. 2. Isabel Thompson: A young patient at the hospital who is haunted by a traumatic past that led to her confinement at Woodhaven. 3. John Harris: A new investigative reporter, determined to uncover the truth behind the mysterious deaths at the hospital. 4. Anna Forbes: A nurse at Woodhaven, who becomes John's confidant during the investigation. Movie Plot: Dr. James Norton is a psychiatrist who has devoted his life to helping his patients overcome their inner demons at Woodhaven Psychiatric Hospital. The hospital has a history of enigmatic deaths, but the staff is tight-lipped about the events. When news breaks about the recent death of Isabel Thompson, an investigative journalist, John Harris, picks up the story. John decides to go undercover as a maintenance worker at the hospital in an attempt to find the truth about Isabel's death. During his investigation, he discovers that Isabel had been admitted to the hospital by her family after she claimed to be haunted by the ghost of her twin sister. As John infiltrates the hospital, he meets Anna Forbes, a nurse who is also disturbed by the series of unexplained deaths. Together, they uncover that Dr. Norton has developed an experimental treatment involving hypnosis and psychoactive drugs to access the deepest, darkest corners of patients' minds, ultimately leading to repressed memories resurfacing. Isabel, during her treatments with Dr. Norton, had become increasingly paranoid and aggressive, claiming that her twin sister, who had died in a tragic accident years prior, continued to torment her. Despite Dr. Norton's attempts to suppress her claims, Isabel's condition deteriorated, culminating in her untimely death. As John and Anna delve deeper into the mystery, they realize that some of the patients, including Isabel, had not only been subjected to the experimental treatments, but also to a harrowing form of psychological manipulation, turning them into unwitting participants in a series of brutal and deadly battles against their inner demons. With the hospital's employees becoming increasingly suspicious of John's true intentions, a race against time ensues as John and Anna gather evidence to expose the horrifying truth behind the walls of Woodhaven Psychiatric Hospital and Isabel's tragic demise. In a nail-biting climax, Dr. Norton confronts John and Anna about their meddling. He defends his methods by explaining that the patients' experiences were necessary for their rehabilitation. A tense struggle breaks out, during which Dr. Norton accidentally falls and suffers a fatal injury. John and Anna, now in possession of evidence to expose the hospital's dark secrets, succeed in shutting down Woodhaven and ensuring the safety of its patients. The movie ends with the ghost of Isabel ascending peacefully into the afterlife, while John, Anna, and the surviving patients start the process of healing from their traumatic experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Tobruk Movie plot: In September 1942, Rommel's Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144Â km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack. The author of the plan, Canadian born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) had been captured by Vichy French forces. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in south-eastern Libya. Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German field guns protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the RAF. They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as POWs escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full Naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers. Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \\"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\\", stating that when he originally submitted the plan they could have blown up the fuel bunkers with only a handful of men before questioning how they were supposed to get through well established German defences now. While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \\"maximum effort, land, sea and air\\".

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Montreal(Reuters)-Crossing the US-Canada border to go to church on a Sunday cost a US citizen 10,000for breaking Washington's strict new security rules. The expensive trip to church was a surprise for Richard Albert, who lives right on the Canadian border. Like the other half-dozen people of Township 15, crossing the border is a daily occurrence for Albert. The nearby Quebec village of St. Pamphile is where they shop, eat and go to church. There are many such situations in these areas along the largely unguarded 5,530-mile border between Canada and the US -- which in some cases actually runs down the middle of streets or through buildings. As a result, Albert says he did not expect any problems three weeks ago when he returned home to the US after attending church in Canada, as usual. The US customs station in this area is closed on Sundays, so he just drove around the locked gate, as he had done every weekend since the gate appeared last May, following a tightening of border security. Two days later, Albert was told to go to the customs office, where an officer told him he had been caught on camera crossing the border illegally. Ottawa has given out special passes to some 300 US citizens in that area so they can enter the country when Canadian customs stations are closed, but the US stopped a similar program last May. That forces the people to a 200-mile detour along hilly roads to get home through another border checkpoint. Albert has requested that the customs office change their decisions on the fine, but he has not attended a Sunday church since. \\"I feel like I'm living in a prison.\\" he said. Question: The best title for the text could e _ . Options: A: A Cross-country Trip B: A Special Border Pass C: An Unguarded Border D: An Expensive Church Visit The answer is:","completion":"D: An Expensive Church Visit Step 1: Read the article and understand its main theme. The article primarily discusses the situation where Richard Albert, a US citizen living near the Canadian border, was fined 10,000 for breaking the border's security rules to attend church in Canada. Step 2: Evaluate each option in relation to the main theme of the article. - Option A: A Cross-country Trip - This option doesn't capture the essence of the article. The article doesn't emphasize a long journey or trip. - Option B: A Special Border Pass - While border passes are mentioned in the article, they are not the main focus. The article addresses the consequences of crossing the border without proper authorization. - Option C: An Unguarded Border - The article does mention that the border is largely unguarded, but it's not the central theme. The main focus is the fine imposed on Albert due to crossing the border without observing the security rules. - Option D: An Expensive Church Visit - This option directly relates to the main theme of the article as it highlights the consequence (fine) of Albert's actions when crossing the border to attend church. Step 3: Choose the best option that resonates with the main theme of the article. In this case, Option D: An Expensive Church Visit, is the most appropriate title as it captures the essence of the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"Joutjärvi\\" itself is a combination of \\"jout\\" and \\"järvi,\\" possibly signifying a certain aspect of the lake or its surrounding environment. An important aspect of the Finnish language is its completely different structure and vocabulary from the English and other Romance or Germanic languages. Nevertheless, names, particularly proper nouns, often do not have equivalents in other languages and are, therefore, used in their original form. As Joutjärvi is already a Finnish term representing a specific geographical location, there is no need for translation, and it remains the same regardless of the language used. However, if you want to provide more information about Joutjärvi in Finnish, you can certainly consider the following descriptions related to its geography: - Joutjärvi sijaitsee Lahden kaupungissa, Suomessa. (Joutjärvi is located in the city of Lahti, Finland.) - Se on suosittu paikka veneilyyn, kalastukseen ja virkistäytymiseen.

Question: What was the role of the specific person was called out in the lawsuit? Context: On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.","completion":"The role of the specific person called out in the lawsuit, Governor William Milliken, was that he was one of the Michigan state officials being sued by the NAACP for being responsible for de facto public school segregation.

Write an article based on this summary: The UK will accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years, David Cameron has told MPs.","completion":"Title: The United Kingdom's Commitment to Resettling Syrian Refugees: A Beacon of Hope Introduction Since the beginning of the Syrian war in 2011, millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, seeking refuge in neighboring countries and across Europe. As the crisis continues to escalate, many countries have been grappling with the admission of refugees and the most humane ways to address this humanitarian crisis. Amidst the global efforts to resolve this dire situation, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, informed Members of Parliament (MPs) that the UK will accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years. The UK's Refugee Resettlement Commitment This commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees marks a significant shift in the United Kingdom's response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria. Prior to this announcement, the UK had a limited role in welcoming Syrian refugees, mainly focusing on providing financial aid to support the Syrian population and its neighbors. However, increasing public pressure in response to the worsening crisis led to a reassessment of the UK's position, ultimately culminating in the commitment to the resettlement of Syrian refugees. In his announcement, Prime Minister David Cameron emphasized that the UK's focus would be on helping vulnerable refugees directly from camps in countries neighboring Syria. This approach aims to prevent refugees from undertaking hazardous journeys across the Mediterranean, which has resulted in thousands losing their lives. By offering a legal and secure route to the UK, this policy aspires to protect refugees from exploitation by human traffickers and smugglers. The UK's Plan for Resettling Refugees In order to achieve this ambitious goal of resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees, the UK has devised a comprehensive plan involving close collaboration between various stakeholders, including local authorities, the Devolved Administrations, civil society, and the private sector. Some of the key aspects of this plan include: 1. Identifying the most vulnerable refugees: The UK will work closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify and prioritize the most vulnerable refugees for resettlement. This process will involve assessing individuals based on criteria such as medical condition, trauma experienced, risk of persecution, and family composition. 2. Preparing the refugees for life in the UK: Upon selection, refugees will undergo a cultural orientation program to help them understand and adapt to life in the UK. This includes training on the English language, UK culture, and other essential skills for a smooth integration into British society. 3. Providing a comprehensive support system: The UK government is committed to providing a range of support services for resettled refugees, such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment support. This commitment is designed to ensure that refugees not only have a safe place to live but also have the opportunity to become self-reliant and rebuild their lives with dignity. 4. Encouraging community engagement: Local communities, faith-based organizations, and volunteers will play a central role in helping refugees integrate and feel welcome in their new home. This will involve offering social support, practical assistance, and educational resources to ensure a successful resettlement. The Road Ahead While the commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees is a positive step in addressing the humanitarian crisis, there is still much work to be done in order to alleviate the suffering of millions. As the international community continues to grapple with the enormity of the crisis, the United Kingdom's efforts signify a beacon of hope for many who have endured seemingly insurmountable challenges. It remains essential for the global community to continue working together, driven by compassion and a shared sense of responsibility, to find long-lasting solutions for the displaced population of Syria and rebuild their shattered lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys' school. One of the boys, Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, \\"He liked my tits.\\" When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, \\"And have all those gross guys groping me?

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself.

Write an article based on this \\"Those fans of Premier League clubs bemoaning their team's lowly league position or the manager's inactivity in the January transfer window should spare a thought for Hereford United supporters.\\"","completion":"Title: Resilience and Hope: A Note to the Premier League Fans – A Look at Hereford United's Struggles and Collective Support Step 1: starting by introducing the subject matter and setting the context. Article Introduction: As the January transfer window has come to a close, a sense of unrest and disappointment can be found in the conversations of Premier League fans. Their teams' positions in the league or the seemingly inaction of managers has led to a wave of discontent around the football community. However, as fans express frustration about their clubs, perhaps it's time to gain perspective by examining the plight of lower-division clubs, in particular at Hereford United supporters, and the resilience they have shown in the face of adversity. Step 2: highlighting Hereford United's story and their struggles along the way. The History and Struggles of Hereford United: Hereford United is a modest football club from the West Midlands in England that has faced many hardships over the years in comparison to the seemingly trivial troubles of some Premier League clubs. Founded in 1924, the club has experienced a mix of successes and failures alike. From reaching the third tier of English football during their apparent heyday in the 1970s, they have now fallen to the ninth tier and faced dissolution in 2014 due to financial woes. Despite their valiant attempts at revival, Hereford United hasn't quite managed to attain the same heights as its earlier days. Step 3: emphasizing the passion and unwavering support of their fans. The Unyielding Support of Hereford United Fans: It is in these trying times that the Hereford United supporters remain undeterred and steadfast in their love and loyalty for their beloved team. They have continuously been at the club's side, providing integral support and a source of motivation for the players. This unwavering dedication is an inspiration to not only football fans but to the larger sporting community, proving that loyalty doesn't equate to a victorious scoreline but more so lies in the collective experience and camaraderie. Step 4: relating the situation of Hereford United to the overall theme and addressing Premier League fans specifically. A Message to the Premier League Fans: As the January transfer window ends, and many fans are left feeling disillusioned with the club's performance or the manager's supposed inactivity, we draw focus to those who, like Hereford United, are facing far greater challenges. It is crucial to remember and value the privilege that comes with supporting clubs that vie for the prestigious title in the English Premier League, the world's most popular and competitive football league. Those who stand by Hereford United demonstrate the fundamental values of true football fans—loyalty, resilience, and camaraderie. Step 5: concluding the article with a call to reflect and appreciate. In Conclusion: Appreciating the Essence of Football In taking a moment to reflect on the journey of teams like Hereford United and the unwavering support of their fans, we are reminded of the true essence and spirit of football. Before expressing discontent with a team's standing or the manager's decisions, it is worth remembering that there are those who continue to cherish their clubs despite facing uphill battles. Let us celebrate and appreciate not only successes but also the dedication, passion, and unity that sport brings into our lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Now, I have a new situation: Sand mining in the north coastal region was stopped 20 years ago, but it still continues to this day in the south region.

Is \\"A significant difference between the ijāzat al-tadrīs and the licentia docendi was that the former was awarded by the individual scholar-teacher, while the latter was awarded by the chief official of the university, who represented the collective faculty, rather than the individual scholar-teacher.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, the statement provided is accurate in highlighting the key differences between the ijāzat al-tadrīs in Islamic schools and the licentia docendi in European universities. To further elaborate on this topic, let us explore the contexts and processes of obtaining these teaching licenses in both Islamic and European educational systems. In Islamic Schools: The ijāzat al-tadrīs (permission to teach) was a teaching license granted in Islamic schools and institutions, particularly in madrasas, which were centers of learning for various subjects such as law, theology, philosophy, and sciences. This license played an essential role in the educational system of the Islamic world, as it validated the scholarly qualifications of the recipient and allowed them to impart knowledge to students. The process of obtaining an ijāzat al-tadrīs was not standardized or institutionalized, and it varied depending on the scholar, subject, and the period. Generally, students studied under the guidance of one or more scholars, usually by attending their lectures and engaging in discussions. After a significant amount of time and demonstrating proficiency in a particular subject, the student could request the ijāzat al-tadrīs from their teacher. The teacher, acting in their capacity as an individual scholar, would then decide whether to grant the license based on their assessment of the student's qualifications. Once granted, the ijāzat al-tadrīs would usually be documented in a written certificate or ijāza. The document often included the name of the recipient, the subject or field of study, the name of the scholar issuing the license, and sometimes even the names of previous scholars in the chain of transmission, establishing the teacher's scholarly lineage. With this license, the recipient was authorized to teach the specific subject referenced in the ijāza within the Islamic educational system. In European Universities: The licentia docendi, or the permission to teach, was a teaching license granted in medieval European universities. The process of obtaining this license was more formalized and institutionalized compared to the ijāzat al-tadrīs. Rather than being solely determined by an individual scholar-teacher, the licentia docendi was conferred by the chief official of the university, who represented the institution and the collective faculty. This process was an integral part of the rigorous academic structure that had developed in European universities at the time. To obtain a licentia docendi, a candidate would typically have to complete an extensive course of studies at a university, specializing in a subject such as theology, law, medicine, or arts. The candidate would then go through a series of examinations or disputations to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. Upon successful completion of the rigorous examination process, the candidate would receive the licentia docendi, granted by the university authority on behalf of the institution and the collective faculty. In conclusion, while both the ijāzat al-tadrīs and the licentia docendi served as teaching licenses in the Islamic and European educational systems, respectively, their processes and contexts differed significantly. The ijāzat al-tadrīs relied on the individual scholar-teacher's judgment in assessing a candidate's qualifications, whereas the licentia docendi was based on a collective decision made by the university officials, representing the institutional subject matter experts and faculties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Behind the First Presidential Trip There When U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Japan on Thursday, as part of week-long trip to Asia, he will be on his way to becoming the first U.S. President to visit the city of Hiroshima, the site of the world’s first atomic attack in 1945. The emotionally charged event will build on the precedent set by President Gerald Ford’s visit to the East Asian country in the 1974, when he became the first U.S. President to visit Japan since that bombing killed more than 60 thousand people—and, in fact, the first ever to make an official visit to that nation. Ford’s trip in November of 1974 was his first one abroad as President since replacing Richard Nixon earlier that year. Dwight Eisenhower had planned to over a decade before, but that trip had been cancelled due to unrest by Japanese leftists over the continued military presence of the U.S. in the country. As TIME reported in 1974, there remained a fear that such groups would do their utmost to disrupt Ford’s trip: In 1960 the mammoth anti-American demonstrations were spearheaded by the Zengakuren, a tautly disciplined, powerful army of leftist students. The Zengakuren have since faded out of existence as those members who did not entirely forsake radical politics turned to terrorism. Now the leftists have splintered into numerous tiny and not very effective groups. Aside from staging an occasional bombing, they spend most their time in internecine street fighting Some regard themselves as Maoists, others call themselves “Guevarristas”; one organization, the “East Asian Anti-Japanese Armed Front,” seems primarily to oppose what it calls “a new brand of Japanese colonialism,” meaning Japanese business activities in Asia. With that in mind, the Japanese government had 10 thousand policeman assigned to protect the President. This was in addition to 40 Secret Service men who scrutinized Ford’s planned itinerary, vetoing anything that was deemed “too dangerous”—like an exhibition baseball game between the New York Mets and a Japanese team. MORE: Why It Took So Long for a U.S. President to Visit Hiroshima At the time, both Ford and the Japanese Premier Kakuei Tanaka were struggling with mounting criticism of their leadership around the planned visit. Ford’s first months of presidency had been “blighted by raging inflation, deepening recession and…growing doubts about his ability to lead the nation,” TIME reported, while across the Pacific, Tanaka was already struggling with rebellion in his own political party, recession, inflation and an energy crisis when, that fall, a magazine accused him of “corrupt financial dealings and tax evasion.” On Nov. 18, 1974, Ford’s Air Force One landed in Tokyo’s Haneda International airport. The president met with Emperor Hirohito before attending a formal banquet at the Imperial Palace on the following day. Ford also held talks with Tanaka about trade policy, mutual defense arrangements, “relations with Communist China, inflation and the energy crisis.” As TIME reported: In addition, Tanaka sought a promise that the U.S. would not restrict food sales to Japan in the future, while Ford hoped to receive assurances that the Japanese Diet would ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. After reciprocating with a dinner for Hirohito, Tanaka and other Japanese dignitaries on Wednesday evening, Ford planned to spend the next day touring Kyoto, Japan’s ancient capital and one of its most beautiful cities. Towards the end of his trip, he made a speech at Japan Press Club, where he celebrated the alliance between the two nations and the success they had experienced at moving beyond the legacy of World War II. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter “I hope that my visit shall be the first of many by American Presidents,” Ford said. “I hope that the leaders of our two countries will follow the example that our peoples have already set, to visit each other frequently and freely as our nations move together to deal with the many common problems and concerns that will affect the lives of all our citizens and all humanity.”","completion":"US President Barack Obama is set to become the first US President to visit Hiroshima, the site of the world's first atomic bomb attack in 1945.

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Key village presented higher levels of both indoor and outdoor pollution. But I can use this background: Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. What is an answer for this question: Which village had a lower level of air pollutants? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Auburn village had a lower level of air pollutants than Key village. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Key village presented higher levels of both indoor and outdoor pollution. Consequently, it is expected that residents of Auburn village would be exposed to lesser air pollutants and may have a reduced risk of associated health issues as compared to Key village residents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further.

Plot: Act 1: In the small, tight-knit town of Shadow Hollow, Lars, a young and optimistic man, lives a relatively peaceful life with his trusted canine companion, Daisy. Little does he know that the town's dark past is about to affect his own life in inexplicable ways. After a series of unusual events in the surrounding woods, Lars comes home to a harrowing scene: his beloved dog, Daisy, is found dead, with an unrecognizable, horrifying creature looming over her body. Before Lars can react, the creature disappears into the woods, leaving no trace behind. The townspeople, familiar with strange and dark legends surrounding Shadow Hollow, refuse to speak about the incident, instilling fear and mistrust among the community. Devastated, Lars swears to uncover the truth behind what killed Daisy and aims to bring peace to Shadow Hollow. With the hesitant and cryptic help of a local historian, Charlotte, who shares a personal connection to this malevolent presence, he begins researching the history of the town and the legends surrounding it. Act 2: They discover a series of tragic events from the past involving the disappearance or death of beloved pets, all linked to the strange Shadow Hollow woods. Boldly venturing into the woods to seek answers, Lars and Charlotte encounter the otherworldly creature – a nightmarish, shape-shifting being that feeds on fear and suffering. Realization dawns on Lars and Charlotte that the creature has been terrorizing the town for decades. Determined to stop the curse and exact vengeance, Lars seeks guidance from a knowledgeable mystic who reveals the sinister truth behind the curse: in the depths of Shadow Hollow forest resides an ancient tree, binding the creature to the town. Destruction of the tree would break the curse, and release the creature from its imprisonment. As Lars and Charlotte divulge their findings to the townspeople, they finally garner support from a small group of courageous residents to confront the creature and end the curse once and for all. Act 3: Lars, Charlotte, and the townspeople venture into the mystifying woods of Shadow Hollow, armed with the knowledge and means to break the curse. Along the way, they experience eerie anamolies and near-death encounters, attacking their emotional vulnerabilities and testing their strength and will. Finally arriving at the ancient tree, the group battles the creature in a climactic showdown, revealing its true form as a manifestation of the town's collective fear and guilt over past tragedies. Lars courageously confronts the creature, reaffirming the power of love and unity against fear and suffering. In an emotionally-charged sequence, Lars cuts down the ancient tree, breaking the curse and freeing the creature from its immortal prison. The townspeople watch in awe as the creature dissolves into the night, redeeming the tortured souls lost to its malice over the decades. The town of Shadow Hollow, now unshackled, returns to relative peace, with the residents more united than ever before. As the community gathers to memorialize the lost pets and rediscover hope, Lars finds comfort in his new friendship with Charlotte, who adopts a new stray dog in need of a loving home. Together, they honor Daisy's memory and embark on new adventures, with a renewed sense of unity and understanding in their once cursed town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, what's the best answer to the question? Possible answers: [1]. Heat. [2]. toxins. [3]. Cars. [4]. Gas. [5]. h2o. [6]. tar. [7]. Carbon. [8]. energy.","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas is burned?\\" would be carbon dioxide. However, this option is not explicitly listed among the given possible answers. In such cases, it is essential to select the closest and most accurate answer that aligns with the hints received. Given the teacher's hints, the two primary clues are: 1) burning fossil fuels increases the carbon in the atmosphere, and 2) carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Combining these two hints, we can deduce that the byproduct of burning fossil fuels is related to carbon enrichment in the atmosphere. Close examination of the provided possible answers reveals that answer choice [7]. Carbon is the choice that most closely aligns with the hints given by the teacher. While the answer is not outright \\"carbon dioxide,\\" it is crucial to understand that carbon is the primary element in carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, when fossil fuels are combusted, the carbon within them combines with oxygen from the air to form carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere. In summary, though the optimal answer, \\"carbon dioxide,\\" is not explicitly listed, the best answer available from the given choices is [7]. Carbon. This choice serves as an approximation of the correct response based on the information the teacher provided that connects the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas with the increase of carbon in the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tanya wanted to microwave the food.","completion":"b. Tanya wanted to microwave the food. Angela enjoyed cooking homemade meals more than Tanya, so it's evident that Angela had a greater affinity for preparing food from scratch, taking the time to select her ingredients, chop, stir, mix, and cook, ultimately creating a delicious and fulfilling meal for herself and others. Angela likely found joy in crafting flavor combinations, testing new recipes, and taking pride in her culinary skills. She was a strong believer in the advantages of home cooking, such as the ability to control ingredients and ensure a nutritious, well-balanced meal. Additionally, Angela probably enjoyed the sensory experience of creating a dish from raw ingredients, which allowed her to connect with her food on a deeper level. On the other hand, Tanya preferred the ease and convenience of microwaving food. While Tanya may have appreciated the taste of homemade meals, she did not share Angela's passion for cooking and found it more practical and time-saving to opt for pre-made or packaged meals that could be heated quickly in a microwave. This approach allowed her to avoid the laborious process of food preparation, cleaning, and cooking from scratch. Microwaving food might have been a more appealing option for Tanya, especially during busy days or when she wasn't in the mood to spend a considerable amount of time in the kitchen. Tanya's choice to microwave food rather than cook homemade meals may be attributed to various factors, such as her lifestyle, work schedule, and personal priorities. While both methods of food preparation have their merits and disadvantages, it is clear that Angela and Tanya's preferences are distinct, ultimately showcasing the diverse ways individuals approach cooking and consuming food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -270*n + 2382*n + 86215 = 107*n for n, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable n. -270n and 2382n are on the same side, so we can combine them: 2382n - 270n = 2112n. Now, the equation looks like this: 2112*n + 86215 = 107*n. Step 2: Move the terms with n to one side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 107n from both sides of the equation: 2112n - 107n = 2005n. Now, the equation looks like this: 2005*n + 86215 = 0. Step 3: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 86215 from both sides of the equation: 2005n - 86215 = -86215. Now, the equation looks like this: 2005*n = -86215. Step 4: Solve for n. To find the value of n, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2005: n = -86215 / 2005.

De Rust is located at the foot of the Swartberg Mountain range between Oudtshoorn and Beaufort West . De Rust is also known for the meandering Meiringspoort pass . Meiringspoort is a gateway that connects the Klein Karoo ( little Karoo ) and the ( great ) Karoo through a gorge with a 25 km road crossing the same river 25 times in the span of the 25 km. This area is also well known for ostrich farming and most of the farmers in the area either farm exclusively with ostriches or as a sideline to their existing farming . - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - The Karoo (; from a Khoikhoi word, possibly \\"garo\\" \\"desert\\") is a semi-desert natural region of South Africa. There is no exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo, and therefore its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo is partly defined by its topography, geology, and climate above all, its low rainfall, arid air, cloudless skies, and extremes of heat and cold. The Karoo also hosted a well-preserved ecosystem hundreds of million years ago which is now represented by many fossils. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf. I told him that I appreciated the call, but he wasn’t the one who needed to apologize. Peace Why was the writer attacked? - not enough information - Because the writer antagonized the dogs. - Because the dogs were mad. - Because the woman set him up to be attacked.","completion":"To complete the task of identifying why the writer was attacked, I will analyze the information provided in the story. 1.

The client knew the writer was coming over and admitted that she wanted to see what would happen. 4. The writer was attacked when he came near the dogs after they had gotten the steak bone. From the above points, it becomes clear that the writer was attacked because the woman (the client) set him up to be attacked.

The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

Make this proper case.","completion":"Defending one's position as a turret while blasting the incoming waves is an exciting challenge, one that requires a combination of strategic thinking, resource management, and quick reflexes. As wave after wave of enemies approach, it is essential to develop a comprehensive strategy that will help you not only hold your ground but also thrive throughout the battle. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps you should take to be successful as a turret: 1. Assessment: Begin by assessing the situation and understanding the environment around you. Take note of choke points, blind spots, and any other tactics you might use to your advantage. It's crucial to have a clear idea of the landscape so that you can anticipate the movements and strategies of your enemies. 2. Prioritization: Analyze the different types of incoming enemies and prioritize your targets. Defend against those that pose the biggest threat to your turret or allies. Be even more effective by discerning any weaknesses your enemies might have and exploiting them. 3. Positioning: As a turret, your positioning is critical to your success. Find an optimal location that maximizes your firing range, provides cover from enemy fire, and allows for potential escape routes in case of emergencies. Ensure that your flanks and rear are secure from any surprise attacks. 4. Upgrades: Upgrade your turret whenever possible, whether by finding power-ups on the field or accumulating enough resources. Focus on improving your firepower, defensive capabilities, and the range and accuracy of your shots. Don't forget to allocate resources towards unlocking new abilities and expanding your arsenal. 5. Communication: If you are part of a team, establish clear communication channels with your allies. Share information about enemy movements, potential threats, and any opportunities that may arise during battle. This fosters a sense of collaboration and helps create a well-coordinated defense. 6. Adaptation: As the battle progresses, continually reassess the situation and adapt your strategy. Engage new enemies, shift your position if necessary, and take advantage of any opportunities that may arise. Be prepared for the unexpected and don't become complacent. 7. Self-preservation: Staying alive is paramount. Regularly check your health and ammunition levels, and retreat if necessary to find cover and replenish your supplies. Remember, you cannot defend as a turret if you are destroyed! By following these steps and honing your defensive skills, you will become an unstoppable force as a turret while facing incoming waves. Continuously upgrading yourself and staying adaptable will ensure your survival in these intense battles. So, take a deep breath, find your focus, and hold your ground as an unyielding pillar of defense."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).

Step 2: Research Queen Elizabeth II's badass qualities I will explore Queen Elizabeth II's biography and history to identify her most exceptional or impressive accomplishments or qualities. From my knowledge and research, the most badass thing about Queen Elizabeth II is her strong leadership and unwavering dedication to her duties as a monarch. She has been the longest-reigning Queen in British history, having ascended to the throne in 1952 and continues to serve to this day, facing various challenges and modernizations during her reign. Notably, she served as a mechanic and truck driver in the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service during WWII, showing her courage and commitment. Step 3: Research John F. Kennedy's badass qualities I will explore John F. Kennedy's biography and history to identify his most exceptional or impressive accomplishments or qualities. From my knowledge and research, the most badass thing about John F. Kennedy is his actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis. As the US president, he successfully navigated the world through the crisis, which was one of the deadliest confrontations during the Cold War era. His strong leadership, diplomacy, and ability to make difficult decisions led to the de-escalation of the conflict and prevented a potential nuclear war. Step 4: Compare the questions and determine if they are the same The original questions ask about the most badass thing about two different individuals, Queen Elizabeth II and John F. Kennedy. Although both questions focus on identifying an exceptional or impressive quality or action, each question pertains to a different person and context: one being a monarch with a long reign and the other being a president who faced a significant international crisis. Therefore, I would say that these questions are not the same, as they ask about two distinct individuals with different roles, contexts, and accomplishments. However, they are similar in that they both request identification of a badass, or exceptional, quality or action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This is done to isolate the term with the variable (in this case, -7*v) on one side of the equation. 26 - 40 = -7*v + 40 - 40 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. After subtracting 40 from both sides, the equation becomes: -14 = -7*v Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -7. Now, we need to get v alone on the right side. To do this, divide both sides by -7 (because -7 is multiplied by v, we need to do the opposite operation, which is division). (-14) / (-7) = (-7*v) / (-7) Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. Dividing -14 by -7 equals 2, and dividing -7 * v by -7 equals v. So the equation becomes: 2 = v The solution to the math problem is v = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a letter to the United Nations, North Korea's UN ambassador, Ja Song Nam, states that the joint military exercises have created \\"the worst ever situation\\" in the region. Step 1: Explain the deployment of US aircraft carriers The US has deployed three aircraft carrier groups around the Korean peninsula, which have been participating in a joint exercise with South Korea. This comes during President Donald Trump's visit to Asia, and marks the first time since 2007 that so many carrier groups have operated together in the western Pacific. Step 2: Discuss North Korea's reaction North Korea has reacted aggressively, with Ja Song Nam expressing his concern in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres. He believes that this unprecedented military show of force makes it impossible to predict when nuclear war might break out. Furthermore, he adds that these joint exercises are creating the most precarious situation the region has ever faced. Step 3: Detail the escalated military situation around the Korean Peninsula Ja Song Nam also remarks on the US's renewed round-the-clock sorties with nuclear-capable B-52 strategic bombers, a throwback to Cold War times. The North Korean ambassador cites these \\"large-scale nuclear war exercises and blackmails\\" as justification for their own nuclear pursuits, concluding that their chosen path is the \\"right one\\" and commits to following it to the end. Step 4: Mention recent tensions between Trump and Kim Jong Un This development comes on the heels of a recent back-and-forth between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump has insinuated that Kim insulted him by calling him \\"old,\\" and tensions between the two nations remain palpable. Conclusion: The latest military developments have the potential to further strain relations between North Korea and the US. Both sides continue to escalate their rhetoric, as the potential for a full-blown conflict grows.

On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her.

I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out.

Called Target Ticket beta (find it at www.targetticket.com/home/beta), the service claims to offer “instant access to 15,000 titles, new releases, classic movies and next-day TV.” The site requires a Target employee login to use. The Target website says users can either stream or download movies (streaming video is not stored on a computer’s hard drive, and thus can be watched instantly instead of after a lengthy download.) Target on Thursday acknowledged it was testing the video service with its employees, but provided no details. Target is late to a market that’s domi­nated by Netflix, but its test comes at a time when video streaming is rapidly becoming a challenger to broadcast and cable TV. Streaming video now accounts for more than 68 percent of the data traffic from the Internet to users during peak Internet use periods, according to an online trends report issued earlier this week by Canadian computer networking firm Sandvine Inc. That’s up from 65 percent six months ago, Sandvine said. Netflix, which received a publicity boost from its “House of Cards” series starring Kevin Spacey, continues to be the unchallenged leader, accounting for just under one-third of all video streaming traffic during peak periods, Sandvine said. YouTube is a distant second with 17.1 percent, followed by Hulu with 2.4 percent, Sandvine said. Target is not the first retailer to try streaming video. Wal-Mart entered the market in 2010 by acquiring the Vudu video streaming service, which today, Wal-Mart says, offers “thousands of movies instantly.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"Target, a big store, is trying something new!

If I tell you that Sheep can feed at more than one trophic level, and ask you the question \\"what can feed at more than one trophic level?\\", is the correct answer \\"sheep\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, based on the information you provided, the correct answer would be \\"sheep.\\" This is because you have specifically mentioned that sheep can feed at more than one trophic level. Feeding at multiple trophic levels implies that sheep obtain their nutrients and energy from various types of sources in a food chain, such as primary producers (plants) and primary consumers (herbivores). To further explain this concept, let's delve deeper into trophic levels and their importance in ecological systems. Trophic levels are the various positions within a food chain or food web, where organisms obtain energy and nutrients. In general, there are four main trophic levels: 1. Primary producers (autotrophs): These are organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis or other means. They convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, which serves as an energy source for other organisms. Examples of primary producers include plants, algae, and some bacteria. 2. Primary consumers (herbivores): These organisms feed on primary producers to obtain energy and nutrients. Herbivores are animals that consume plant matter, such as leaves, fruits, seeds, or nectar. Examples of primary consumers include insects like caterpillars, herbivorous mammals like deer, and herbivorous birds like the American goldfinch. 3. Secondary consumers (carnivores): These organisms feed on animals that consume primary producers. They obtain energy and nutrients from primary consumers, which are usually herbivores. Carnivores come in various forms and sizes, from small insects like ladybugs to large mammals like lions. 4. Tertiary consumers (top carnivores): These are organisms that feed on other carnivores in a food chain. They are often referred to as top predators because they usually do not have any natural predators in their ecosystem. Examples of tertiary consumers include eagles, wolves, and sharks. In the case of sheep, they predominantly feed on plant matter such as grass, making them primary consumers (herbivores); however, if they were to feed at more than one trophic level, they would also consume organisms other than plants. This flexibility in their diet could be attributed to the consumption of insects present in their grazing areas or other supplements provided by their caretakers. As a result, they would obtain nutrients and energy from both primary producers (plants) and primary consumers (in this context, insects), qualifying them as organisms that can feed at more than one trophic level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I is Philip the Good. The woman married to Maximilian I is Mary of Burgundy, and she is the granddaughter of Philip the Good, who was a significant patron of illuminated manuscripts and an influential figure in the development of the Netherlandish illuminators' tradition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - In Greco-Roman mythology, Aeneas (Greek: , \\"Aineías\\", possibly derived from Greek meaning \\"praised\\") was a Trojan hero, the son of the prince Anchises and the goddess Venus (Aphrodite). His father was a first cousin of King Priam of Troy (both being grandsons of Ilus, founder of Troy), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's children (such as Hector and Paris). He is a character in Greek mythology and is mentioned in Homer's \\"Iliad\\". Aeneas receives full treatment in Roman mythology, most extensively in Virgil's \\"Aeneid,\\" where he is an ancestor of Romulus and Remus. He became the first true hero of Rome. Snorri Sturlason identifies him with the Norse Æsir Vidarr. - Publius Vergilius Maro (traditional dates October 15, 70 BC September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him. - Alba Longa (occasionally written Albalonga in Italian sources) was an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, southeast of Rome, in the Alban Hills. Founder and head of the Latin League, it was destroyed by Rome around the middle of the 7th century BC. In legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, had come from the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, which in Virgil's Aeneid had been the bloodline of Aeneas, a son of Venus. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Procas or Proca (said to have reigned 817-794 BC) was one of the Latin kings of Alba Longa in the mythic tradition of the founding of Rome. He was the father of Amulius and Numitor and the great grandfather of Romulus and Remus, Rome's legendary founders.. - Aventinus ( said to have reigned 854 - 817 BC ) , one of the mythical kings of Alba Longa , who was buried on the Aventine Hill later named after him . He is said to have reigned thirty - seven years , and to have been succeeded by Procas , the father of Amulius . Servius , in analysing Virgil 's Aeneid , Book vii. 656 , speaks of an Aventinus , a king of the aboriginal inhabitants of Rome , who was killed and buried on the hill afterwards called the Aventine Hill . This king may be conflated with this one or with a separate figure in the Aeneid : \`\` The Aventine is a hill in the city of Rome . It is accepted that it derives its name from birds ( aves ) which , rising from the Tiber , nested there ( as we read in the eighth book of a suitable home for the nests of ill - omened birds ) . This is because of a king of the Aboriginal Italians , Aventinus by name , who was both killed and buried there - just as the Alban king Aventinus was , he who was succeeded by Procas . Varro , however , states that amongst the Roman people , the Sabines accepted this mountain when it was offered them by Romulus , and called it the Aventine after the Aventus river in its area . It is therefore accepted that these different opinions came later , for in the beginning it was called Aventinus after either the birds or the Aboriginal King : from which it is accepted that the son of Hercules mentioned here took his name from that of the hill , not vice versa . '' - In Roman mythology, King Numitor of Alba Longa, was the son of Procas, descendant of Aeneas the Trojan, and father of Rhea Silvia and Lausus - In Roman mythology, Amulius was king of Alba Longa who ordered the death of his infant, twin grandnephews Romulus, the eventual founder and king of Rome, and Remus. He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood. - The King of Rome was the chief magistrate of the Roman Kingdom. According to legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city in 753 BC upon the Palatine Hill.

Context: The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.

Who was the only President of the Confederate States of the USA?","completion":"The only President of the Confederate States of America was Jefferson Finis Davis. Born on June 3, 1808, in Kentucky, Davis played a crucial role in the formation and governance of the Confederate States during the American Civil War. Before his tenure as the Confederate President, Davis gained a wealth of political experience and military background. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1828 and went on to serve in the United States Army, participating in the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. His military service culminated with his promotion to the rank of Colonel. Politically, Davis held numerous positions throughout his career. He represented Mississippi in the United States House of Representatives from 1845 to 1846, and later, he served as a United States Senator from Mississippi between 1857 to 1861. His political journey also included a brief stint as the United States Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce, from 1853 to 1857, where he gained valuable exposure to military organization and strategies. As tensions between the Northern and Southern states grew over issues such as state sovereignty, economics, and, most significantly, slavery, Davis became a prominent figure advocating for Southern interests. When the Confederate States of America formed following the secession of eleven Southern states from the United States, Davis was selected as their provisional President by a congress of delegates on February 9, 1861. Later, on November 6, 1861, he was elected as the President of the Confederacy for a six-year term. During his presidency, Davis faced numerous challenges. He had to create a new government, establish diplomatic relations, build a military, and manage an economy based largely on agriculture and trade—all while waging a war against the much larger and better-equipped Union Army. Despite difficulties and internal strife, he remained committed to his cause until the very end of the Civil War. In April 1865, after the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, was captured by Union forces, Davis was forced to flee, and he was eventually captured in Georgia on May 10, 1865. He was imprisoned for two years before being released on bail, and the government eventually dropped their charges against him. Jefferson Davis continued to be active in various capacities after his release; he first worked as the president of an insurance company and later authored his memoir, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.\\" He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. As the only President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis played a pivotal role in shaping the course of the American Civil War and the history of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Output: Although the sentences are similar and share some key phrases, the difference in focus (specific start date vs. avoiding a lapse) leads me to conclude that they are not perfect paraphrases of each other: No"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Galaxy IV was a model HS - 601 satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications Company ( HSC ) . The satellite , which carried a payload of both C band and Ku band transponders , was launched on June 24 , 1993 and operated by PanAmSat Corporation . Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space . - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet.

The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films. - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals. - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace. - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth.

Help as much as you can. Background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Paragraph: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops.

Q: what is the largest fish in the amazon? A:","completion":"The largest fish in the Amazon is the Arapaima, also referred to as the Pirarucu or Paiche. It is a colossal creature whose size and weight are unmatched by any other fish species found in the Amazon. Arapaima's size is significant and it's quite magnificent and captivating not just due to its size but due to multiple other reasons as well. It can grow up to 10 feet long and can weigh as much as 440 pounds, making it one of the largest freshwater fish in the world. Moreover, its scale is also a standout as it boasts a vibrant color that shines even in the murky waters of the Amazon, making it easier for fishermen to spot it. Interestingly, Arapaima is an air-breathing fish that has adapted to water with little dissolved oxygen. It has a modified and vast swim bladder, which opens into the fish’s mouth and operates as lungs. This allows the fish to swim up to the surface and gulp air, surviving in oxygen-depleted waters where other fish wouldn’t stand a chance. One of the striking things about Arapaima is their feeding strategy. They primarily feed on fish but also eat fruits, seeds, and insects. It uses the strategy of gulping its prey together with a large volume of water in a single huge suction. When prey is near, the Arapaima opens its large mouth causing a sudden rush of water into its mouth which almost immediately floods back out, taking the prey with it. The majority of Arapaima are found in the central Amazon River basin, in the countries of Brazil, Guyana, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. They are, however, also reported from near-coastal rivers and associated floodplain habitats, such as swamps and lagoons. The Arapaima is utilized for human consumption throughout its range and is an important part of local subsistence fisheries. Commercially, the fish is often targeted for its meat, scales, and for use in the ornamental fish trade. Despite its ecological importance and contribution to local livelihoods, the Arapaima is currently considered threatened due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Significant efforts are being made towards their conservation, incorporating strict fishing regulations, habitat preservation, and captive breeding programs. Therefore, the sheer size and unique survival adaptations of the Arapaima not only make it the largest fish in the Amazon but also a fascinating creature to study, providing a glimpse into the rich biodiversity of the Amazonian ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear.

Relevant experience is a significant factor in developing these knowledge, skills, and abilities. The premise establishes that all OSI work is conducted by personnel who collectively possess the required expertise for their tasks and exercise due professional care. This indicates a focus on the quality and thoroughness of the work being performed. Relevant experience serves as evidence of an individual's ability to meet these standards, as it provides insight into their previous engagement in similar work and their proficiency in the tasks at hand. When individuals have relevant experience, it is more likely they are familiar with the industry, the technology, methodologies, and best practices involved in the work. They will have had the chance to develop problem-solving skills, understand potential obstacles, and know how to navigate them. These acquired skills and knowledge increase the likelihood of successful OSI work and the integration's overall effectiveness. Moreover, personnel with relevant experience are more likely to exercise due professional care, as mentioned in the premise. Professional care implies that individuals demonstrate a commitment to quality, efficiency, and ethical behavior in their work. Experienced professionals are expected to have cultivated a deeper understanding of these principles and apply them effectively in their tasks. In conclusion, based on the premise's emphasis on personnel possessing the required knowledge, skills, and abilities, and exercising due professional care, it is reasonable to derive the hypothesis that personnel performing OSI work must have relevant experience.

Write highlights for this article: Ernst Hess, Adolf Hitler's company commander in WWI, who was, despite his Jewish roots, spared from the genocide unleashed by the Nazis. Some German Jews escaped the Holocaust by fleeing the country, others hid and some battled to stay alive long enough to be freed from the Nazi death camps. But Ernst Hess owed his survival to the personal intervention of Adolf Hitler. The Fuhrer ordered his SS thugs to leave the Jewish judge alone because Hess had been his commanding officer during the First World War. Hitler looked back on his time on the Western Front with great pride and fondness so, while some six million Jews perished in the Holocaust set in motion by Hitler, Hess was allowed to live on the Fuhrer's whim. His remarkable story was told by his daughter Ursula, 86, after a newspaper unearthed the letter sent on the orders of Hitler insisting that Hess was not to be 'persecuted or deported'. A file kept by the Dusseldorf Gestapo on him includes the letter from the head of the Gestapo and the SS, Heinrich Himmler, dated August 27, 1940, saying Hess must receive 'relief and protection as per the Fuhrer's wishes'. Himmler made a point of informing all relevant authorities and officials that the judge was 'not to be inopportuned in any way whatsoever'. Ironically, Hess told his daughter that he and his old comrades from the trenches hardly remembered Hitler – by then a well-known figure in German politics – when they met at reunions in the 1920s and 30s. He told her that the future dictator rarely spoke and had few friends among the troops. Historians have in recent years poured scorn on the Nazi myth of the heroic Corporal Hitler running messages from one frontline trench to another. In fact, other soldiers regarded him as a 'rear area pig', taking his messages between HQs a few miles behind the front. Ernst Moritz Hess, born in 1890, had joined the 2nd Royal Bavarian Reserve Infantry as an officer at the beginning of the First World War, the same regiment that Austrian-born Hitler volunteered for. Both men were deployed to the Flanders front in autumn 1914, serving in what was known as the List Regiment until 1918. Hess was seriously wounded in October of 1914 and again two years later in October 1916. In the summer of that year, the highly decorated officer had temporarily been Hitler's company commander. Although baptised a protestant, his mother was Jewish and the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935, introduced by the Nazis, classified him as a 'full blooded Jew'. Hess, standing far right, with his unit during the Great War. Hitler (pictured far right) and Hess were both deployed to the Flanders front in the fall of 1914, serving in what was known as the 'List Regiment' until 1918.

Hitler pictured in 1934. He remembered his time in the army fondly and was proud of his service in the war. Hess was forced by the laws to quit. his post as a judge in 1936. His family saw him being beaten up outside. his house by Nazi thugs the same year. He had petitioned Hitler in June of 1936 asking for an exception to be made for him and his daughter under the race laws. In his letter Hess said: 'For us, it is a kind of spiritual death to now be branded as Jews and exposed to general contempt.' Hess ended up as a slave labourer,. building barracks. This time he escaped extermination because of his. 'privileged miscegenated marriage' to Margarete Hess, a Protestant. His sister Berta was gassed at Auschwitz, wrongly believing that the protection afforded to her brother extended to her. Hess died in Frankfurt after a successful career in post-war West Germany on September 14, 1983. Hess moved his family to Bolzano,. Italy in October 1937, but was forced to return in 1939. Hoping that. his connections to Hitler would keep him safe, he moved his family to a. remote Bavarian village in mid-1940. A copy of the letter Himmler sent to. the Gestapo in Dusseldorf was given to him. But in late June 1941, Hess. was summoned to appear before the SS in Munich. When he submitted his letter of. protection it was taken from him and he was told it had been revoked in. May of 1941, and that he was now 'a Jew like any other'.

There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The \\"Tathāgatagarbha Sutras\\" are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Even though this collection was generally ignored in India, East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts. Answer:","completion":"The idea that can be traced to Abhidharma and to Buddha in the Nikayes is the concept of tathāgatagarbha, or Buddha-nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: An 18-year-old man who was allowed to get on a flight at Edmonton International Airport in September after he was caught bringing a pipe bomb to security has been sentenced for possession of an explosive device.​ Skylar Vincent Murphy was caught with the pipe bomb on Sept. 20. Security took the explosive away, but Murphy was given the go-ahead to continue on his flight. Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) alerted RCMP to the case four days later. Murphy was arrested by Leduc RCMP on Sept. 27. In an email response to questions from CBC News, CATSA spokesman Mathieu Larocque did not address why Murphy was allowed to get on the plane. \\"Screening officers do not have the authority to apprehend or detain passengers,\\" he wrote. \\"When they see something potentially illegal, the(y) contact the police.\\" On Dec. 5, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year probation and a 100 fine. He is also prohibited from possessing explosives, firearms or ammunition for one year, and must also make a 500 donation to the University of Alberta burn unit. ||||| CTVNews.ca Staff A man who had a pipe bomb in his carry-on bag was still allowed to board his international flight from Edmonton last fall, even after screening officers seized the explosive device from him. Skylar Murphy, 18, pleaded guilty last month to possession of an explosive substance in connection with the September incident at the Edmonton International Airport. He was sentenced to a year of probation and fined 100. When screening officers found what court documents describe as black powder and a pipe bomb inside the passenger’s carry-on bag on Sept. 20, 2013, they seized the suspicious items but still allowed him to board an international flight. It wasn’t until four days later that Canada’s Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) called the RCMP. Three days after that, on Sept. 27, Murphy was arrested upon his return to Canada. CATSA would not reveal his travel destination. CATSA is also not saying why the passenger was allowed to get on his flight and why it took so long to notify police. “CATSA screening officers do not have the authority to apprehend or detain passengers,” spokesperson Mathieu Larocque said. He also told CTV News that, “for security reasons, I can’t go into details about our procedures at the checkpoint, which include our protocols with the police. “Incidents that occur at our checkpoints are constantly being reviewed. We are constantly reviewing and updating our procedures and training to ensure that screening officers are equipped to handle all sorts of security situations.” Murphy has declined comment. One security expert, Andre Gerolymatos of Simon Fraser University, said it appears that “everyone is dodging the bullet” in this case. “No one wants to take responsibility for what is obviously a series of mistakes.” He also said the incident defies logic. “If a person is carrying an explosive device in their carry-on, they should not be allowed to board the airplane. That is just common sense.” With a report from CTV’s Alberta Bureau Chief Janet Dirks ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In September 2013, an 18-year-old man named Skylar Vincent Murphy was allowed to board a flight at Edmonton International Airport despite being caught with a pipe bomb in his possession.

Question: Information: - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Augustus \`\` Gussie '' Clarke ( born 1953 ) is a reggae producer who worked with some of the top Jamaican reggae artists in the 1970s and later set up his own Music Works studio . - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David (Will McMillan), his girlfriend, nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), and firefighter Clank (Harold Wayne Jones). David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks, arrive in town, led by Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon crash-landed in the hills near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie,\\" causing victims to either die or become homicidal. \\"Trixie\\" is highly contagious, with anyone drinking from the Evans City reservoir becoming affected. In Washington D.C., government officials order Colonel Peckem (Lloyd Hollar) to go to Evans City to help contain the virus, while scientist Dr. Watts (Richard France), arrives to develop a cure before the virus spreads beyond the small town. Officials also deploy bombers armed with nuclear weapons, to destroy the town, if necessary. Mayhem begins when the Army quarantines the town, shooting anyone attempting to escape. The soldiers move the townspeople into the high school, and chaos happens when the sheriff (Robert Karlowsky) is shot with his own pistol. While the townspeople are being rousted from their homes, a soldier encounters a quiet elderly woman. He kindly urges the woman to come with him, but she stabs him with her knitting needle.

Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition.

The tweet says, \\"@radsnowgirl I hope not.\\" There is no clear context provided, but we can still analyze the message. In this tweet, the sentiment seems to hinge upon the phrase \\"I hope not.\\" \\"Hope\\" is generally considered to be a positive word since it implies optimism and the desire for a favorable outcome. However, the inclusion of \\"not\\" changes the dynamic and might indicate a desire to avoid a negative outcome. So, while \\"hope\\" conveys optimism, the overall sentiment of the tweet can be interpreted as negative since it implies that the tweeter would rather the mentioned event or situation not happen. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine the tweet's sentiment with 100% certainty.

There is a border - crossing point with Albania at the village of Sukobin near the Skadar Lake . - Tirana (regional Gheg Albanian: \\"Tirona\\") is the capital and largest city of Albania and as well the heart of Albania's cultural, economic and governmental activity. It is located on the western center of the country surrounded by hills with the Dajti Mountain on the east and a slight valley opening on the north-west overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. The city is located some north of Athens, west of Skopje, south-east of Pristina and south of Podgorica. - The Strait of Otranto connects the Adriatic Sea with the Ionian Sea and separates Italy from Albania. Its width at Punta Palascìa, east of Salento is less than . The strait is named after the Italian city of Otranto. - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea. - Macedonia ( tr. \\"Makedonija\\"), officially the Republic of Macedonia (Macedonian: , tr. \\"Republika Makedonija\\"), is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, from which it declared independence in 1991. It became a member of the United Nations in 1993, but, as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\", was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia), a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and NATO. - Albanians are an ethnic group native to Albania and neighboring countries. The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania. Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia, with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslim (mainly Sunni, with a smaller Shia, Sufi and Bektashi component), and a minority are nominally Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Ulcinj (Montenegrin Cyrillic: , ; Albanian: \\"Ulqini\\") is a town and former bishopric on the southern coast of Montenegro and the capital of Ulcinj Municipality.

Question: Who stabs Harold? Movie title: Hospital Massacre Movie plot: In 1961, an unpopular boy named Harold leaves a Valentine's Day card at the home of Susan Jeremy. Susan and her friend David mock and crumple up the card, prompting an enraged Harold to break into the house, and kill David by hanging him from a hatstand. Nineteen years later, Susan is divorced, has a daughter, and a new boyfriend named Jack. On Valentine's Day, Susan has Jack take her to a hospital to pick up test results, and on the way into the building, she is observed from a window by a man in surgical garb. The man strokes a photograph of a young Susan, and sabotages the elevator Susan boards in order to delay her while he kills the doctor who has her paperwork, which the murderer tampers with. A janitor finds the doctor's body, and has his face dunked into a sink full of acid by the killer. While looking for the doctor, Susan coerces a friendly intern named Harry into getting her results, which Harry notices are abnormal, prompting him to bring them and Susan to Doctor Saxon. The peculiarities of Susan's paperwork (which the murderer further sabotages after killing a pair of laboratory workers) cause Doctors Saxon and Beam to order that she be detained for observation. Harry uncovers evidence suggesting that someone is pulling a \\"con job\\" on Susan, but he disappears after promising Susan he will straighten things out. Jack, who had fallen asleep in his car while waiting for Susan, enters the hospital to look for her, and is lured to an empty room, where he is decapitated. The killer places a box containing Jack's head in Susan's room, then replaces it with a cake (identical to one seen in the intro) when Susan goes in search of aid. After Susan tells him about Harry's findings, Saxon goes to look over the copies of her paperwork in the archives, where he is murdered with an axe, an act witnessed by Susan.

Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) are a neurotic couple who've experienced multiple failed attempts to conceive, and Shane (Faizon Love), who has recently separated from his wife, has a much younger twenty-year-old girlfriend, Trudy (Kali Hawk). At Dave's son's birthday party, Jason and Cynthia, using PowerPoint, announce their troubled marriage and they are considering divorce because they cannot have a baby. As a last-ditch effort, they have found a couples therapy resort named Eden. A deal called the Pelican Package is half the normal cost if they can get three other couples to join them. In their presentation, they show beautiful pictures of sunlit beaches and beautiful locations. They also assure the others that the couples therapy is purely optional. Dave and Ronnie discuss their inability to go because of childcare responsibilities and decline the trip.

Q: If I tell you that Whistles use air to make sound, and ask you the question \\"what do whistles use to make sound?\\", is the correct answer \\"collagen\\"? Select from: (a). Yes; (b). No; The answer is:","completion":"(b). No; Whistles do not use collagen to make sound. They operate on the principle of airflow and resonance to create sound. When air is blown into a whistle, it passes through a small opening (the window or mouthpiece) which speeds up the air. As the air exits the whistle, it is forced onto a beveled edge (the fipple or blade), causing the air to vibrate and produce sound. The pitch of the sound can be altered by changing the size, shape, and material of the whistle, as well as the force and angle of the airstream, but the material in this case is usually metal or plastic, not collagen. Collagen is a naturally occurring protein often found in the skin, hair, and nails of animals and humans - it does not produce sound when air is passed over it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps. Now, I have a new situation: Rob was in the East Coast for a month. He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. Answer this question please: In which case the low waters would be higher, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In case A, Rob observed the spring tide. Spring tides occur when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned, which results in higher high tides and lower low tides due to their combined gravitational pull. In case B, Rob observed the neap tide, which occurs when the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter and the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth. In this scenario, the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force, leading to less extreme tidal conditions. Comparing the low waters in both cases, case A (spring tide) would have lower low waters than case B (neap tide). Given the question is asking in which case the low waters would be higher, the answer would be case B, the neap tide. During neap tides, the low waters are higher and less extreme than during spring tides, as the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon is not combined and acting in the same direction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

After understanding the meaning of each word, I translated the sentence into Hebrew by finding the appropriate words in Hebrew that convey the same meaning: - \\"זה\\" is the Hebrew word for \\"it is\\" or \\"this is.\\" - \\"כל כך\\" is the Hebrew expression for \\"so\\" or \\"very.\\" - \\"מוזר\\" is the Hebrew word for \\"strange\\" or \\"weird.\\" Finally, I combined these Hebrew words in a way that retains the original meaning of the Spanish sentence: \\"זה כל כך מוזר\\" (literally, \\"it is so strange\\")."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will contest the disrepute charge for criticising referee Chris Foy after his team’s FA Cup draw at Cambridge two weeks ago. Van Gaal said it was ‘always the same’ with referees when bigger teams play against smaller clubs, leading the FA to charge him with implying bias on Foy’s part. Now it has emerged the United manager will request a personal hearing with the governing body at which he will explain he was just trying to make a general point. Louis van Gaal hopes he won't have have the book thrown at him for comments made about referee Chris Foy. United take on West Ham away on Sunday and Van Gaal said: ‘I am not angry, I am very disappointed. I am now for nearly 30 years a trainer-coach or manager and I have never been charged. And still, up to now, I don’t think that I said something wrong. ‘I said already in our press conference (before the game) the same phrases, because I know in advance everything is in favour of the underdog. ‘I said it before the game and I said it after the game, only in the meaning of the general feeling of everybody, everybody for the underdog. ‘So I cannot imagine the FA has charged me. But, OK, it’s like that. Of course I will contest it. I never said anything wrong. You can confirm, as the media, that I never say anything about the referee, in all the matches.’ Van Gaal's men were held to a 0-0 draw against League Two team Cambridge United back in January. However the Red Devils did not let lightning strike twice and were 3-0 winners in the replay at Old Trafford. Van Gaal refused to buy in to former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson’s theory that the FA used to pick on the club simply because of its standing in the game. But it is clear he is irritated. United are, at least, in the next round of the FA Cup, having beaten Cambridge 3-0 in the replay at Old Trafford on Tuesday. That game featured an impressive cameo appearance from Spaniard Ander Herrera who has hardly played this season despite being bought for £29million in the summer. Van Gaal said: ‘He’s a great guy, he’s a great professional also, so that’s not the problem. His problem is he has to compete with high-level players. Wayne Rooney is the captain so he has a privilege (of always playing) — I have explained that — so then the other places... in this system, for example, that we are playing now, the No 10... that’s Juan Mata, that’s Angel di Maria. ‘That’s difficult to compete with, but he did already know that at the moment he signed. When you sign for a top club, he knows that he has to fight. But he is fighting.’ Former manager Sir Alex Ferguson (left) was believed United were treated harshly because of their profile. Ander Herrera (centre) has impressed i cameo appearances but faces stiff competition for a starting place. Di Maria, meanwhile, has continued to make himself available for selection despite the fact he and his family are living in a hotel following an attempted burglary at their home last weekend. ‘He is worried about his wife and child, but I have spoken with him and he wanted to play against Cambridge United and I played him,’ explained Van Gaal, who laid a wreath at Old Trafford yesterday as an act of remembrance for those who died in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6, 1958. ‘I have decided in the past that I will never play a player in those circumstances, because of the total human-being principle. But with him, I had the feeling that I had to give him a chance to play. He played well. And of course, I have to decide again when we face West Ham.’ Angel di Maria is available against West Ham despite a stressful attempted burglary o his home.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Question: \\"What happened under the rule of Emporer Chu Ti in 1409?\\" Answer: \\"Imported Islam to Melaka and Sumatra\\" Is this answer correct? Select from: (A). no. (B). yes....I think the answer is","completion":"(A). no.

They offered port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. However, Emperor Chu Ti and this event were not responsible for importing Islam to Melaka and Sumatra. It was later, during the rule of Sri Maharajah, that Islam spread to the region through marriage, trade, and peaceful preaching."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Rajasinghe II, the king of Kandy, made a treaty with the Dutch in 1638 to get rid of the Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas of the island. The main conditions of the treaty were that the Dutch were to hand over the coastal areas they had captured to the Kandyan king in return for a Dutch trade monopoly over the island. The agreement was breached by both parties. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 and the last Portuguese strongholds near Jaffnapatnam in 1658. By 1660 they controlled the whole island except the land-locked kingdom of Kandy. The Dutch persecuted the Catholics and the remaining Portuguese settlers but left Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims alone. The Dutch levied far heavier taxes on the people than the Portuguese had done.

The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics....

Pelosi claimed that momentum was with the Democrats and that they had the message, messengers, money, and mobilization to take back the House. Ryan's budget proposal aimed to convert part of the Medicare program into a government subsidy to help senior citizens purchase private insurance. While Republicans asserted that seniors would have the option to remain in the traditional government-run Medicare program, Democrats saw the GOP plan as a transition that would shift future cost increases in medical care onto seniors. Romney did not fully adopt Ryan's plan. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, commented that attacks on U.S. posts abroad may still continue, and there is no way to predict the trajectory of these events. Rice attributed the attacks, including the one in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others, to an anti-Muslim movie trailer rather than an expression of hostilities towards the United States or its policies. Sen. John McCain defended Romney's criticism of a Cairo embassy statement that appeared apologetic for the anti-Islamic film trailer which allegedly ignited the attacks on U.S. posts abroad. McCain stated that the media's coverage of the issue was saddening and emphasized the importance of freedom of speech. Sen. McCain also said that there was no doubt that the attacks on U.S. posts abroad were the acts of extremists, attributing the violence to a change in America's foreign policy of \\"disengagement.\\" He argued that terrorists exploited the anti-Islamic film trailer to fuel the attacks, but they were preplanned. McCain claimed that the struggle in the Arab world was between Islamists and the forces of moderation, with Islamists pushing the offensive video to incite the forces that would bring about their rise to power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to this question would be an entity as it refers to the identification of specific living beings. The two largest birds on Earth are the ostrich (Struthio camelus) and the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius). The ostrich is considered the largest bird in terms of both height and weight. Native to Africa, ostriches can grow up to 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall and weigh up to 320 pounds (145 kilograms). Ostriches are flightless, but their powerful legs enable them to run at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour). Their legs are also armed with sharp claws, which they use as a means of defense against predators. Ostriches have small wings relative to their body size, which are used for balance when running and as a signaling mechanism when warding off threats or attracting mates. Their diet consists of plant material, seeds, and insects. The southern cassowary, another flightless bird, is native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, northeastern Australia, and nearby islands. They are considered the second-largest bird on Earth, standing up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) tall and weighing up to 190 pounds (86 kilograms). Southern cassowaries are characterized by their distinctive, horn-like casque on top of their heads, which is made of a sponge-like material covered by keratin – the same material found in human hair and nails. The cassowary's casque is believed to help amplify or muffle sounds through the dense rainforest environment, aid in communication, and provide some protection. Southern cassowaries have powerful legs, armed with 5-inch-long (12.7 centimeter-long) dagger-like claws on their inner toes, which are used in self-defense. These birds are also known to be solitary and can be quite aggressive when protecting their territory or their young. Their diet consists mainly of fallen fruits and a variety of plants, but they may occasionally consume insects, small mammals, and birds. Therefore, the answer to the question regarding the two largest birds on Earth consists of two entities: the ostrich and the southern cassowary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Art Schlichter is a former professional football player, who played as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) and the Arena Football League (AFL). He was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in 1982 as the fourth overall pick in the NFL Draft. Schlichter's NFL career was marred by gambling issues and legal troubles that led to him spending time in jail and receiving multiple suspensions from the league. Schlichter played for the following teams during his football career: In the NFL: 1. Baltimore Colts (1982-1983): He began his professional career here, but poor performances, injuries, and suspensions limited his playing time. 2. Indianapolis Colts (1984): After the team relocated to Indianapolis, Schlichter continued to struggle with his gambling problems, eventually receiving a suspension for the remainder of the 1983 season and all of 1984. In the Arena Football League: 1. Detroit Drive (1990): Art Schlichter joined the Detroit Drive in 1990 and played a significant role in leading the team to the ArenaBowl IV title. His time in the AFL proved more successful than his NFL career, and Schlichter finally seemed to find his place as a professional football player. 2. Cincinnati Rockers (1992): After a brief retirement, Schlichter returned to the AFL with the Cincinnati Rockers. He had some success on the field but was released by the team due to off-field issues. Ultimately, to answer the question \\"What team did Art Schlichter play for?\\" accurately, mention that Schlichter played for the Baltimore Colts, Indianapolis Colts, Detroit Drive, and Cincinnati Rockers, with his most successful stint being with the Detroit Drive in the AFL."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who depicted dignified aspects of war? ? In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who depicted the dignified aspects of war, as mentioned in the article, is Roger Fenton.

Answer the question...when was the first subway built in new york city??","completion":"The first subway in New York City, which is now part of the largest and most complex public transportation network in the United States, dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The construction of the initial underground railway system in NYC was motivated by the need to alleviate traffic congestion on streets and improve public transportation throughout the rapidly growing metropolis. The inception of the project can be traced back to entrepreneur Alfred Ely Beach, who, in 1869, secretly began the construction of a short experimental pneumatic subway line called the Beach Pneumatic Transit. With a length of just 95 meters (312 feet), it was a small-scale prototype that served to demonstrate the potential of an underground transit system to the world. While it was never expanded beyond this initial tunnel, it can be considered a starting point for the development of New York City's subway. The actual construction of the first subway line in New York City commenced on March 24, 1900. This historic project was undertaken by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), a private company awarded the contract to build and operate the line. The construction was a challenging endeavor that faced several engineering obstacles, such as working around existing infrastructure and dealing with varying ground conditions. Designed by architect and engineer William Barclay Parsons, the first subway line was known as the \\"Contract One\\" subway. It comprised 15.6 kilometers (9.7 miles) of track and 28 stations, running from City Hall in Lower Manhattan to West 145th Street in Harlem. The initial segment, extending from the City Hall station to 145th Street and Broadway, was opened to the public on October 27, 1904—this marked the official birth of New York City's subway system. The subway system expanded rapidly in the subsequent years, and additional lines were built to serve the growing population and the city's sprawling landscape. In 1908, the IRT further extended the subway into the Bronx, and in 1910, the Dual Contracts were signed, paving the way for new lines and modernizing others. Today, the New York City Subway is an extensive and complex network comprising 472 stations and covering 399 kilometers (248 miles) of routes. Operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), it has played an essential role in shaping and connecting the city as we know it today. The development of the subway contributed to both the economic growth of New York City and improvements in the overall quality of life for its residents by providing affordable, efficient, and safe transportation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sending loving messages linked to relationship satisfaction. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: How Texting Habits Impact Relationship Quality: A Closer Look at Gender Differences Introduction: In recent years, the role of technology in maintaining and nurturing romantic relationships has become increasingly significant. From online dating apps to social media, couples rely heavily on technology to communicate and stay connected. Text messaging, in particular, has become the primary mode of communication among couples. But does the frequency and content of texts truly influence the quality of relationships? According to researcher Lori Schade, there are gender-specific differences in the way texting impacts relationship quality. Step 1: Explain the research findings by Lori Schade Lori Schade's research highlights the notion that men and women experience varying degrees of relationship quality based on their texting habits. Schade emphasizes that \\"you don't get to see the breadth of a person you need to see\\" through text messages, addressing the limitations of this form of communication. Step 2: Elaborate on the impact of texting habits on men's relationship quality According to Schade's findings, men who send the majority of texts in a relationship may experience lower relationship quality. In addition, men may also feel unhappy when dealing with frequent text messages. The reason behind this could be that men may prefer direct communication and the non-verbal cues that come with face-to-face conversations. Step 3: Discuss the effects of texting on women's relationship quality Schade's research also reveals that women may suffer from lower relationship quality when they use texting to resolve relationship problems. This is likely because problem-solving discussions require a clearer understanding of emotions, which can be challenging to convey through text. Step 4: Address how sending loving messages impact relationship satisfaction On a positive note, both men and women reportedly experience greater relationship satisfaction when they send and receive loving messages through text. This finding emphasizes the importance of affectionate communication in maintaining and strengthening romantic bonds. Step 5: Provide suggestions to improve relationship quality through texting habits Given this research, couples should be mindful of their texting habits and take into account the possible impact on their relationship quality. A few suggestions to consider are: 1. Use texting primarily for casual conversations and expressions of affection, and avoid engaging in serious or sensitive discussions through text. 2. Be mindful of the frequency of texts, to avoid overwhelming or irritating your partner. 3. Make an effort to have meaningful face-to-face conversations, where both verbal and non-verbal cues can be fully understood and appreciated. Conclusion: In conclusion, Lori Schade's research offers valuable insights into the complex world of texting and how it can influence relationship quality. By understanding the gender differences associated with texting habits, couples can be more aware of how their communication styles may impact their overall satisfaction. By incorporating these findings and adopting healthier texting habits, couples can work towards enhancing their relationship quality and forging stronger connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer indicates that the place is good for a night out with girls. This suggests that the atmosphere is upbeat, comfortable, and perhaps even stylish or sophisticated. The reference to it becoming a club on a Saturday night means that it likely has lively music, ambiance, and can accommodate larger groups. 2. There is a mention of the fact that there is no cover charge on a Saturday night, which again indicates a positive sentiment since this can be a cost-saving feature. 3. The reviewer does appreciate the ginger cocktail, signifying satisfaction with some aspect of the beverage options. It appears as though there may be a range in selections and are capable of pleasing varying tastes. 4. The Yellowtail roll and Geisha roll are also appreciated, which points towards approval towards at least some of the food offerings. 5. Furthermore, the use of words such as 'good' and 'like' communicate positive emotions towards the establishment. Negative Sentiments: 1. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the lychee martini, which implies that not all the beverages are to their taste. This could reflect a lacking in some aspects of their drink menu or in the mixology skills. 2. The review contains a desire for a cheaper dinner option, specifically referring to bento. This implies that the reviewer found the menu a bit pricy, or not offering enough value for money, an aspect which they would have preferred to be different. Summing up, the review has both positive and negative sentiments, but they lean more towards the positive side. The reviewer enjoyed the experience on the whole, and while there are areas for improvement (drink quality and price), these problems did not completely overshadow the pleasant aspects of the experience. This would be considered a fairly balanced review with a slight inclination towards positivity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Habitat: The Western Capercaillie inhabits mainly mixed and coniferous forests, with preferences ranging from boreal to mountainous regions. Their ideal habitat consists of a mosaic of old, dense forest patches for cover and food resources, scattered with younger tree stands and openings for mating displays. They can be found across Eurasia, spanning countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Scotland, Russia, and Central Europe. Behavior: Western Capercaillies are renowned for their elaborate mating rituals, called \\"lekking.\\" In early spring, males gather at traditional lek sites (clearings in the forest) to perform their courtship displays, which involve erecting their fanned tail feathers, raising the red combs over their eyes, and making a series of deep, guttural sounds, followed by wing flapping. This stunning display attracts females to the lek who then choose a male to mate with based on their performance. Diet: The diet of the Western Capercaillie varies seasonally. During spring and summer, they primarily consume a wide variety of leaves, shoots, flowers, and seeds from trees such as pine, spruce, and bilberry. As winter sets in, their diet shifts to focus on conifer needles and buds, often from Scotland's native Caledonian pine. Although largely herbivorous, they occasionally feed on insects and small invertebrates, especially during their breeding season when these protein sources are crucial for growing chicks. Conservation: The Western Capercaillie is listed as \\"Least Concern\\" on the IUCN Red List. However, in some parts of its range, the species is considered threatened or endangered due to a combination of factors including habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation caused by logging, agricultural conversion, and infrastructure development. Climate change and increased disturbance by humans (e.g., outdoor recreation) also pose threats to the species. Conservation efforts are focused on habitat preservation, restoration, and promoting responsible land management practices to safeguard this iconic species' future. In summary, the Tetraourogallus, or Western Capercaillie, is a large, distinctive grouse species inhabiting the coniferous forests of Eurasia. They possess unique physical characteristics, intriguing lekking behavior, and a seasonal diet, making them an interesting and noteworthy component of the ecosystems they inhabit. Despite facing threats to their survival, ongoing conservation efforts aim to protect and preserve their distinctive habitats and natural history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project.

Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes instantly smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects \\"bad boy\\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.At the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk.

They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night.

Review: Wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews I've read. Turns out, I could have never imagined this movie, because it's very close to \\"The Bride with White Hair\\" in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic.

There's nothing scary about it, that's not the theme, it's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with wild outlandish Kung Fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less).

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"If a weak filter is used, it is likely to have larger pores or less effective filtering material than a more robust filter. This can significantly affect the filter's ability to catch more chemicals and remove contaminants from the water. A weaker filter may result in the following: 1. Less effective removal of pollutants: A weak filter may have a reduced ability to remove contaminants effectively. This means that more impurities, such as chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals, will remain in the water after filtration. The filtered water might not be as clean and safe for consumption as it should be. 2. Increased passage of mineral ions: A weak filter may also allow more mineral ions, like fluoride, to pass through the filtration system. This could lead to an imbalance in the mineral content of the filtered water if too much or too little of these ions are allowed through. 3. Filter lifespan and efficiency: A weak filter may not be as durable or long-lasting as a stronger one, meaning it may need to be replaced more often. Additionally, its efficiency in removing contaminants might decline more rapidly over time, further reducing the overall effectiveness of the filtration system. 4. Potential build-up of contaminants: If a weak filter does not effectively catch pollutants, there may be a build-up of these contaminants within the filtration system itself. This can result in poor water quality and negatively impact the performance or lifespan of other components in the system. In conclusion, using a weak filter can result in less effective removal of contaminants from the water, leading to poorer water quality and potential risks for consumers.

Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors.

As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies.

The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process.

Answer the following question: If cucumber flowers are pollinated by insects to create cucumbers, then how do cucumbers come from flowers? Answer choices: - The flowers are pollinated - fertilization occurs - fertilization - Help plants grow - The flowers fall off - They get too much water - it keeps an organism warm - They grow underground Answer:","completion":"The process of cucumber formation from flowers involves a series of steps. Firstly, the flowers are pollinated by insects like bees who transfer pollen from the male flowers to the female flowers. This process is essential for fertilization to occur, as it helps in the fusion of male and female gametes. After successful pollination and fertilization, the flower's ovary begins to enlarge and develop into a fruit, which in this case is the cucumber. The fertilization process ensures that a viable seed can be formed inside the fruit, enabling reproduction and the future growth of new cucumber plants. During the cucumber's growth stage, the petals of the flower fall off, as their purpose of attracting pollinators has been fulfilled. The developing cucumber grows in size and continues to mature, drawing water and nutrients from the plant. Contrary to the notion of underground growth, cucumbers grow above the ground on vines or trellises, depending on how they are supported during cultivation. In summary, cucumbers come from flowers through the process of pollination, followed by fertilization, resulting in the growth and development of the cucumber from the fertilized ovary while the flower petals fall off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - fast food restaurant - vegetable market - ireland - produce market - dessert spot A:","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"What business uses lots of potatoes?\\" is a fast food restaurant. First and foremost, fast food restaurants, which are part of a global multi-billion dollar industry, rely heavily on potatoes as a staple ingredient in their menus. The popularity of fast food chains can be attributed to their quick service, affordability, and appealing taste that caters to a wide range of consumers. In these establishments, potatoes are usually served in the form of French fries, a universally adored side dish or snack that complements various types of fast food items like burgers, sandwiches, and fried chicken. The reason why potatoes, specifically in the form of French fries, are so widespread in fast food establishments is due to their flavor, texture, and adaptability. The process of deep-frying potatoes creates a crispy exterior with a soft and fluffy interior, making them an irresistible combination that many customers crave. Additionally, French fries can be served with a variety of toppings and condiments, such as cheese, chili, ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar, providing an array of options for customers to choose from or customize according to their preferences. Besides being a side dish, potatoes are also used as ingredients in other fast food offerings, such as hash browns served during breakfast hours, potato wedges, and even as a component in some specialty sandwiches. Therefore, the potato's versatility and compatibility with other food items make it a staple in the fast food restaurant business. While other options like vegetable markets, produce markets, and Ireland encompass businesses or places where potatoes are involved in some capacity, these options don't specifically revolve around using large quantities of potatoes in their day-to-day operations. Vegetable markets and produce markets are places where potatoes are sold in their raw and unprocessed form, and their main function is to act as a platform for customers to purchase fresh produce, not necessarily making use of the potatoes themselves. As for Ireland, it is true that potatoes have historically been an important part of the country's agricultural economy. However, Ireland refers to a geographic location and not a specific type of business that consumes large amounts of potatoes. Lastly, a dessert spot is a business that focuses primarily on providing an array of sweet treats and delicacies. Although some desserts may occasionally use potatoes as an ingredient, it's not the main focus of their offerings, so the use of potatoes in dessert spots is far less significant than in a fast food restaurant. In conclusion, a fast food restaurant is the most suitable option to answer the question since these establishments consistently use vast quantities of potatoes to cater to the culinary needs and tastes of their customers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Statement Analysis: - Anthropologists and archaeologists in the 1980s suggested that most contemporary groups identified as hunter-gatherers do not have a continuous history of hunting and gathering. - The statement claims that many of these groups have ancestors who were agriculturalists and/or pastoralists who were pushed into marginal areas due to various reasons, including migrations, economic exploitation, and violent conflict. Now, I will investigate if the information in the statement serves as the correct answer to the question. Question: If they're not purely hunter-gatherers, then what do they have a history of being? The statement suggests that many groups usually identified as hunter-gatherers have a history of being agriculturalists and/or pastoralists. This directly addresses the question of what these groups' history might be if they are not purely hunter-gatherers. Therefore, based on the statement provided, the correct answer to the question would be that, if they're not purely hunter-gatherers, they have a history of being agriculturalists and/or pastoralists.

If \\"Three young men are playing monopoly together, and one is being pushed by the other.\\", can we conclude \\"three men are playing\\"?","completion":"Based on the initial statement, it can be concluded that three young men are playing Monopoly together, which is a board game where players engage in various activities like buying, selling, and trading properties. The statement also mentions that one of the players is being pushed by another. It's important to recognize that the act of being pushed in the context of playing Monopoly should be interpreted figuratively, and not literally. In this scenario, being \\"pushed\\" by another player might indicate that the player in question is under some kind of pressure, or being challenged or provoked by another player's actions on the board. For example, they may feel cornered by the other player's property acquisitions or threatened by their overall game strategy. This might also imply some level of competitiveness or rivalry among the participants. Despite the presence of the pushing element, the focus remains on the fact that all three young men are engaged in playing Monopoly together. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that three men are playing Monopoly in this scenario. The fact that one is being pushed by the other simply provides additional context and introduces an aspect of interactivity, competition, or contention among the players. It does not negate or modify the fact that there are three men actively involved in the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: The battle lines are drawn once again. U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Professor Kristan's mother was bitten by a vampire bat in a cave in Africa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal. Question: How did the scientists put Keta into clinical death? Yes or no, is the answer \\"By putting her to sleep, lowering her temperature and draining her blood.\\"?

DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that genes are really messages. They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first \\"word\\" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. So far, scientists have found all the words in the DNA map, but we still don't understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\" means, we can help to save people from several illnesses. So the more we understand, the more doctors will be able to do.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot.

Stossel was born on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago's affluent North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as \\"the superstar of the family\\", commenting, \\"While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School.\\" Stossel has written three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 autobiography from Harper Perennial documenting his career and philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel - Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, which was published in 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails - But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does. With financial support from the libertarian Palmer R. Chitester Fund, Stossel and ABC News launched a series of educational materials for public schools in 1999 entitled \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\". It was taken over in 2006 by the Center for Independent Thought and releases a new DVD of teaching materials annually. In 2006, Stossel and ABC released Teaching Tools for Economics, a video series based on the National Council of Economics Education standards. Since February 2011, Stossel has written a weekly newspaper column for Creators Syndicate. His articles appear in such online publications as Newsmax, Reason, and Townhall. what types of government policies?","completion":"In his third book, \\"No, They Can't: Why Government Fails - But Individuals Succeed,\\" John F. Stossel argues that various government policies meant to solve problems often end up producing new ones. While the quote from the article does not specify every type of government policy Stossel addresses in his book, it's clear that he has a general skepticism about the efficiency and effectiveness of government intervention. Given Stossel's libertarian leaning, it's likely that the types of government policies he critiques may include those related to economic regulations, social services, and government spending. Examples could be policies governing minimum wage, business regulations, taxation, healthcare, and welfare programs. Stossel emphasizes his belief in the efficiency of free individuals and the private sector performing tasks that are often assigned to the government. Drawing from his philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism, as described in his 2005 autobiography, \\"Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media,\\" Stossel is also known for his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Spring-flowering bulbs are most visually appealing when a variety of flowers are planted in an arrangement. Depending on your level of gardening experience, you may want to start out with only 2 or 3 types of spring bulbs. If you’re confident in your gardening skills, select a half dozen bulb varieties. Purchase at least 3 or 4 individual bulbs of each variety. Popular combinations of spring bulbs that can be planted together include: Tulips, daffodils, and snowflakes. Bearded irises, Siberian irises, crocuses, and bluebells. Snowdrops, crocuses, and hyacinth. Note that the bulbs in each combination are roughly the same size and can be planted at the same depth in the same hole. Nearly all plant nurseries stock bulbs year-round. If you visit the nursery in the fall, around September or October in the Northern Hemisphere, their selection of spring-blooming bulbs will be at its largest. Healthy, high quality bulbs will be rounded and firm, and not have any cracks or wrinkles on their surface. If there isn’t a nursery in your area, many large home-supply stores have an onsite gardening center. If you don’t live near a brick and mortar nursery or garden center—or if you prefer to shop online—you can find a wide variety of bulbs through seed catalogs. Search by flower name until you find the type of bulbs you’re looking for. If the bulbs are organized by growing season, search for “spring-blooming bulbs.” For example, look through the online bulb selection at Gurney’s, Park Seed, or FedCo Seeds.

From the moment I entered, the atmosphere was underwhelming, and it gradually went downhill from there. My review details the numerous aspects where I believe the establishment fell short and could use significant improvement. To begin with, the venue's interior design left a lot to be desired. The lighting was dull, making the space feel gloomy and unwelcoming. The furnishings were dated and worn out, detracting from the overall ambiance of the venue. To add to this, the layout of the seating arrangement was disorganized and uncomfortable, with tables situated too closely together, making for an intrusive dining environment. Moving on to the service, it was far from what one would expect from a reputed place. The staff members appeared disinterested and poorly trained. Upon being greeted at the entrance, the host took an unusually long time to find a suitable table for us, making us feel unwelcomed. When we finally did get seated, our server was inattentive and unfamiliar with the menu, which made it challenging for us to make informed choices based on their recommendations. As for the food, it was certainly the most disappointing aspect of the experience. The menu options seemed limited, lacking in terms of creativity and variety. When the dishes finally arrived after a long wait, they were underwhelming in presentation and portion sizes. The taste was bland, and the quality of the ingredients left a lot to be desired. The dishes lacked the balance and complexity of flavors one would expect at a high-quality establishment. This was particularly evident in the main course, where the meat was overcooked and excessively dry, while the vegetables were undercooked and lackluster in flavor. Additionally, the overall hygiene and cleanliness within the establishment were not up to par. The restroom facilities were in poor condition, with unpleasant odors and insufficiently stocked essentials. Even the table linens and cutlery showed signs of wear and previous usage, with faint stains and scratches that detracted from the dining experience. Lastly, considering the numerous issues outlined above, I found the prices to be unjustifiably steep. It was difficult to justify paying such a premium for an experience that failed to meet basic expectations in terms of food, service, and ambiance. In conclusion, my visit to this place was a letdown, marred by poor ambiance, inattentive service, subpar food quality, and high prices that did not align with the overall experience. I cannot recommend this establishment in its current state, and I sincerely hope the management takes notice of these concerns and addresses them to improve the venue for future patrons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Alan took an early interest in gardening---first on his grandfather's Yorkshire allotment in Ilkley, and then in his parents' back garden. Small polythene greenhouses appeared in the back garden, and cacti were bought from church markets. Alan left school at fifteen with one \`O' level in Art and took a job as an apprentice gardener in Ilkley Parks Department nursery, studying for his City and Guilds in Horticulture in the evening. He went on to horticultural college at Oaklands in Hertfordshire where he studied for one year full-time, being awarded the National Certificate in Horticultural. This was followed by three years at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, resulting in the award of the Kew Diploma. After two years as supervisor of staff training at Kew, Alan entered journalism where he became first a gardening books editor, and then Deputy Editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. He appeared regularly on BBC Radio and Television in programs such as Nationwide , Breakfast Time, Open Air, Pebble Mill, Songs of Praise, Titchmarsh's Travels, and the Chelsea Flower Show. He presented the 100th edition of The Word for Channel 4, and hosted the quiz show Ask the Family. Gardeners' World and the hugely popular Ground Force, second only to Easterners in the BBC1 ratings, are broadcast as far as Australia, New Zealand and North America. After leaving both programs, Alan worked on two other series for the BBC to be transmitted in 2003 and 2004, one of them a landmark series on the natural history of Britain.

Context: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all.

Question: Information: - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Halberstadt is a town in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, the capital of Harz district. Located north of the Harz mountain range, it is known for its old town centre that was severely damaged in World War II and rebuilt in the following decades. - Israel Jacobson ( October 17 , 1768 , Halberstadt -- September 14 , 1828 , Berlin ) was a German - Jewish philanthropist and communal organiser . While he lacked a systematic religious approach , he is considered one of the heralds of Reform Judaism . - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\".

It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination which emphasizes the evolving nature of the religion, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. It is characterized by a lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as of basically non-binding nature, and great openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates. Its greatest center today is in North America. - Abraham Geiger (24 May 181023 October 1874) was a German rabbi and scholar, considered the founding father of Reform Judaism. Emphasizing its constant development along history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to reformulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Harz is the highest mountain range in Northern Germany and its rugged terrain extends across parts of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. The name \\"Harz\\" derives from the Middle High German word \\"Hardt\\" or \\"Hart\\" (mountain forest), Latinized as \\"Hercynia\\". The legendary Brocken is the highest summit in the Harz with a height of above sea level.

Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic.

Run by the Department of Homeland Security, the ESTA program is designed to give U.S. authorities extra time and resources to check a traveler's name against \\"no fly\\" lists and other terrorist databases. Until now, that registration process was free. To participate in the program, travelers must also have Internet access and a credit card, The New York Times reported. Travelers are urged to register at the denied, the traveler must apply for a more expensive nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. The reason for the denial will not be provided.

Starting on Sept. 8, that registration process will require a 14 fee, paid by credit or debit card. ESTA approval, which went into effect in early 2009, allows travelers to enter the United States without a full travel visa, which can cost over 100. The ESTA authorization lasts for two years (or until the individual’s passport expires), and is valid for multiple entries. This creates another potential roadblock for visitors from ESTA-participating countries, who will now need both Internet access and a MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover card (or a debit card within those networks). (The C.B.P. says it is looking into expanding to other forms of payment.) The bulk of the 14 fee will fund tourism promotion, with the remainder going toward operation of the ESTA program. Of course, visitors from those participating countries — mostly European and far East Asian — will still need a valid passport for entry. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Starting from September 8, travelers flying to the United States from certain countries are required to pay a 14 \\"operational and travel promotion\\" fee if they do not possess a U.S. visa.

Question: when was fdr elected as president? Would \\"Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85, except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which still exists.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the information provided in the statement \\"Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85, except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which still exists.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question about when Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was elected as president. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, was first elected as president on November 8, 1932. He served four terms in office from March 4, 1933, until his death on April 12, 1945. His presidency was marked by significant events and policies, including the implementation of the New Deal to combat the Great Depression as well as leading the United States during most of World War II. The statement provided seems to pertain to the general deregulation movement in the United States that took place in the 1970s and 1980s. It is essential to note that the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) occurred during Roosevelt's tenure as president as a part of the New Deal measures. The SEC was established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which aimed to regulate the securities industry and prevent fraudulent practices following the 1929 stock market crash. So, to provide an appropriate and detailed answer to the question: Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as the president of the United States on November 8, 1932. During his tenure as president, FDR implemented numerous policies and reforms, including the aforementioned New Deal that introduced the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934. The SEC continues to exist and serves as a regulatory agency for Wall Street and securities markets. However, the information regarding deregulation in the 1970s and 1980s is not directly related to FDR's election or presidency and is more relevant to economic policy changes several decades after his time in office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Edith Hill, 96, and Eddie Harrison, 95, are thrilled to have found each other. \\"He touched my heart. I fell in love with him,\\" Hill told WJLA in July. The Virginia pair met 10 years ago while buying lottery tickets—splitting a 2,500 winner—and married earlier this year. But that union—an interracial one in a state that banned such marriages for decades—has instigated a court battle over Hill's estate and could end with the couple splitting up, the AP reports. Hill is legally incapacitated, and a judge has ruled daughter Rebecca Wright shouldn't have facilitated the marriage without the court's permission. Wright's sister, Patricia Barber, claims the union complicates the division of Hill's 475,000 estate, because now Harrison could inherit a portion. \\"She wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money,\\" Wright tells WUSA9. Should Barber win, Hill would have to move in with her or be put in a nursing home—either way, she and Harrison would be separated. \\"They're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them,\\" Harrison tells the station. The judge agrees on that score: Breaking them up could \\"create a circumstance in Ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve,\\" he ruled. To protect Hill's interests, an attorney has been appointed and her daughters removed as guardians. Wright believes ageism and racism are also at play in her sister's court action, telling WJLA that mindsets haven't changed.

Article:","completion":"Title: Edith Hill and Eddie Harrison: Unbreakable Love That Transcends Age and Race At the age of 96 and 95 respectively, Edith Hill and Eddie Harrison might not seem like the most typical candidates for newfound love and marriage. However, the Virginia couple, who met 10 years ago while buying lottery tickets and married earlier this year, have proven that the heart knows no boundaries. Yet, their love story is also tainted by an ongoing court battle that could threaten their life together. A fateful encounter over lottery tickets started it all. Hill told WJLA in July, \\"He touched my heart. I fell in love with him.\\" Their friendship grew over the years, and these two lovebirds decided to tie the knot. Noteworthy here is that their union is an interracial one, in a state that banned such marriages for decades. The couple, however, remains unshaken by this fact. “We see hearts, we don't see color,” they say. While Hill and Harrison are thrilled to have found each other, their marriage has instigated a court battle over Hill's estate, which could end up separating the couple. The issue revolves around Hill being legally incapacitated. A judge ruled that her daughter, Rebecca Wright, should not have facilitated the marriage without the court's permission in light of her mother's condition. Wright's sister, Patricia Barber, claims the union complicates the division of Hill's 475,000 estate because now, Harrison could inherit a portion. Barber's intentions have been a point of debate, with Wright telling WUSA9, \\"She wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money.\\" The stakes are high for the couple: if Barber wins the case, Hill may either have to move in with Barber or be placed in a nursing home, leading to her separation from Harrison. Despite this, the defiant couple declared, \\"They're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them.\\" Fortunately, the judge appears to agree with Hill and Harrison, ruling that separating them could \\"create a circumstance in Ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve.\\" To safeguard Hill's interests, an attorney has been appointed, and her daughters have been removed as guardians. Wright believes that ageism and racism also play a role in her sister's court action, telling WJLA that mindsets haven't changed despite Virginia lifting its ban on interracial marriages. However, Hill and Harrison remain focused on the love they share, which transcends the barriers of age and race. This remarkable story is a testament to how love can flourish despite external factors, such as age and societal prejudices. As this court battle unfolds, supporters of Hill and Harrison hope that their love and commitment to one another will prevail, allowing them to continue living their lives together, unencumbered by the ghosts of old biases and legal disputes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection. The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.
