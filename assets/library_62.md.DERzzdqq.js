A one-year-old whose face is paralyzed due to an extremely rare neurological condition is set to. undergo groundbreaking surgery that will see him smile for the first. time. Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, is one of several thousand people worldwide who suffers from Moebius Syndrome, which means he cannot blink, look side-to-side or move his mouth. However, doctors told KCCI.com that they are planning to treat his debilitating symptoms through a special procedure that will insert nerve and muscle tissue from his inner thigh into the jaw area. Expressionless: Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, whose face is paralyzed due to an extremely rare neurological condition, is set to undergo groundbreaking surgery that will see him smile for the first time. Preston's parents are now desperately trying to raise the 100,000 needed for the operation, often referred to as smile or reanimation surgery, which will take place when he turns five. Sarah Tassi said she and her husband, Jason first realized something was wrong shortly after Preston's birth on May 18, 2012. While ultrasounds had not detected anything unusual, they were surprised to see that he only had one finger on his right hand. Nurses were also concerned that he was breathing oddly and his eyes stayed wide open while he cried. Hoping to see their son smile: Sarah and Jason Tassi are desperately trying to raise the 100,000 needed for surgery to correct Preston's debilitating symptoms. After doctors assessed the newborn's condition, Mr and Mrs Tassi were called in to meet with a neurologist. An MRI scan confirmed that Preston had Moebius Syndrome. The incurable birth disorder prevents the cranial nerves around the brain from developing, resulting in an inability to move the eyes and face. In some cases it also impacts hearing. 'Just because someone may not smile on the outside, doesn't always mean they're not smiling on the inside' Other indicators include clubbed feet, missing digits and breathing difficulties. It is thought to affect roughly two to 20 births in every one million and a 2007 study identified 2,000 cases globally. Since birth Preston has been going to. weekly physical therapy sessions, but to restore control of his lips and. tongue surgical intervention will be needed. Mrs Tassi says that at the moment he is unable to eat unaided. 'As we feed him we have to hold his. cheeks in,' she explained. On the flip side Preston's motor skills are. on track with other children his age and he is almost ready to walk. In a bid to raise the thousands of dollars needed for surgery the Tassis have moved back in with their parents and set up a website called smilesforpreston.com. Step-by-step: Since birth Preston has been going for weekly physical therapy sessions. On their site they write: 'Preston is a remarkable little boy. Nothing is going to stand in his way. And we hope that sharing our story (his story), it will raise more awareness for others with this very rare syndrome. 'And for others to realize you can't always judge a book by it's cover. Just because someone may not smile on the outside... doesn't always mean they're not smiling on the inside.' Dr Nate Noble, Preston's doctor at Blank Children's Hospital, says his case will help professionals to better understand Moebius syndrome. Despite the challenges they have faced as new parents, Mr Tassi added: 'We just feel blessed to have him in our lives. Every second of it.' Moebius Syndrome, first described in 1888, is an extremely rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side-to-side. Most people with the condition have normal intelligence but they are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Other indicators include clubbed feet, missing digits and breathing difficulties. It is thought to affect two to 20 births in every one million. The disorder results from the underdevelopment of cranial nerves around the brain which control lateral eye movement and facial expression. Ocassionally hearing can also be affected. It is estimated that there are two to 20 cases of Moebius syndrome per million births. There is no single course of medical treatment or cure. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are recommended to improve motor skills and coordination. Smile or reanimation surgery, which transfers muscle and nerves grafted from the thigh to the corners of the mouth, can be performed to provide the ability to smile.

The question seeks information about the larger geographic context or group of islands that Guadalcanal, which is itself an island, belongs to. Guadalcanal is a part of the Solomon Islands, an archipelago consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands. The Solomon Islands are located in the South Pacific, to the northeast of Australia and east of Papua New Guinea. The archipelago is part of the geographic region known as Oceania, which also encompasses other Pacific Island countries such as Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The Solomon Islands cover a land area of approximately 28,000 square kilometers and possess a diverse range of ecosystems, from coral atolls and volcanic islands filled with lush vegetation to mountainous interiors and low-lying coastal plains. The islands are known for their rich biodiversity, including unique wildlife, dense rainforests, and pristine marine habitats. The Solomon Islands have a complex history, marked by centuries of diverse cultural and linguistic influences from Melanesian, Polynesian, and Asian peoples. Encounters with Europeans began in the 17th century, and the islands were later colonized by the British in the late 19th century. The Solomon Islands gained independence in 1978. During World War II, the Solomon Islands became a crucial battleground in the Pacific theatre, particularly between the United States and Japan. Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon Islands, was the site of the Guadalcanal Campaign in 1942-1943. The intense, months-long conflict between the Allied (primarily American) forces and the Japanese forces resulted in significant casualties on both sides and ultimately led to a strategic victory for the Allies. The Battle of Guadalcanal is considered one of the turning points of the Pacific War. In conclusion, the question \\"What island group is Guadalcanal a part of?\\" is asking about a location, specifically about the group of islands in which Guadalcanal is situated.

Part #3: There are no conversations where both senders are bots or both senders are humans Usage: N/A Explanation: This part clarifies that there will always be one bot and one human in each conversation, so since we classified SENDER A as 'Human,' we know that SENDER B must be a 'Bot.' Part #4: Only classify SENDER A, not SENDER B Usage: 'Human' Explanation: We already determined that SENDER A is a 'Human,' and we do not need to write anything about SENDER B. That means the output should only include the classification for SENDER A. Output: Human"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sweden's Klarna to Enter U.S. Online Payment Market STOCKHOLM—The already-crowded U.S. online-payments market is getting another player, with Sweden's Klarna AB saying it will join the fray early next year. The nine-year-old Swedish company has expanded at a fast clip from the Nordic countries to a number of large markets including the U.K. and Germany. Now, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski says the time is right to enter the U.S., with a launch planned there just after Christmas. Klarna is currently setting up offices in New York, Mr. Siemiatkowski said in an interview. The company expects to launch with five to 10 merchants signed up for the service. \\"Some are ones you definitely have heard of. Others will be more small, regional players. We will want a good variety to go to market with,\\" he said. \\"We've felt over the years that the opportunity is there, that our checkout product really has huge potential in the U.S.\\" He said Klarna, which has bagged close to 300 million in outside backing to date, can launch in the U.S. without having to raise any additional capital. But it may look at raise more money as it ramps up, Mr. Siemiatkowski said, anticipating a U.S. staff of more than a hundred in a couple of years, from around 20 expected at launch time. Klarna's management team includes fresh hires from both eBay Inc. EBAY -0.10 % 's PayPal unit and Apple Inc. AAPL 0.05 % The company would be facing huge rivals, including PayPal, which posted revenue of some 7 billion last year, compared with Klarna's 219.1 million in 2013. PayPal is currently the default payment option on millions of U.S. websites. And through its 800-million acquisition of Braintree Payments last year, PayPal also provides the payment back-end for many prominent startups, such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. Nevertheless, in less than 10 years, Klarna has grown into a substantial payment business. It expects revenue of 300 million this year. It has over a thousand employees set to handle over €7 billion (9.06 billion) of transactions this year in 15 markets. In a funding deal last year, it was valued at 1.4 billion. Sequoia Capital, whose previous investments includes early stakes in Apple and Google Inc., GOOGL 0.26 % is Klarna's largest outside backer. Mr. Siemiatkowski said Klarna's payment solution reduces to an absolute minimum the amount of information required from buyers to complete online purchases. \\"Basically, we are a user interface company with a very sophisticated risk engine,\\" Mr. Siemiatkowski said. Klarna earns most of its money through fees it charges merchants, but it also underwrites risk for online merchants and offers their buyers credit products such as installment plans. \\"We assume all the risk. We have the skin in the game,\\" said Brian Billingsley, the company's recently hired U.S. chief. In the U.S. Klarna will face a number of other upstarts trying to eke out market share in online and mobile payments, including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.05 % and Stripe Inc. Amazon last year rolled out an online checkout option for websites that mirrors PayPal's, though it has yet to attract many well-known websites. San Francisco-based Stripe recently reached agreement to provide online payments systems for both Apple and Twitter Inc. TWTR -3.82 % By one measure, Apple far outpaces PayPal or Amazon in online payments. With iTunes, Apple has at least 800 million active accounts, many of which have associated credit cards, compared with 250 million active accounts at Amazon and 150 million for PayPal. This month, Apple introduced Apple Pay, a wireless payments system for its new line of smartphones and smartwatches, that will let users buy merchandise simply by waving a newer iPhone or Apple Watch in front of a reader. —Greg Bensinger in San Francisco contributed to this article.

Given the question: Article: Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: \\"We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample.\\" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: \\"We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years.\\" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface.

Question: I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

Movie title: 5ive Girls Context: The story takes place at St. Mark's, a Catholic boarding school for girls. One day, a young student, Elizabeth, is studying in a classroom on the third floor, when without warning, she is attacked by unseen evil forces. One of St. Mark's priests, Father Drake, attempts to save Elizabeth from the apparently demonic aggressor, but he quickly proves to be powerless against it, and the girl vanishes without a trace.The school is immediately shut down, and all of the students are removed from campus by worried families. Five years later, the school reopens. A harsh headmistress, Miss Pearce, rules the girls with an iron fist; Father Drake remains at the school as a teacher, but because of the disappearance of Elizabeth he has become a drunkard, found by Miss Pearce at a bar. Five troubled and unwanted girls are left by their families at the school: Alex, Mara, Cecilia who is blind, Leah, and Connie. The girls are strictly forbidden to go to the third floor (the site of Elizabeth's disappearance). Cecilia and Mara enter the third floor, prompting Miss Pearce to punish the responsible party. Alex takes the blame and is severely beaten with a ruler.Alex begins to have visions of Elizabeth being possessed by a demon. Other strange things begin to happen, revealing that all five of the girls possess supernatural gifts. Connie is a \\"conduit,\\" or a magnet for spirit activity, Leah can pass through objects (though not doors or walls), Cecilia has \\"second site\\" or what the viewer could interpret as ESP, Mara can heal recent wounds (she heals Alex after her beating), and Alex has telekinesis. It is revealed that Miss Pearce has brought the girls to the school for a very specific reason and is seen conjuring them to a pentagram on the third floor, after which Connie appears to be possessed. A possessed Connie then attempts to drown Leah and the demon passes into her while Connie falls dead. Leah/Legion (who can now pass through doors) goes to confront Father Drake, revealing the name of the demon: Legion. They argue, Father... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"5ive Girls,\\" Alex, one of the five troubled and unwanted girls at St. Mark's Catholic boarding school, ultimately forces Legion, the demon possessing the girls, into the body of the malicious headmistress, Miss Pearce. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that all five girls possess supernatural gifts, but their hidden abilities lead to possession and chaos. A series of events leads Legion, the demon initially revealed through Connie's possession, to jump between the girls, ultimately reaching Leah. After Leah confronts Father Drake and reveals the demon's name, the girls devise a plan to deal with the demonic presence. Understanding the grave danger that Legion poses and relying on her telekinetic abilities, Alex takes decisive action, forcing the demon out of Leah's body and into Miss Pearce's. Miss Pearce, who secretly orchestrated the girls' arrival at the school for her nefarious purposes, suffers the consequences of her actions as the demon she hoped to control is now turned against her. By transferring Legion into Miss Pearce, the girls break free from the demonic influence, and the once-possessed Leah is spared. Unfortunately, the other girls who were previously possessed – Connie, Mara, and Cecilia – pay the ultimate price as they die from the torment of the demon during the course of the movie. The movie concludes with Alex and Father Drake taking a stand against Legion and its host, Miss Pearce, in a climactic battle with the forces of evil. The outcome of this confrontation determines the fate of the survivors as they face the demonic entity that has haunted their school."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the question In Rutherford's experiment, what caused some high-energy particles to bounce off the metal, while most pass straight through? Choose your answer from: a). light waves b). magnetic waves c). positive charges d). negative charges","completion":"In Rutherford's experiment, the factor that caused some high-energy particles to bounce off the metal while most pass straight through is c). positive charges. Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealand-born physicist, conducted the famous gold foil experiment in 1909. The experiment involved firing alpha particles - which are positively charged helium nuclei containing two protons and two neutrons - at very thin gold foil. Rutherford aimed to investigate the structure of atoms and the behavior of these high-energy particles as they interacted with the atoms within the gold foil. Three main observations were made during the experiment: 1. Most alpha particles went straight through the foil with little or no deflection. 2. Some particles were deflected at significant angles. 3. A few particles bounced back almost directly towards the source. Before the gold foil experiment, the prevailing model of atomic structure was J.J. Thomson's \\"plum pudding model.\\" This model postulated that the atom's positive charge was evenly distributed throughout a sphere, with negatively-charged electrons embedded in it. Rutherford's observations, specifically the deflection and bouncing back of some alpha particles, contradicted the plum pudding model. Since most of the alpha particles passed through the foil without deflection, it indicated that atoms are mostly empty space. The instances where the alpha particles bounced back or were deflected at large angles revealed that there must be a small, dense, positively-charged center within each gold atom - what is now known as the nucleus. Rutherford concluded that the gold atom's positive charges (found in the nucleus) were responsible for repelling the positively-charged alpha particles. The closer the alpha particles got to the nucleus of a gold atom, the stronger the repulsive force, resulting in more significant deflection or even bouncing back. This observation led Rutherford to propose a new model of the atom, known as the Rutherford model or \\"solar system model\\". In this model, a central nucleus containing positively-charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons is surrounded by negatively-charged electrons, which orbit the nucleus much like planets orbit the sun. Although this model has been further developed and refined through quantum mechanics, Rutherford's experiment established the foundation for our modern understanding of atomic structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is the formation of magma within the Earth's mantle or crust. Here's a detailed explanation of the complete process, now including the missing first step: 1. Formation of magma: Magma is formed by the partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust. This occurs when heat and pressure beneath the Earth's surface rise, causing the solid rocks from Earth's mantle or crust to melt partially. The melted rock, also known as magma, is less dense than the surrounding solid rocks. Magma composition varies based on the rocks that were melted, ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: As magma forms, dissolved gases from the deep Earth, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other volatile elements, are released into the magma. These gases reduce the magma's density further and create buoyancy, which drives the magma upward through the Earth's crust. The magma and gas mixture begins to rise towards the surface, moving along fractures or weak areas in the Earth's crust. 3. The magma cools: As magma rises closer to the Earth's surface, it begins to cool and crystallize slowly. The cooling magma turns into solidified rock called igneous rock. During this process, some gas may be trapped within the cooling magma, resulting in the formation of bubbles or vesicles in the solidified rock. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: If the magma continues to rise and encounters a barrier, such as a thick layer of crust, it may accumulate in a magma chamber. Over time, the magma within the chamber continues to cool and solidify, and the trapped gases exert even greater pressure on the surrounding rocks. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: When the pressure within the magma chamber becomes too great, it can cause the overlying rocks to fracture and release the pressure in the form of an explosion. This explosive eruption propels the magma, now called lava, and volcanic gases out of the Earth's surface, forming a volcanic cone or a fissure eruption. Depending on the magma's composition and gas content, volcanic eruptions can vary in style, from effusive lava flows to highly explosive eruptions that produce ash and pyroclastic materials. This detailed process outlines the primary steps involved in the formation, ascent, and eruption of volcanic materials, with the first step being the formation of magma within the Earth's crust or mantle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Afterwards, Robert has to create waves with a short wavelength, waves that we will call short waves. But I can use this background: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is What is an answer for this question: Which waves will have a higher frequency? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, the waves with a higher frequency will be the short waves.

It must be experienced, realized, kindled within like a holy fire.\\" The term is also used to describe aspects of other religions and belief structures. - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin. - The Coronation of the Virgin or Coronation of Mary is a subject in Christian art, especially popular in Italy in the 13th to 15th centuries, but continuing in popularity until the 18th century and beyond. Christ, sometimes accompanied by God the Father and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, places a crown on the head of Mary as Queen of Heaven. In early versions the setting is a Heaven imagined as an earthly court, staffed by saints and angels; in later versions Heaven is more often seen as in the sky, with the figures seated on clouds. The subject is also notable as one where the whole Christian Trinity is often shown together, sometimes in unusual ways. Although crowned Virgins may be seen in Orthodox Christian icons, the coronation by the deity is not. Mary is sometimes shown, in both Eastern and Western Christian art, being crowned by one or two angels, but this is considered a different subject. - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood. - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland. - The Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, also known as Cuiavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship or simply Kujawsko-Pomorskie or Kujawy-Pomerania Province (in Polish, \\"województwo kujawsko-pomorskie\\" ), is one of the 16 voivodeships (provinces) into which Poland is now divided. It is situated in mid-northern Poland, on the boundary between the two historic regions from which it takes its name: Kuyavia and Pomerania. Its two chief cities, serving as the province's joint capitals, are Bydgoszcz and Toru. - Toru Voivodeship was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland in the years 19751998, superseded by the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. Its capital city was Toru. - Grudzidz (or \\"\\" or \\"Grudentia\\") is a city of 96 042 inhabitants (2010) on the Vistula River in northern Poland. Situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999), the city was in the Toru Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

Given the question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. suppose plenty of grease happens, how will it affect overworked burdened kidneys. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate on the answer, it's important to understand the function and process of the kidneys, as well as how the presence of excess grease might affect their function. The kidneys are critical organs responsible for filtering waste and excess substances, including fluid and electrolytes, from the blood. The process you described in the original question is called glomerular filtration, which is a crucial function of the kidneys. When there is an abundance of grease in the system, it can lead to several potential indirect effects on the kidneys: 1. Formation of kidney stones: Excessive grease in the diet may lead to an increased risk of kidney stones, which are solid masses of crystallized substances. These stones can obstruct the urinary tract, impede urine flow, and cause damage to the kidneys if left untreated. 2. Impact on blood pressure: A high-fat diet, rich in grease, can contribute to elevated blood pressure. High blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney damage as it puts additional strain on the blood vessels within the kidneys, eventually impairing their ability to filter waste and excess fluid from the blood effectively. 3. Atherosclerosis: Excess grease in the bloodstream may lead to atherosclerosis, a condition where plaques build up in the arterial walls, narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow to various organs, including the kidneys. This decreased blood flow can impair kidney function and lead to kidney damage. 4. Obesity: A diet high in grease typically contributes to weight gain and obesity, which is another risk factor for kidney disease. The increased load on the kidneys can exacerbate any existing kidney dysfunction, hindering their ability to effectively filter waste products from the bloodstream. 5. Inflammation: Increased intake of grease, especially if it is from unhealthy saturated and trans fats, can lead to inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is a contributing factor to the development of kidney disease and can hinder the kidneys' ability to perform their functions properly. It is essential to note that the presence of excess grease does not directly impact any individual step of the kidney filtration process but can have several indirect effects by increasing the risk of kidney stones, elevating blood pressure, leading to atherosclerosis, obesity, and inflammation. These factors can compromise kidney function over time, increasing the overall burden on the kidneys and contributing to the development or progression of kidney disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions(, ), the bases for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory. Memory can be defined as the capacity to keep information available for later use. It includes not only \\"remembering\\" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory is also involved when a six-year-old child learns to swing a baseball bat. Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices from storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory-storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant-access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 \\"words\\"--ready for instant use. An average prefix = st1 /U.

The Malaysian authorities are called upon for assistance by their Indian counterparts. The Indian team sent to Kuala Lumpur is headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police De Silva (Boman Irani), who targets the illegal drug operations of Singhania (Rajesh Khattar). Helping him along the way is Inspector Vishal Malik (Om Puri), an Indian officer from Interpol.

De Silva explains that Singhania had killed Vardhan upon learning that Boris was about to hand over his drug business to Vardhan. Singhania's subordinate, Don, is known for murdering one of his close associates, Ramesh (Diwakar Pundir), who had attempted to leave the cartel.

Article: If you are planning on traveling, there are few simple rules about how to make life easier both before and after your journey. First of all, always check and double-check departure time. It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting. The second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards , it is still important to have some local money in cash . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. \\"Listen! I only take real money!\\" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment. The third and the last rule is to find out as much as you can about the weather at your destination before you leave. I feel sorry for some of my workmates who travel in heavy suits and raincoats in May, when it is still fairly cool in London or Manchester, to places like Athens, Rome of Madrid, where it is already beginning to get quite warm during the day.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer.

The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom.Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain.The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian operative Olga Bariosova (Lesley-Anne Down), who makes the same mistake. When the real Clouseau arrives, he is perplexed by Olga's affections but learns from her Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria. Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau's apparent demise, but suffers from a toothache; Clouseau, disguised as a dentist, sneaks into the castle - eventually (his entry frustrated by the castle's drawbridge). Not recognized by Dreyfus, Clouseau ends up intoxicating both of them with nitrous oxide. Realising the deception when Clouseau mistakenly pulls the wrong tooth, Dreyfus prepares to use the machine to destroy England. Clouseau, eluding Dreyfus's henchmen, unwittingly foils Dreyfus's plans when a medieval catapult outside the castle launches Clouseau on top of the Doomsday machine. The machine begins to malfunction and begins firing on Dreyfus and the castle itself. As the remaining henchmen, Fassbender and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle, Dreyfus plays \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\\" on the castle's pipe organ, while himself disintegrating, until he and the castle vanish.Returning to Paris, Clouseau is finally reunited with Olga. However, their tryst is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle, and then by Cato, whereupon all three are hurled by the reclining bed into the Seine. Immediately thereafter, a cartoon image of Clouseau begins swimming, unaware that a gigantic version of the Pink Panther character is waiting below him (a reference to the film Jaws, made obvious by the thematic music as the movie ends).","completion":"Task Explanation: 1.

The Roots is an American hip hop band, formed in 1987 by Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments. Malik B., Leonard \\"Hub\\" Hubbard, and Josh Abrams were added to the band (formerly named \\"The Square Roots\\"). Since its first independent album-length release the band has released 10 studio albums, two EPs, two collaboration albums (with other artists), and also collaborated on recordings and in live shows with a wide variety of artists in many musical genres. The Roots originated in Philadelphia with Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson and Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter while they were both attending the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. They would busk out on the street corners with Questlove playing bucket drums and Tariq rapping over his rhythms. Their first organized gig was a talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots. In 1992, they dropped the \\"Square\\" because a local folk group had claim to the name. Organix was the band's first album, released and sold independently in 1993. It drew offers from music labels, and the band signed with DGC/Geffen. The Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??!, was released in 1994.

Touring guests, beatboxer Rahzel and producer Scott Storch, joined The Roots. The 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to break the Top 40 on the Billboard 200 chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \\"What They Do\\" (a parody of rap video cliches) and \\"Clones\\", which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts. \\"What They Do\\" was also the group's first single to hit the Top 40 of Billboard's charts, reaching a peak of #34.

Female fruit flies rid of the ability to smell food outlive their peers.The sense of smell may be linked to the cellular ageing process in many other organisms--even people.A link has recently been found between sensory experiences and lifespan in both worms and flies.For example, Scott Pletcher, a biologist at the University of Michigan, found that eliminating fruit flies' ability to smell enabled them to live nearly 20 percent longer than flies with an intact sense of smell. Pletcher's team reasoned that food smells were the ones most likely to affect ageing, as nutrition and longevity are known to be linked in many organisms.To test the idea that food odors affect lifespan, Pletcher's team eliminated flies' ability to smell carbon dioxide, which is produced by some fly foods.They left the rest of the smelling system intact. This intervention had no effect on male flies, but the females lived 30 percent longer than normal.Pletcher thinks eliminating the ability to smell CO2may deprive flies of information about food availability.This could signal to cells that food is scarce, causing processes that promote survival.Indeed, his team found that the CO2-insensitive female flies stored extra fat and that both males and females immune to CO2were more resistant to stress than normal flies.Pletcher isn't sure why the change in his fruit flies only affected the lifespan of the females, but he suggests that females may simply be more sensitive to the odor of CO2. A smell or taste that stretches lifespan in humans could be a potential preventative for age-related disease, he adds.Although in fruit flies it appears to be the smell of CO2that affects ageing, he says that an analogue in humans might be a smell or taste linked to human food--or a lack of it.Matt Kaeberlein studies ageing at the University of Washington in Seattle. He cautions that we don't know whether ageing and smell are linked in mammals.But \\" we definitely undergo physiological changes in response to smelling... Question: According to the results of Pletcher's study, we can see that _ . Options: A: male flies in general can live longer than female flies B: flies without ability to smell is inspired to find food in another way C: both male and female flies can live longer without the ability to smell D: flies without ability to smell can also get information about food availability The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: both male and female flies can live longer without the ability to smell"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emily brought her newly single friend, Jennifer, a huge box of chocolate with a ribbon on it because Choose your answer from: (a). Emily thought is would cheer her up. (b). Jennifer thought is would cheer her up.","completion":"(a). Emily thought it would cheer her up. Emily had been friends with Jennifer for many years. They had met in high school and had maintained their friendship throughout college and their adult lives. Despite the different paths their lives had taken, they remained incredibly close. Emily was happily married with a thriving business, while Jennifer had recently gone through a tough breakup. As a strong, empathetic, and supportive friend, Emily knew how difficult the end of a relationship could be. She remembered her own past breakups and how lonely and disheartening those times had been. So, when she saw the beautiful box of chocolate on sale at a local store, she immediately thought of Jennifer and how it might be the perfect small gesture to lift her spirits, even if only for a little while. With the box of chocolate beautifully wrapped and adorned with a ribbon, Emily drove over to Jennifer's apartment. She was excited at the prospect of cheering up her friend and planned to spend the evening with her, sharing stories, laughter, and indulging in the delicious chocolates together. Jennifer opened the door, her face visibly illuminated at the sight of her dear friend. She had been feeling particularly low that day, having spent hours scrolling through old pictures and memories she had shared with her now ex-boyfriend. Emily stepped inside, presenting Jennifer with the box of chocolate. \\"What's this for?\\" Jennifer asked, puzzled. \\"Just a little something to cheer you up,\\" Emily replied with a gentle smile. Jennifer hesitated for a moment, looking at the box and then back to Emily. She knew that her friend had a knack for understanding what others needed, often before they even realized it themselves. Jennifer couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and gratitude. She embraced Emily in a tight hug. \\"Thank you, Emily. I really needed this.\\" As the two friends settled in to share the box of chocolates, they spent the night talking about memories of the past, discussing current challenges, and dreaming about the future. Emily could see the dim light returning to Jennifer's eyes, her laughter growing more genuine and carefree as the evening went on. The chocolate, while a seemingly simple gesture, had worked its magic. It had opened the door for Jennifer to acknowledge her pain and sadness, but also to recognize the importance of friendship and the support it provides. Emily had given her a tangible reminder that she was not alone and a clear message that she was there to help her through the difficult times. That night, Emily's gift of chocolate symbolized more than just a sweet treat. It rekindled the spirit of hope, the power of friendship, and the promise of brighter days ahead. The bond between Emily and Jennifer grew even stronger, both of them knowing that no matter the challenges life brought their way, they would face them together with love, compassion, and, occasionally, a box of chocolate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: The Mole People Movie plot: A narration by Dr. Frank Baxter, an English professor at the University of Southern California, explains the premise of the movie and its basis in reality. He briefly discusses the hollow earth theories of John Symmes and Cyrus Teed among others, and says that the movie is a fictionalized representation of these unorthodox theories. Archaeologists Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin find a race of Sumerian albinos living deep under the Earth. They keep mutant humanoid mole men as their slaves to harvest mushrooms, their primary food source, since mushrooms can grow without sunlight. The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient Mesopotamia. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of Ishtar, which is really natural light coming from the surface. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural Caucasian skin who is disdained by the others since she has the \\"mark of darkness.\\" They believe the men are messengers of Ishtar, their goddess. When one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods. He orders their capture and takes the flashlight to control the Mole People, not knowing it is depleted. The archaeologists are then sent to the Eye just as the Mole People rebel. Adad goes to the Eye only to realize its true nature and that the men had survived. They then leave for the surface. Unfortunately, Adad dies after reaching the surface, when an earthquake causes a column to fall over and crush her. The answer is:","completion":"The archaeologists, Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin, find a race of Sumerian albinos living deep under the Earth.

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the Jumbo Knobs are \\"really helpful for the young ones.\\" This statement implies that the product is valuable for its intended audience, namely, young children. The reviewer also appreciates the product's design, specifically mentioning that it includes shapes. The fact that it incorporates different shapes likely makes the Jumbo Knobs more appealing and engaging for children, contributing to the product's positive review. Another aspect the reviewer comments on is their baby's continued enjoyment even after owning the product for several months. This is an essential factor in evaluating the quality of a product aimed at young children, as their interests can change quickly. The fact that their baby \\"has enjoyed it since we bought it at 9.5 months, and he still likes chewing on them at 11 months\\" illustrates that the Jumbo Knobs maintain a level of appeal and entertainment value for the baby.

Context: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

Select from: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","completion":"It is not possible to tell. The two sentences describe different aspects of the relationship between Egypt and the Soviet Union during the rule of Nasser. Sentence 1 states that Nasser ruled for 17 years, during which Egypt embarked on a modernization program with Soviet assistance. Sentence 2, on the other hand, acknowledges that some people believe the Soviets had ulterior motives in helping Egypt, possibly seeking to take over the country for themselves. While the first sentence is true, as Nasser indeed ruled Egypt from 1954 to 1970 and the modernization program with Soviet aid was indeed initiated, the truth of the second sentence cannot be definitively established based solely on the information provided. The fact that the Soviets helped Egypt in modernizing does not conclusively indicate that they also wanted to take over the country. The second sentence itself states that this viewpoint is disputed. Given that there are multiple perspectives on the Soviets' motivations, and considering the complex geopolitical context of the time, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the second sentence based solely on the information available in Sentence 1.

If \\"A surfer with a yellow board rides a wave.\\", can we conclude \\"A surfer is in a contest.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"A surfer is in a contest\\" based merely on the statement \\"A surfer with a yellow board rides a wave.\\" The given statement only provides specific information about a surfer's action (riding a wave) and a particular detail about their surfboard (its color being yellow). This information is not sufficient to infer the context of a contest. Surfing, as a sport or recreational activity, can take place under different circumstances and contexts. People often surf for leisure, practice, or just for fun without participating in any competitions. Consequently, just because someone is observed riding a wave, it does not necessarily imply that they are participating in a surf contest. Additionally, having a yellow surfboard does not inherently signify contest participation either. Surfboards come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, chosen based on the surfer's personal preference or the specific wave conditions they wish to tackle. The color of a surfboard does not usually indicate the surfer's competitive status. In order to conclude that a surfer is participating in a contest, more contextual information would be required. For example, if there are judges present, a group of competing surfers, or an announcer commentating throughout the event, these factors contribute to a stronger indication of a contest taking place. Overall, the statement \\"A surfer with a yellow board rides a wave\\" only establishes that a surfer is engaged in the act of surfing, but it does not provide enough information to support the conclusion that the surfer is in a contest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating possible offences committed in the aftermath. Of the 132 of those yet to respond, 64 are from South Yorkshire Police and 68 from West Midlands Police. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the crush in April 1989. In her latest update, IPCC Deputy Chair Rachel Cerfontyne said attempts to contact those \\"who have not assisted our investigation so far\\" was ongoing. She added: \\"Some were unable to provide an account for reasons such as poor health. Others have not responded to our contact and there are a number of individuals who couldn't be traced.\\" The potential witnesses had been identified because they may have useful information and further efforts would be made \\"to persuade this group to engage with us\\", she said. To date, the IPCC said it has recorded over 4,000 witness accounts, with about 1,200 of those coming from police staff. But while the watchdog can compel police witnesses who are still serving to give evidence it cannot compel retired officers to do so, Ms Cerfontyne said. A separate criminal investigation, Operation Resolve, is looking into the crush and the match day itself, A spokesman for Operation Resolve said the appeal had resulted in 41 possible identifications for 16 of the people. He said those sought were not suspected of wrongdoing but may have helpful information. The 19 people police want to trace were seen on CCTV at about 14:50 before the FA Cup semi-final, at the stadium's Leppings Lane end near exit gate C.

Please answer this question: electric wires are covered with rubber like material give reason?","completion":"Sure, I'd be happy to answer that question. The reason electric wires are covered with rubber-like material is mainly for safety and protection purposes. Step 1: Start With Basics Electricity is a form of energy resulting from charged particles such as electrons and protons, and it can produce heat, light, and cause chemical changes. Conductors like metal wires are used to transmit electricity due to their property of letting electrons move freely. Step 2: Understand the Danger However, this flow of electrons (electric current) through a conductor can be dangerous if we come into direct contact with it, because our bodies can also act as a conductor leading to serious risks such as electric shocks or fires. Step 3: Recognize the Protection Mechanism Insulators are materials that resist the flow of electric current. Rubber is a good insulator. Therefore, the electric wires are covered with a rubber-like material. Step 4: Confirm the Reason So, the main reason electric wires are covered with rubber-like material is to insulate the conductor (metal wire carrying current) and prevent electrical shocks or short circuits that could occur if live wires come in contact with each other or a human body. The rubber-like material also serves a secondary purpose of protecting the wires from external damage (like environmental elements or physical stress), which might impair their function. This reasoned and step-by-step approach makes it clear why electric wires need to have this layer of insulation in the form of a rubber-like covering."},{"prompt":"I heard that Casey had robbed a bank and he remained at large and was not even seen.

Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Article: Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger. The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \\"third child\\". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \\"child,\\" a \\"little angel\\", a \\"sufferer\\" and a \\"beloved little corpse.\\" In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \\"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship.\\" The two would never meet again.

Choices: - spring into action - accept his fate - cross street - feel upset - travel to europe The rationale to choose \\"spring into action\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"spring into action\\" because it is the most appropriate choice closely related to achieving one's dreams. The question mentions that the person knew what he had to do to achieve his dreams; therefore, the action he should take should be focused on pursuing those dreams. Let's analyze the other choices: 1. Accept his fate: This choice suggests passivity and resignation instead of actively pursuing one's goals and dreams. It's not aligned with the idea of knowing what one has to do and working towards achieving dreams. 2. Cross street: This choice seems unrelated and too specific to be applied to the broader concept of achieving dreams. It doesn't convey any meaningful action towards reaching personal goals. 3. Feel upset: This choice involves an emotional reaction but isn't an active approach to achieving dreams. It's also counterproductive as it suggests a negative response rather than proactively taking steps towards success. 4. Travel to Europe: While traveling can be a life-changing experience, it's not a generic answer that applies to the pursuit of dreams for everyone. Traveling to Europe might be relevant if the person's dreams were specifically connected to that location, but in this context, it doesn't make sense as the best answer. In conclusion, \\"spring into action\\" is the most suitable answer because it represents the initiative, motivation, and proactive approach necessary to achieve one's dreams.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Article: Their cheery song brightens many a winter's day. But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Question: What is the researchers' concern over the increase of birds' song output?

The sentiment of the statement is generally negative for the following reasons: 1. Use of the word \\"but\\": The word \\"but\\" introduces a contrasting or opposing idea that usually indicates some form of negative or less-than-desirable outcome. 2. Failure to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances: This suggests that the film adaptation did not manage to accurately represent the depth and emotional connections of the original novel. It is a critique on the film's ability to convey the intended emotions the novel possesses. 3. Distancing the audience from the characters: The word \\"distanced\\" implies a separation or detachment between the viewers of the film and the characters. This is, generally, an unfavorable outcome, as it means that the audience cannot connect or empathize with the characters, which is a crucial aspect in storytelling and the enjoyment of a film. 4. Irony: The use of \\"ironically\\" indicates that the intention to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances has led to the complete opposite result.

Article: Greater understanding of the importance of environmental enrichment in enhancing an animal's physical and social environment is bringing benefits for pet cats -- particularly those that are kept solely indoors. Our feline companions are very similar to their closest ancestor, the African wildcat, in terms of their behavioural needs; and an indoor-only lifestyle, unless managed appropriately, can give rise to health issues (such as obesity and diabetes) and problem behaviours (including aggression, house-soiling and attention-seeking). The latter can threaten the relationship between cat and owner, and in extreme cases even lead to euthanasia of the cat. One approach to mitigating these potential problems is with the use of 'food puzzles' -- devices that release food when an animal interacts with them and which were originally developed to provide enrichment for captive zoo and laboratory animals. Food puzzles take advantage of cats' natural instincts to work for their food. There is a wide range of puzzles on the market: some are mobile (rolled or pushed with the cat's nose or paws), others are stationary, and they can be used with either wet or dry food. For the creative and/or cost-conscious cat owner, DIY food puzzles can also be easily made; for example, by cutting holes in egg boxes or water bottles. The effect of food puzzles on cats is a relatively new area of study and a group of veterinarians and cat behaviour consultants in the USA provide a welcome addition to the peer-reviewed literature with a state-of-the art review in this month's Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery.1 As well as reviewing existing empirical evidence of the physical and emotional benefits imparted by food puzzles, the authors have collated details of over 30 cases from their own practices where food puzzles were introduced to aid with a specific health or behavioural concern. Examples include an obese 8-year-old male domestic shorthair cat who lost 20% of his bodyweight within 12 months of puzzle implementation; a 3-year-old British Shorthair male cat, whose impulsive and frustration-based aggression towards his owner instantly improved and resolved completely within 6 months; and a 2-year-old domestic shorthair cat whose fear of people (his owners included) significantly improved following the addition of both mobile and stationary food puzzles, to the point that he would come when called and was relaxed for cuddles. Cats are likely to have individual preferences in terms of types of food puzzles, and there may be some initial owner reluctance to overcome. The authors offer valuable practical advice, with a checklist of pointers for choosing a starter puzzle and guidance on how to implement food puzzles, as well as tips for troubleshooting potential challenges, such as owner concerns about night-time noise or having food scattered around the home. Given time, patience and appropriate introduction, most, if not all, cats can adjust to food puzzles. So much so, in fact, that the authors' advice extends to methods for increasing the difficulty of food puzzles for 'advanced foragers'! Ultimately, the end goal is to have several types of puzzles available and for all of the cat's meals to be provided by this enriching means. ||||| PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Many pet cats are kept indoors for a variety of reasons (eg, safety, health, avoidance of wildlife predation) in conditions that are perhaps the least natural to them. Indoor housing has been associated with health issues, such as chronic lower urinary tract signs, and development of problem behaviors, which can cause weakening of the human-animal bond and lead to euthanasia of the cat. Environmental enrichment may mitigate the effects of these problems and one approach is to take advantage of cats' natural instinct to work for their food. AIM: In this article we aim to equip veterinary professionals with the tools to assist clients in the use of food puzzles for their cats as a way to support feline physical health and emotional wellbeing. We outline different types of food puzzles, and explain how to introduce them to cats and how to troubleshoot challenges with their use. EVIDENCE BASE: The effect of food puzzles on cats is a relatively new area of study, so as well as reviewing the existing empirical evidence, we provide case studies from our veterinary and behavioral practices showing health and behavioral benefits resulting from their use. © The Author(s) 2016. |||||Summary:","completion":"A recent article explains how environmental enrichment is important for pet cats, especially those kept indoors. Cats share similar behavioral needs with their ancestor, the African wildcat, and keeping them indoors may cause health issues and bad behavior. 'Food puzzles' can help solve this problem by letting cats work for their food, which is something they do naturally. There are many types of food puzzles available for purchase, or people can make them at home. When cats use food puzzles, they are happier and healthier. This idea is still new, but studies have shown very good results for cats who use food puzzles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

See options at the end The wet hair would not fit in the hat because the Pick from: 1). hat is too compact.; 2). hair is too compact.;","completion":"The wet hair would not fit in the hat because the hat is too compact. This choice is more plausible because it implies that the hat's size or structure is not spacious enough to accommodate the wet hair comfortably. The word \\"compact\\" in this context communicates that the hat's dimensions are small and that it doesn't afford enough room to hold the added volume or dampness of the wet hair. This could be due to the hat being designed for a smaller head size or having a tighter, more rigid construction. On the other hand, the second option – \\"the hair is too compact\\" – does not convey a clear or sensible explanation for the reason the wet hair is not fitting in the hat. The compactness of the hair would refer to the hair being pressed closely together or tightly knit. However, it would not logically explain why wet hair wouldn't fit into a hat, as compact hair should theoretically take up less space rather than more. In more detail, when hair is wet, it becomes heavier and might stick together, which could cause it to have difficulty fitting inside a hat, particularly if the hat is too small or tight. This is due to the combination of water being absorbed in the hair strands, causing them to expand, and the added weight from the absorbed water making the hair bulkier. The soaking effect of the water can cause the hair to clump together, which might lead to the notion of the hair being too compact. However, this concept is less logical and less likely to result in difficulty fitting the hair into the hat as compared to the hat itself being too compact. Therefore, the more accurate and sensible choice is to conclude that, \\"The wet hair would not fit in the hat because the hat is too compact.\\" This option pinpoints the issue at the hat instead of the hair, providing a clearer understanding of why wet hair might have difficulty fitting in it. In real-life situations, a hat might need to be adjusted, resized, or even replaced to accommodate wet hair comfortably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maybe we said something that hurt their feelings or didn't share our toys with them. If we can understand why they said \\"no,\\" then we can learn how to be better friends. Next, we should think about our current relationship with that person. Are we already friends, or do we just know each other from school? Sometimes, if we don't know someone very well, that person might be unsure or nervous about being our friend. Spending more time together might help them feel more comfortable, but we should never force someone to be our friend. Now, let's examine our approach. Did we ask the person to be our friend nicely, or did we yell or say something mean? We should always try to be friendly and polite when we talk to others. If we made a mistake, it's okay; we just need to try to be better next time. It is also very important to respect their answer. If someone says they don't want to be our friend, we should say, \\"That's okay,\\" and don't ask them again and again. This is a big word called \\"respect,\\" and it means to understand and accept someone's feelings and choices. Lastly, we need to be patient. Sometimes, people need time to think or feel more comfortable before they can be our friend. While we are waiting, we can still be nice and friendly, but we should also try to make new friends too. There are so many people in the world, and we might find someone who wants to be our friend right away. In conclusion, it's essential to remember that not everyone will want to be our friend, and that's okay. When we face rejection, we can learn from it and become even better at making friends. We need to understand why they rejected us, think about our relationship, examine our approach, respect their answer, and be patient. Now, go out there, little buddy, and keep being your amazing, friendly self!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who really has all the power and directs the critical decisions of the Earth? Who really has all the power and directs the critical decisions of the USA? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To answer the first question: \\"Who really has all the power and directs the critical decisions of the Earth?\\" Step 1: Analyze the question to determine its scope. The question is about the power dynamics on a global scale and emphasizes critical decisions pertaining to the entire Earth. Step 2: Consider the structure of decision-making on Earth. There is no centralized authority or individual who has all the power or makes critical decisions for the entire Earth. Power is distributed among sovereign nations, international organizations, corporations, non-governmental organizations, and individuals. Step 3: Provide an answer based on the analysis. No single entity or individual has all the power or directs the critical decisions of the Earth. Power is held by various sovereign nations, international organizations, corporations, NGOs, and individuals, who come together to make decisions on a global scale. To answer the second question: \\"Who really has all the power and directs the critical decisions of the USA?\\" Step 1: Analyze the question to determine its scope. The question concerns the power dynamics and critical decision-making in the United States. Step 2: Examine the political structure and systems in the USA. The US is a federal republic with a representative democracy, and power is divided among federal, state, and local levels. The decision-making process involves the President, Congress, the judicial system, corporations, and citizens. Step 3: Provide an answer based on the analysis. No single entity or individual has absolute control or directs critical decisions of the USA. Power is shared among the President, Congress, the judicial system, corporations, and individual citizens. Decision-making processes involve the collaboration of these various parties. Finally, to determine if these questions are the same: Step 1: Compare the scope and subject matter of the questions. The first question is about the power dynamics on a global scale, whereas the second question focuses on the power dynamics within the USA. Step 2: Analyze the differences and similarities. While both questions address power dynamics and decision-making, they differ in scope and context, with one pertaining to the entire Earth and the other specific to the USA. Step 3: Provide an answer based on the comparison. No, the questions are not the same, as they address different power dynamics and decision-making contexts: global (Earth) versus national (USA)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. Question: Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? Answer: A:","completion":"The babies had to go to the NICU because they were born prematurely and were too tiny to breastfeed properly, requiring milk to be given through a feeding tube.

His partners were attracted to his vivacity and independence, but as they learned about his absolute disinterest in marriage, some chose to walk away, seeking a more committed future elsewhere. Step 5: Show the impact on their friendship. As years went by, Benjamin and Justin's friendship remained strong despite their different views on marriage. They learned to respect each other's choices and experiences, often seeking each other's advice during challenging times. Their friendship, built on understanding and acceptance, showed that people can hold opposing beliefs yet still maintain a deep and lasting bond. In conclusion, the story portrays Benjamin and Justin's contrasting beliefs about marriage, exploring their differing experiences in relationships and the impact on their friendship. By focusing on their individual journeys and their ability to maintain a strong bond despite these differences, it demonstrates that contrasting views on life can coexist and even enrich friendships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kristen says the idea came to her after she saw how much vaster she and her three college roommates generated on a daily basis.The Fine Arts student began to dream about transforming the deserted bags and packages into beautiful garments. Her first dress' made from plastic bags and rolled magazines was strange, fun and even charming.However, she only made it to test her creativity. The young designer did not consider starting a commercial venture until she spent a week working at Couture Fashion Week in New York City.There she observed the excitement generated by new and vintage looks and decided to see if her unusual idea would result in as much enthusiasm.She began by creating a line of 12 garbage-inspired dresses.They were a huge success. Today her company that has offices in Palm Beach, Florida and New York City, produces a wide variety of dresses ranging from cocktail dresses to ball gowns .Kristen, of course, doesn't search garbage cans for her material anymore.Instead, she seeks it from companies that have produced more than they need and are planning to throw away the extras. However, if you think the garbage-inspired dresses come cheap, think again.The price for ready-made creations retails from 500 to 1,500.Though that may appear expensive, the designer says she has no shortage of customers.In fact she now even has garbage-inspired clothing for men that includes jackets, ties, trousers and even board shorts!

Movie title: Battle for the Planet of the Apes Context: Told as a flashback to the early 21st century with a wraparound sequence narrated by the orangutan Lawgiver (John Huston) in \\"North America - 2670 A.D.\\", this sequel follows the ape leader Caesar (Roddy McDowall) years after a global nuclear war has destroyed civilization. In this post-nuclear society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between the apes and the surviving humans. A gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this and plots Caesar's downfall. Caesar is married to Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female ape of the previous film, and they have a son named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's father. Caesar regrets never having known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) tells him about an archive film of his parents where he can also learn about the future. The archives are located in the Forbidden City, now a radioactive ruin. After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory, Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives. However, there are mutants (radiation-scarred humans) still living there under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden). Caesar and his party view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn about the future of the world, but barely have time to study the tapes before they have to escape being captured. Caesar assembles a meeting to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up and he leads the gorillas away. A team of scouts sent by Governor Kolp return and tell him about the Ape City. Kolp considers this covert trip by Caesar an act of espionage. His assistant MÃ©ndez (Paul Stevens) believes they did nothing wrong and should be left alone, but Governor Kolp stubbornly declares war on Ape City, mustering the mutant humans to destroy the ape society. Aldo is furious that Caesar wants to co-exist peacefully with humans and plots a coup d'Ã©tat in order to become the Ape leader himself. Cornelius overhears...

Information: - Pierre Marie Félix Janet (30 May 1859 24 February 1947) was a pioneering French psychologist, philosopher and psychotherapist in the field of dissociation and traumatic memory. - Elizabeth F. Loftus (born Elizabeth Fishman, October 16, 1944) is an American cognitive psychologist and expert on human memory. She has conducted extensive research on the malleability of human memory. Loftus is best known for her ground-breaking work on the misinformation effect and eyewitness memory, and the creation and nature of false memories, including recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. As well as her prolific work inside the laboratory, Loftus has been heavily involved in applying her research to legal settings; she has consulted or provided expert witness testimony for hundreds of cases. Loftus has been recognized throughout the world for her work, receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the \\"Review of General Psychology\\"s list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list. - Hungry for Monsters is a 2003 documentary by George Paul Csicsery ( b , 1948 ) about false memory , focussing on Nicole Althaus ' disproved allegations of sexual abuse against her father , made when she was 15 years old . - False memory syndrome (FMS) describes a condition in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by memories that are factually incorrect but that they strongly believe. Peter J. Freyd originated the term, which the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) subsequently popularized. The term is not recognized as a psychiatric illness in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-5; however, the principle that memories can be altered by outside influences is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists. - False memory is the psychological phenomenon in which a person recalls a memory that did not actually occur. False memory is often considered in legal cases regarding childhood sexual abuse. This phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. Freud wrote \\"The Aetiology of Hysteria\\", where he discussed repressed memories of childhood sexual trauma in their relation to hysteria. Elizabeth Loftus has, since her debuting research project in 1974, been a lead researcher in memory recovery and false memories. False memory syndrome recognizes false memory as a prevalent part of one's life in which it affects the person's mentality and day-to-day life. False memory syndrome differs from false memory in that the syndrome is heavily influential in the orientation of a person's life, while false memory can occur without this significant effect. The syndrome takes effect because the person believes the influential memory to be true. However, its research is controversial and the syndrome is excluded from identification as a mental disorder and, therefore, is also excluded from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. False memory is an important part of psychological research because of the ties it has to a large number of mental disorders, such as PTSD. - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.

Though you could choose any major you want, it's best to study something like physiology, biology, or social science. These majors will help you build the prerequisite skills for medical school.","completion":"After obtaining a bachelor's degree in a science-related major, the next steps to become an endocrinologist are as follows: 1. Take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT): This standardized, multiple-choice test is an essential part of the medical school admissions process. It is designed to assess your problem-solving, critical thinking, and knowledge of foundational science concepts necessary for the study of medicine. Begin preparing for the MCAT during your undergraduate studies by engaging in study groups and utilizing test preparation resources. 2. Apply to medical school: Research and apply to medical schools that best align with your professional and personal goals. Medical schools typically require prerequisite courses in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and English. Provide your MCAT scores, letters of recommendation, and create a compelling personal statement as part of your application. 3. Complete medical school: Medical school generally takes four years to complete and consists of two phases: preclinical and clinical. During the preclinical phase, which typically lasts for the first two years, you will study medical theory and foundational science courses. In the clinical phase, you will engage in rotations through various medical specialties to gain hands-on experience in a supervised setting. 4. Choose your specialty: As you near the end of medical school, you should decide to specialize in endocrinology. This specialty focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of hormone-related disorders, such as diabetes, thyroid diseases, and reproductive health issues. 5. Complete a residency: After graduating from medical school, you will need to enter a residency program in internal medicine, which usually takes three years to complete. Throughout your residency, you will practice under the supervision of experienced physicians and gain more in-depth knowledge in your chosen specialty. 6. Pursue a fellowship in endocrinology: Once you have completed your residency in internal medicine, you must then complete an additional two- to three-year fellowship in endocrinology. During your fellowship, you will receive specialized training in diagnosing, treating, and managing hormone-related disorders. 7. Obtain board certification: After completing your fellowship in endocrinology, you will need to become board certified by passing the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Certification Exam. This exam tests your knowledge and clinical judgment in the field of endocrinology. 8. Obtain state licensure: As a medical professional, you will need to apply for and obtain a state medical license to practice medicine legally in your state.

The text states that Mark Arm, born as Mark Thomas McLaughlin, is the vocalist for the grunge band Mudhoney. The text also mentions that his former group, Green River, is one of the first grunge bands, which confirms his involvement in both of the mentioned bands. Mudhoney, formed in 1988, is best known for its early releases on the Sub Pop label. Their music has been influential in shaping the grunge genre, with a sound characterized by heavy distortion, fuzz, and feedback. Mudhoney has built a dedicated fan base throughout its career and is still active today, with Mark Arm as their frontman. Green River, on the other hand, had a shorter lifespan, existing from 1984 to 1988. However, despite its relatively brief existence, the band played a crucial role in the development of the grunge sound and paved the way for many bands that came later, including Mudhoney. Green River's lineup featured key members who later went on to form influential bands like Mudhoney and Pearl Jam. In addition to his contributions as a vocalist to Mudhoney and Green River, Mark Arm has also worked in various other roles. The text explains that he is the manager of the Sub Pop warehouse, a position that has likely provided him with a unique perspective on and involvement in the Pacific Northwest's music scene. Furthermore, he previously worked at Fantagraphics Books, which publishes and distributes alternative and underground comics, graphic novels, and additional art-related media, which demonstrates his broader involvement in the arts and counterculture. In conclusion, the sentence that Mark Arm has been in both Mudhoney and Green River is accurate, as the text explicitly states Mark Arm's affiliation with both bands. Additionally, Arm's creative and professional experiences further solidify his status as a key figure in the grunge music scene and the broader Pacific Northwest artistic community."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A:","completion":"Assuming this task involves understanding the given situation and making an inference on Taylor's feelings, here are the steps I would undertake: 1. First, I will analyze the given scenario. In this case, Remy was terrified of flying and Taylor managed to allay Remy's fear by assuring them about the safety of flying. 2. In analyzing relationships between emotions and actions, it's often seen that when a person consoles another, they usually feel satisfaction or relief after successfully reassuring the other person. 3.

Background: Aaron Charles Carter was born on December 7, 1987, at the Tampa General Hospital in Tampa, Florida, where his parents, Jane Elizabeth (nee Spaulding) and Robert Gene Carter (1952-2017), ran the Garden Villa Retirement Home. The family was originally from New York City, where his older brother Nick, of the boy band Backstreet Boys, was born. In addition to his brother Nick, he also has three sisters: twin sister Angel (a model), B.J. and Leslie (1986-2012). Carter is named after his paternal grandfather, Aaron Charles Carter, and his maternal grandfather, Douglas \\"Charles\\" Spaulding. Context: Carter's next album, Another Earthquake!, was released on September 3, 2002, during the \\"Rock, Rap, and Retro\\" tour. The album featured the patriotic-themed \\"America A.O.\\" and the ballad \\"Do You Remember\\". He guest starred on three episodes of the Nickelodeon TV show, All That and sang the theme song to the PBS animated series Liberty's Kids, titled \\"Through my own Eyes.\\" During that time, Carter's parents filed a lawsuit against his former manager, Lou Pearlman (now deceased), in 2002 alleging failure to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties on Carter's 1998 album, which was released through Pearlman's label and production company, Trans Continental. On March 13, 2003, Pearlman was declared in contempt of court for ignoring a court order to produce documents relating to royalty payments.

Here is an article: Nick Clegg's office sent out private briefings to Liberal Democrat MPs on Monday urging them to condemn Theresa May's plans to pull out of all EU judicial co-operation as an example of Eurosceptic Tory dogma being put before the need to keep UK families safe from criminals. In a sign of the scale of the rift at the top of the coalition, the briefing paper says the home secretary's decision represents \\"an open goal for the Liberal Democrats\\". The briefing paper, written by Ed Webber, the special adviser to the Lib Dem leader on EU affairs, also questions whether the prominent Tory party backer Lord Ashcroft can support opting out of the 130 EU co-operation measures, including the European arrest warrant. The charity Crimestoppers, founded by Ashcroft, has used the European warrant to arrest more than 50 British fugitives hiding elsewhere in Europe, the briefing paper points out. Due to the severe divisions between Tories and Lib Dems on the matter, May told MPs that the coalition was minded at present to opt-out of all EU judicial co-operation en bloc but was unable to say which forms of co-operation she would seek to negotiate back into. She stressed that, in many cases, she might seek memorandums of understanding rather than opt-ins. Negotiating individual opt-ins would represent a challenge for Britain as it would require the agreement of its European partners. Some countries, such as Bulgaria, might demand free movement of its citizens within the UK in return for letting Britain back in, it was suggested. The European commission might impose higher administration costs for police co-operation on the UK as a result of the opt-out. May is required to state by June 2014 whether or not Britain will retain the 133 European crime-fighting and justice measures, including the European arrest warrant. After that deadline, the European court of justice would have greater powers over EU police co-operation in the UK. The opt-out would mean all European judicial co-operation measures would cease to apply to the UK by December 2014. David Cameron will attend a European heads of government summit in Brussels this week, where he will seek to defend UK banking interests from EU plans for greater banking co-operation. There are doubts about the effectiveness of any UK veto in this area. A group of cabinet ministers led by the education secretary, Michael Gove, has let it be known that Britain should leave the EU if its demands for a repatriation of powers are not met. The Foreign Office is undertaking a systematic inquiry into the balance of powers, which is likely to be completed by 2014 in time for the Conservative party to make a manifesto commitment on a referendum. May is opposed to plans for a European-wide public prosecutor with powers of investigation and arrest across member states. She says the European arrest warrant has been used disproportionately, pointing out that Britain hands over many more suspects to other countries than it receives to face justice in the UK. In February 102 Tory backbenchers signed a letter, published in the Telegraph, calling on the government to pull out of all of these measures. In August 13 senior former UK police and security chiefs, including a former head of MI5, signed a letter to the prime minister warning that pulling out of many of these measures risked putting national security, public safety and the UK's reputation and international leadership in this area at risk. The Lib Dem briefing paper states: \\"This is about Eurosceptic Tories wanting to make it harder for the UK police to catch criminals, counter-terrorism and keep our streets and our families safe from dangerous criminals. They have put themselves in an extraordinary position and this is an open goal for the Liberal Democrats. \\"There are thousands of cases where the police have used these measures to catch criminals abroad and deport dangerous foreign criminals from the UK, including one of the failed 21/7 London bombers. Only this year, the home secretary and prime minister's local police force, Thames Valley police, secured the arrest of a man wanted for 15 child sex offences as result of a joint investigation between Thames Valley and Danish police.\\" Write a title for it.","completion":"UK Political Parties Disagree on EU Judicial Cooperation Plans"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that, due to feeling overwhelmed, the individual has decided to watch content for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. It seems plausible that these actions are being taken to reduce the feeling of being inundated and to manage their consumption in a healthy manner. The hypothesis is a possible explanation of the premise, as it proposes a direct connection between the feelings of being overwhelmed and the decision to set a time limit in the morning and evening. Conclusion: Given the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that if the premise is true - that the individual almost felt like it was too much and found themselves restricting their viewing to a couple of hours a day (one in the morning and one in the evening) - then it is likely that the hypothesis is true as well. The hypothesis aligns with the premise by explaining the possible reasoning behind the individual's decision to limit their consumption. It focuses on their self-awareness and self-restraint, offering a plausible explanation for their actions, and thus supports the likelihood of the premise holding true. However, it is important to note that while the hypothesis seems valid and strongly connected to the premise, other external factors, different viewpoints, and alternative explanations could influence the relationship between the two. As a result, although the hypothesis is a possible explanation that is likely true if the premise is true, it is not the only explanation. The analysis, in this case, is based solely on the given information, and there may be other factors at play that we are not aware of."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation. These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space, and the first two-stage rocket, the WAC Corporal-V2 combination, in 1949. The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army's new Redstone Arsenal, located in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950. From here, von Braun and his team would develop the Army's first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the Redstone rocket, that would, in slightly modified versions, launch both America's first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions. It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets.

Second question: Which are the best books to read on Indian history? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What are the best books on contemporary history of India? Contemporary history of India generally refers to the period from the time of India's independence in 1947 to the present day. Many books have been written covering different aspects of this modern history. The best books on contemporary history of India are those that provide an in-depth understanding of the nation's political, social, and economic developments. Some of the prominent books in this category are: 1. \\"India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy\\" by Ramachandra Guha: This comprehensive and well-researched book provides an extensive overview of India's political journey from the time of Independence to the early 21st century. Guha covers the highs and lows of politics and delves into the biographies of key political leaders. 2. \\"The Argumentative Indian\\" by Amartya Sen: This book is a collection of essays on Indian history, culture, and identity by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. The essays provide insights into India's historical traditions of public debate and intellectual pluralism. 3. \\"The Emergency: A Personal History\\" by Coomi Kapoor: This book recounts the 21-month period of political crisis from 1975 to 1977 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India, suspending civil liberties and elections.

The author delves into the ideas and individuals who have shaped the course of Indian democracy while confronting contemporary challenges. Second question: Which are the best books to read on Indian history? When asking about the best books on Indian history, it usually refers to a broader scope, spanning the entire historical timeline of India, from ancient to modern times. Some key books on the subject include: 1. \\"A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India\\" by Upinder Singh: This book provides an in-depth account of India's history from the earliest civilizations, such as the Indus Valley civilization, through to the early medieval period. 2. \\"India's Ancient Past\\" by R.S. Sharma: This is another essential book for those interested in ancient Indian history, covering political, economic, and social development from the Stone Age to the 12th century. 3. \\"The Discovery of India\\" by Jawaharlal Nehru: Written by India's first prime minister, this book is regarded as both a historical classic and a philosophical work, exploring India's rich cultural past, as well as its role in the fight for freedom and the formation of a modern, secular, democratic state. 4. \\"Ashoka: The Search for India’s Lost Emperor\\" by Charles Allen: This book delves into the life of one of India's most famous emperors, Ashoka Maurya, and the impact of his reign on Indian history. 5. \\"Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire\\" by Alex von Tunzelmann: This book provides a compelling and detailed account of the complex events leading to India's independence and the subsequent partition of India and Pakistan.

Here, we'll explore both the positive and negative interpretations of the phrase: Positive Interpretation: 1. High Awareness: If a person is \\"wide-awake all the way,\\" it can mean that they are completely alert and attentive throughout a task or situation. This can often be seen as a positive quality, as being attentive allows one to focus and ensure that any task at hand is done efficiently and effectively. 2. Preparedness: Being 'wide-awake' can imply that someone is prepared for any challenge that may come their way, which can be seen as a positive trait. It reflects a person's ability to adapt and respond to changing situations with confidence. 3. Enthusiasm: The phrase can also be interpreted as a sign of enthusiasm or excitement, as someone who is wide-awake is often eager and willing to engage in activities. This kind of enthusiasm can be contagious and motivate others around them to be more engaged and proactive. Negative Interpretation: 1. Lack of Sleep: In some contexts, the phrase could be seen as negative, suggesting that the individual is experiencing sleep deprivation or is unable to sleep properly. This can be harmful to one's mental and physical health, as proper rest is essential for overall well-being. 2. Overstimulation: If someone is \\"wide-awake all the way,\\" it could indicate that they are overstimulated or experiencing an excessive amount of stress. This may lead to feelings of anxiety, irritability, or burnout over time, which can negatively impact one's personal and professional life. 3. Inability to Relax: The phrase might also suggest that a person has difficulty allowing themselves to relax or take a break from work or other responsibilities. This can lead to an unhealthy balance between work and personal life, which may contribute to increased stress and a diminished quality of life. In conclusion, the phrase \\"wide-awake all the way\\" does not have a definitive positive or negative connotation. Its interpretation depends on the context in which it is used and the perspective of the person analyzing it. It can communicate positive attributes such as alertness, preparedness, and enthusiasm, or negative qualities such as sleep deprivation, overstimulation, and an inability to relax."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: - White fixed the problem. - Circuit breakers. - Easily.

Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise presents a situation where White is holding two circuit breakers together and dismisses the problem as 'nothing,' which implies that the problem was resolved at least to some extent.

Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well. - The pig-footed bandicoot (\\"Chaeropus ecaudatus\\") was a small marsupial of the arid and semi-arid plains of Australia. The distribution range of the species was later reduced to an inland desert region, where it was last recorded in the 1950s; it is now presumed to be extinct. - Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka. - Bandicoots are a group of about 20 species of small to medium-sized, terrestrial marsupial omnivore in the order Peramelemorphia.

The internal revenue service (irs) establishes the maximum individuals can contribute to their 401 k every year. Your employer might also impose limits on you.","completion":"To invest successfully in your 401(k), it is crucial to understand the process and develop a sound strategy. Here is a comprehensive overview of the steps involved: 1. Understand the basics of a 401(k) plan: A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to contribute pre-tax dollars from your paycheck to a tax-deferred investment account. This investment account is managed by a financial institution on behalf of your employer. 2. Know your limits: As you mentioned, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) establishes the maximum annual contributions that can be made to a 401(k) plan. For 2021, the contribution limit for employees under the age of 50 is 19,500, while those aged 50 or older can contribute an additional 6,500 as a catch-up contribution, bringing their total to 26,000. Your employer may also limit the percentage of your income that you can contribute. 3. Assess your investment options: Your 401(k) plan will typically offer a range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. It's essential to research and understand these options to create a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance, investment objectives, and time horizon. 4. Determine your contribution amount: Based on your financial goals and current financial situation, you need to decide how much you want to contribute to your 401(k) plan. Keep in mind the IRS and employer-imposed limits and try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of your employer's matching contribution (if offered). 5. Set up payroll deductions: Once you've decided on a contribution amount, you'll need to set up payroll deductions through your employer's human resources or payroll department. Your contributions will be automatically deducted from your paycheck and deposited into your 401(k) account. 6. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio: It's important to regularly review your 401(k) investments and adjust your portfolio as needed. This process, known as rebalancing, ensures that your investments remain aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. You may need to rebalance your portfolio due to market fluctuations or changes in your personal circumstances. 7. Monitor fees and expenses: It's essential to be aware of the fees and expenses associated with managing your 401(k), as these can significantly impact your long-term returns. These fees may include administrative fees, management fees, and expense ratios for individual investment options. Make sure you understand the costs involved and seek lower-cost alternatives when possible. 8. Consider professional advice: If you're unsure about your investment choices or need help developing a comprehensive financial plan, consider seeking the assistance of a financial advisor. A financial professional can provide guidance and help you navigate the complexities of investing for retirement. 9. Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs): Once you reach the age of 72 (or 70½ if you turned 70½ before January 1, 2020), you'll be required to take minimum distributions from your 401(k) account. Be prepared to factor these RMDs into your overall retirement income strategy. 10. Stay informed and educated: Keep yourself updated on industry trends, legislation changes, and new investment options related to your 401(k) plan. Being knowledgeable about your retirement savings will help you make sound decisions and stay on track to achieve your financial goals. By following these steps and being proactive in managing your 401(k) investments, you can maximize the growth potential of your retirement savings and have peace of mind knowing you're working toward a secure financial future."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The 26-year-old's pregnancy came as a big surprise in January this year, but a very happy one. Chloe, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said she was considered \\"low risk\\" and despite her experiencing severe vomiting, known as hyperemesis gravidarum, and pelvic pain, known as symphysis pubis dysfunction, it was only her who suffered and the baby was \\"happy as Larry\\" throughout. But, on 8 September, she couldn't feel any movement. \\"I went in just to get checked out,\\" said Chloe. \\"I thought it would be fine and if something was wrong, I would probably have her that day.\\" But when nurses couldn't find a heartbeat, Chloe went for a scan. The nurse then asked for her hand. Less than 24 hours later, she had a stillbirth to deliver Phoebe-Quinn. \\"I was angry at first,\\" she said. \\"I just didn't understand why it had happened. It is terrifying.\\" And when she wanted to talk about it on Facebook, she lost 26 friends. \\"They just didn't want to hear about it,\\" she said. \\"It was like they thought you should be ashamed. People just don't want to discuss it when a baby is involved.\\" After a year of trying for a baby, Luke and Emma Block were thrilled to find they were expecting twins. But the couple from Faversham, Kent, soon discovered problems that would eventually lead to the death of their baby girl, Abigail. \\"It was our first scan,\\" said 40-year-old Luke. \\"They noticed there was a problem with the growth of one of the twins and that we might lose one of them. That is where it all began.\\" There was hope when Abigail made it to 36 weeks, born weighing only 1lb 6oz, while her brother, Ethan, was a healthy baby boy. But after five weeks in intensive care, it was time to say goodbye to one of their children. \\"We feel blessed we had that time with her,\\" said Luke. \\"Some parents don't, but with her, her eyes were open, we could change her nappy and we could be part of her care.\\" They also had new-born Ethan to think of. \\"The pain of losing a child is intense and even more so when you have a healthy baby to look after and get so much joy from,\\" he said. \\"At times we even felt guilty for feeling happy.\\" SOURCE: Stillbirth and Neonatal Death charity (Sands) Aimee and Michael Tulloch, from Birmingham, have had to endure the loss of three babies. After two rounds of artificial insemination (or IUI), Aimee became pregnant in 2013. But an infection at 23 weeks meant baby Eli only lived for four days, dying in his mother's arms. \\"That evening Michael and I left the hospital without our baby,\\" said the 37-year-old. \\"We left with a piece of our hearts missing.\\" In October 2014, another round of IUI saw Aimee become pregnant with twins. But, just before the 25-week mark, she went into hospital with Braxton Hicks contractions, her waters started to leak and real labour contractions began. Their baby girl, Storm, lived for just 17 minutes, while baby boy Isaiah made it to 11 hours. \\"Losing a child is a very lonely place,\\" Aimee said. \\"They will always be my children; I will always be their mum and want to talk about them. \\"I was very lucky with friends and family, although I lost one childhood friend, perhaps because she didn't know how to talk about it. \\"But I felt I had to manage their feelings. It makes people feel uncomfortable and then they end up saying stupid things like 'You can have another one.'\\" Leanne Louch and her partner Paul Seaman got a huge surprise when they found out in March they were expecting identical twins. But the Nottingham couple were left heartbroken after Thomas and Jack both died at 21 weeks gestation, before being born. \\"I was told there were extra risks but no-one went in-depth about what they were,\\" said 30-year-old Leanne. \\"I was getting scanned every two weeks and obviously you hear about things, but no-one talks about it.\\" During a weekend at the end of June, she started feeling some pains and on a Monday morning, one of her waters broke. \\"They told me if I could hang on until 24 weeks, they could give injections of steroids to help lungs develop,\\" she said. But by Wednesday, her second water had broken. On Thursday, doctors gave the couple the news that both boys had died. She then gave birth to the twins on Friday. \\"When I went for the post-mortem results, they said I could go out the backdoor rather than walk through the pre-natal clinic with everyone getting their scans,\\" said Leanne. \\"But I said no, I walked through that room with my head held high. I didn't do anything wrong.\\" Zoe Burdaky and her partner, Kyle Woollacott, are just weeks away from welcoming their child into the world. But less than a year ago they suffered the devastation of losing a daughter at 37 weeks. \\"It was a very straightforward pregnancy,\\" said 24-year-old Zoe. \\"There were no risk factors.\\" But, weeks before the due date, she stopped feeling movement. \\"We just thought we were being oversensitive,\\" said Kyle, who is also 24. \\"We thought they would just tell us everything was OK.\\" Instead, nurses said they could not find a heartbeat and there had been a clot. Baby Lily was delivered the next day, stillborn. \\"It was like a dream,\\" said Kyle. \\"Even when the baby was being born, we thought 'they've got it wrong.'\\" Being pregnant with their second child, with just a few weeks to go, has been an anxious time. \\"What I've found the hardest is when people ask if it's my first,\\" said Zoe. \\"I don't want to put people in that situation when they are being polite, but I want to acknowledge Lily.\\" Kyle said: \\"We are excited now but it is scary too and we are having scans every week.\\" If you need advice or support after experiencing baby loss, there are a number of charities who can help.

To do this, subtract 2*t from both sides of the equation: 2*t - 2*t + 151 = 12*t - 2*t - 49 151 = 10*t - 49 Step 3: Now, we want to isolate t completely. To do this, add 49 to both sides of the equation: 151 + 49 = 10*t - 49 + 49 200 = 10*t Step 4: Divide both sides by 10 to solve for t: 200 / 10 = 10*t / 10 20 = t So, the solution is t = 20."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They persuade a reluctant Allan Quartermain (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) to give them a lift to the coast in his wagon. Along the way, they encounter another wagon carrying two men in bad shape.

On the other side of the mountains, they are surrounded by unfriendly natives and taken to the kraal of their chief, Twala (Robert Adams), to be questioned. Twala takes them to see the entrance of the mines, guarded by the feared witch doctor Gagool (an uncredited Sydney Fairbrother).

Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped\\" can be analyzed on multiple levels, considering various aspects of language such as syntax, semantics, morphology, and pragmatics. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In this sentence, the syntax is relatively clear with a subject (Jason), a verb (whispered), and an object (the phoenix had escaped). It follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is standard and intelligible in English. However, some readers might argue that the sentence could be enhanced by inserting a conjunction such as \\"that\\" after the verb \\"whispered\\" for improved clarity. 2. Semantics: Semantics is concerned with the meaning conveyed by the sentence. The sentence's meaning is straightforward: Jason communicated, in a hushed manner, that the mystical bird known as the phoenix was no longer in captivity or restrained. The words used in the sentence are relatively simple and clearly convey the intended message. 3. Morphology: Morphology is the study of word formation and the structure of words. The sentence is composed of common words that follow standard morphological rules in English. \\"Jason,\\" being a proper noun, starts with a capital letter, and the verb \\"whispered\\" is in the past tense with the \\"-ed\\" suffix, correctly indicating a completed action. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is the study of how context influences meaning. This sentence is open to various interpretations depending on context. The sentence does not specify why Jason whispered this information, nor does it clarify where the phoenix was or to whom Jason was speaking. Some details about the characters and the environment surrounding them could have been provided. By doing so, the sentence would have offered a more comprehensive understanding of the context behind the statement. 5. Style and tone: The sentence is relatively simple and devoid of figurative language, making it easier to read and understand. However, more descriptive language or adjectives could be added to enhance the emotional impact or the visual imagery of the scenario. Furthermore, this sentence does not explicitly convey the urgency or the emotional reaction to the escape of the phoenix, which could prompt some critique. In summary, the sentence \\"Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped\\" showcases linguistic integrity in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. However, it could benefit from improvements in terms of context, style, and tone. The sentence may be considered adequate for casual conversation or informal writing.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water.\\" if \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water\\" if \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\" However, let us analyze both statements closely to see how they relate and how we can derive this conclusion. Statement 1: \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water.\\" In this statement, we are given a clear image of a dog that is in the water and is picking up a stick using its mouth. The statement also communicates that the dog is treading through the water, which means it is moving or swimming while carrying the stick. Statement 2: \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\" In this statement, we are given the information that a dog is retrieving a stick that has been thrown too far (overthrown) and has landed in the water. The dog's action of retrieving indicates that it is moving towards the stick, likely swimming in the water, in order to bring the stick back. Although the statement does not explicitly mention the dog picking up the stick with its mouth, it is reasonable to assume that this would be the method the dog would use, as it is a characteristic behavior of dogs when fetching objects. When comparing the two statements, we are given information about a dog in both, which involves the actions of swimming and retrieving a stick in the water. The goal or purpose of the dog's actions is the same: to acquire the stick. Considering these similarities and the fact that dogs typically use their mouths to pick up objects, we can safely conclude that the scenario described in Statement 1 - \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water\\" is a likely outcome or description of the situation presented by Statement 2 - \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\" Of course, one must remember that conclusions may not cover every detail and rely on the reader filling in some gaps, such as the method of retrieval (using the mouth) and the dog's movement (treading or swimming). However, it is reasonable to assume that the actions and situations described in both statements are closely related and support the conclusion that they depict the same event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Cook might just as well be gambling on what color tie President Clinton will wear tomorrow. Hypothesis: President Clinton will wear a t-shirt tomorrow. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we first need to analyze the components of the premise and hypothesis and their relationship. Premise: \\"Cook might just as well be gambling on what color tie President Clinton will wear tomorrow.\\" The primary focus of the premise is the uncertainty of the outcome, which is compared to the act of gambling. The statement implies that it is difficult to predict which color tie President Clinton will wear the next day. It anchors itself in a specific scenario: President Clinton wearing a tie with an uncertain color. Hypothesis: \\"President Clinton will wear a t-shirt tomorrow.\\" The hypothesis here is that President Clinton will wear a t-shirt the next day. Contrary to the premise, it does not involve a tie but presents an alternative scenario where he wears a t-shirt. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. A premise entails a hypothesis when the truth of the premise guarantees or leads to the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must necessarily be true because of their inherent logical relationship. In this case, the premise and hypothesis do not necessarily share a direct logical relationship. The premise focuses on the uncertainty of the color of the tie President Clinton will wear, while the hypothesis presents a distinct scenario in which he wears a t-shirt. The truth of the premise does not guarantee or lead to the truth of the hypothesis. For example, President Clinton might still wear a tie but of an unpredictable color, or he might wear something else entirely. However, the statements share a similar theme: uncertainty about President Clinton's choice of attire. Both the premise and the hypothesis address the unpredictability of his clothing decision, but they offer different possible outcomes. Moreover, accepting the premise that predicting President Clinton's tie color is uncertain doesn't negate the possibility that he might wear a t-shirt the next day. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the truth of the premise does not necessarily guarantee or lead to the truth of the hypothesis. While the premise and hypothesis share a common theme of uncertainty regarding President Clinton's attire, they each present separate outcomes and scenario possibilities, which do not rely upon a direct logical relationship between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Alien Nation Movie plot: The story takes place in Los Angeles in 1991. Three years prior an alien craft crash-landed on Earth. The saucer housed 300,000 \\"Newcomers\\", an extraterrestrial race of hard labor workers. With no way to return to their home planet, the Newcomers were first quarantined and then finally released to live among humans in the LA area.An LA police detective, Matthew Sykes, and his partner, Detective Tuggle, are patrolling an LA Newcomer neighborhood when they spot two of the aliens dressed in long black coats entering a small convenience store. The aliens pull out shotguns and rob the store's owner. Sykes and Tuggle intervene when the robbers emerge from the store and a gunfight ensues. One of the newcomers changes the magazine on his shotgun and begins to fire several powerful rounds that pass through the entire width of the car Tuggle is hiding behind. Tuggle is hit in the chest by one of the shots and dies immediately. Sykes, enraged at his longtime partner's death, takes off after Tuggle's killers.Rushing into a dark tunnel near the store, the Newcomer Sykes chases pulls out a small vial of blue fluid and deposits a small amount on his tongue. The substance is clearly a drug and the newcomer, invigorated by it's effects, furiously charges Sykes. Sykes fires several shots into the alien's chest, who seems unaffected at first but eventually drops. When Sykes is found by the backup that arrives, one of the officers tries to help him to his feet. When Sykes sees that the officer is a Newcomer, he violently pushes him away and hits him.The next day at his headquarters, Sykes joins his company for the morning debriefing. Everyone is saddened by Tuggles' death and their captain announces that they'll be taking in a new officer, someone who happens to be a Newcomer, the 1st one to be promoted to detective.

He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room.

The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: [i] no. [ii] yes.","completion":"[i] no. The two questions you posed focus on different aspects of fat loss, although they share the general theme of burning fat and enhancing fitness levels. I will answer each question individually in detail. 1. If you want to burn fat, is it better to walk or run? Determining whether walking or running is better for burning fat depends on several factors, including an individual's fitness level, weight, and personal preferences. In general, the more intense the exercise, the more calories are burned. Walking: Walking is a low- to moderate-intensity exercise that is more accessible for beginners or those who are not physically capable of more intensive activities. It is low-impact, making it suitable for individuals with joint or mobility concerns. When walking at a moderate pace, one typically burns about 300 to 400 calories per hour, depending on their weight. Running: Running is a high-intensity, high-impact exercise that helps you burn calories at a faster rate. Typically, one can burn around 600 to 1000 calories per hour when running, depending on factors such as speed, weight, and fitness level. From a purely calorific perspective, running would seem more effective in burning fat. However, the intensity of the exercise should also be considered. High-intensity workouts can raise your heart rate into the \\"aerobic\\" or \\"anaerobic\\" zones. Exercising in the \\"fat-burning zone\\" (~60-70% of your maximum heart rate) can potentially lead to higher fat oxidation rates, which could optimize fat loss. Moreover, personal preferences should be taken into account. If you enjoy walking and are more likely to stick with it, walking may be a better choice for you. The consistency of exercise is crucial in achieving long-term benefits. 2. How can I lose or reduce thigh and hip fat fast? It is important to understand that spot reduction, or the idea of losing fat from specific body areas, is a myth. Successful and sustainable fat loss happens through a combination of consistent exercise, proper nutrition, and an overall caloric deficit. To lose thigh and hip fat, it is essential to focus on the following: a. Cardiovascular exercises: Engage in regular cardiovascular activities like running, walking, cycling, or swimming to burn calories and improve overall fitness. b. Strength training: Incorporate lower body exercises such as squats, lunges, leg presses, and deadlifts into your fitness routine. This helps to build muscle and tone the thighs and hips while burning calories. c. High-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves alternating short periods of intense exercise with brief periods of active recovery. This type of training has been shown to increase fat burning and improve cardiovascular health. d. Nutrition: Consume a balanced diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and complex carbohydrates. Maintain a caloric deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn in a day. e. Patience and consistency: Remember that losing fat takes time and consistent effort. Focus on creating healthy habits and maintain a long-term perspective on fitness and weight loss. In summary, the two questions are different as one is primarily concerned with the better exercise modality for burning fat (walking or running), while the other focuses on losing fat from specific body regions (thighs and hips). In both cases, creating a calorie deficit through a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet is crucial for successful and sustainable fat loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league. Which players caught touchdown passes from Tom Brady in the first half?","completion":"In the first half of the game, Tom Brady threw touchdown passes to the following players: Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, and Rob Gronkowski. Amendola caught a 9-yard touchdown pass, Hogan scored on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, and Gronkowski secured a 53-yard touchdown as well.

I put the toy into the bucket as part of the process to clean it. The","completion":"toy, which was covered in dirt and grime from being played with outdoors for hours, desperately needed thorough cleaning and disinfection to ensure its continued use would be safe and enjoyable for the children. The bucket, filled with warm soapy water, was the first step in a multi-stage cleaning procedure designed to thoroughly remove all contaminants and preserve the toy's durability and appearance. As I submerged the toy into the soapy water within the bucket, I gently agitated the toy, ensuring that the mixture reached every crevice, seam, and surface to effectively break up and dissolve the stubborn dirt. The inclusion of a mild detergent in the water not only facilitated the removal of dirt but also helped to penetrate and remove any accumulated grease, sweat, and grime from the toy's surface. For areas that were particularly difficult to reach, I utilized a soft-bristled brush to scrub gently without causing damage to the toy's material. Following the initial cleaning, I removed the toy from the soapy bucket and rinsed it thoroughly under lukewarm running water, taking care to eliminate any residual soap and dislodged dirt. This step was crucial to avoiding soap build-up, which could cause skin irritation or even compromise the materials and colors of the toy. Once thoroughly rinsed, the toy was carefully inspected for any remaining stubborn stains or deposits. If necessary, the process of soaking and scrubbing in the bucket would be repeated to ensure a completely clean and sanitized surface. Additionally, at this stage, an optional disinfecting step could be included using a mixture of diluted bleach or a non-toxic disinfectant specially formulated for children's toys. The final step in the cleaning process involved air-drying the toy, either by placing it in an area with good air circulation or on a clean, dry towel to absorb any excess moisture. Drying the toy with direct sunlight was discouraged, as it could cause some toys to fade or become brittle over time. By the time the toy was fully dried and ready to be handled again, I could be confident that it was not only visually clean but also safely sanitized, ensuring hours of continued play and enjoyment for the children. Moreover, with regular cleaning and proper care, the lifespan of the toy would be significantly extended, maintaining its appearance and functional integrity for many fun-filled days to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Act introduced the concepts of assured tenancy and assured shorthold tenancy. It also facilitated the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit housing associations. Is the following statement correct based on the text is the housing act 1988 still in force","completion":"Yes, the Housing Act 1988 is still in force in the United Kingdom. However, it is essential to understand that various amendments have been made to the Act since its introduction, and some provisions have been replaced or updated by subsequent legislation. The Housing Act 1988 made significant changes to the private rented sector and the relationship between landlords and tenants in the UK. It aimed to encourage investment in the private rented sector by providing a new framework for tenancy agreements and greater protection for landlords through the introduction of assured tenancy and assured shorthold tenancy. Assured tenancies give tenants long-term security of tenure, and they can only be evicted based on specific grounds mentioned in the Act. Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) is a more common type of residential tenancy, which allows landlords to evict tenants without specifying a reason after the fixed term has ended (usually six months to one year) provided that proper notice is given. The Act also enabled the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit housing associations, which aimed to stimulate investment and promote housing diversification. This allowed housing associations to take on a more significant role in the provision of social and affordable housing. Since the Housing Act 1988, several other pieces of legislation and amendments have been introduced which impact the rented sector, including: 1. The Housing Act 1996, which adjusted the definition of homelessness and clarified priority need categories when applying for homelessness assistance. 2. The Housing Act 2004, which introduced the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) and mandatory licensing for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). 3. The Localism Act 2011, which amended the homelessness duty of local authorities, reduced the security of tenure for some new social housing tenants, and introduced the concept of \\"affordable rent\\" tenancies. 4. The Deregulation Act 2015, which reformed the requirements for serving a Section 21 notice to end an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. 5. The Tenant Fees Act 2019, which banned most letting fees charged to tenants and capped deposit amounts. Despite these subsequent legislations, the Housing Act 1988 remains in force and serves as the basis for modern private residential landlord and tenant law in the UK. However, it is crucial to consider the amendments and supplementary regulations when interpreting the current legal framework governing tenancies and landlord-tenant relationships in the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Yes, \\"know what their friend said\\" is a valid answer to the question, \\"Why did Addison do this?\\". Let me explain this in more detail. In the given scenario, Addison is holding the phone so that they can hear their friend talking. This action indicates that Addison wants to make sure they can clearly hear and understand the conversation taking place.

Fighting back: A group of prominent Hispanic women want an apology from ABC following remarks made by 'sources' on The View about Rosie Perez The View has come under attack from a group of prominent Hispanic women who say the recent treatment of reportedly ousted panel member Rosie Perez has been both racist and sexist. The actress is the center of much talk at the moment that she was fired as a present on The View after less than one season. She is currently on hiatus to perform in Broadway's Fish in the Dark, but insiders say she never adjusted to either the show's signature hard news/soft news chat format or reading a teleprompter. 'The brass at","completion":"ABC has deeply disappointed and offended a significant group of prominent Hispanic women with their recent actions and comments regarding The View's Rosie Perez,' the women said in a statement released to the media. 'We believe that ABC has a responsibility to address the serious allegations that have been made by sources on the show, as well as make a formal apology to Ms. Perez and the Hispanic community for these numerous missteps.' In recent weeks, various sources close to The View have made inflammatory and derogatory remarks about Rosie Perez, which have left many feeling that the treatment of the actress and host has been both racist and sexist. The comments have included statements that cast doubt on her intellect, professionalism, and effectiveness as a co-host, despite her notable accomplishments in her career and her sizable fan base. The sources have also fueled rumors that the network was planning to fire Perez, reportedly due to alleged difficulties in adjusting to the show's format and reading a teleprompter. The fact that these negative comments and insinuations have become public, without any official statement from ABC or The View to clarify or counter them, is a major cause for concern. It leaves the impression that the network and the show are either endorsing these views or turning a blind eye to the blatant disrespect shown to Rosie Perez and, by extension, to Hispanic women in general. It further perpetuates harmful stereotypes, such as the notion that Hispanic women, no matter their accomplishments, are less capable and intelligent than their non-Hispanic peers. As a result, the group of prominent Hispanic women is demanding that ABC take decisive action in this matter, not only by issuing a formal apology to Rosie Perez, but also by demonstrating a genuine commitment to diversity and inclusiveness on its network. This means not only hiring more Hispanic women at all levels, from cast and crew to executives, but also actively promoting a culture of mutual respect and understanding within the organization. By doing so, ABC can send a powerful message that racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination have no place in the entertainment industry or in our society at large. Moreover, because The View is a talk show that regularly discusses social issues, including race and gender, it is especially important that its panel members and the way they are treated on the show reflect the diversity and dignity of the people and viewpoints being discussed. The View's producers should seize this opportunity to model better behavior and showcase genuine respect for all of their panel members, regardless of race, gender, or other differences. The View has a longstanding history of showcasing strong, intelligent, and dynamic women of various backgrounds. The show has celebrated its ability to bring together differing perspectives and engage in meaningful conversations on a wide range of topics. This is why it is especially disheartening to witness the disrespectful treatment of Rosie Perez, a woman who embodies all of these qualities. In conclusion, the group of prominent Hispanic women is urging ABC to take responsibility for the hurtful comments made by sources on The View by issuing a heartfelt apology to Rosie Perez and striving to create a more diverse and inclusive environment on the show and at the network. By doing so, ABC can demonstrate a genuine commitment to respecting the dignity and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or background, and can help to move our society closer to true equality and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. Context: During the 1991-92 season, West Indies played mainly one-day cricket, taking part in tournaments in Sharjah--where Ambrose took seven wickets, including an analysis of five for 53--and Australia, and took part in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. In this tournament, Ambrose took seven wickets in seven games at an average of 33.57 and was the seventh most economical bowler among those who played more than one game. West Indies finished sixth in the qualifying table and failed to reach the semi-finals. Ambrose returned home to play twice for the Leeward Islands in January 1992. In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for the first time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, all of which were won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing regulation which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began the final day of the match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match. Returning to play for Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and suffering from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets at an average of 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than two runs per over across five games.

It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.) Watching the shower of golden pine needles drift down from the redwoods whilst I typed out a blog post, I enjoyed seeing squirrels scamper and birds twitter their way around the boughs and branches. That blur below? A local black squirrel who was foraging amongst the cooing tourists for snacks… About 20 minutes later his grinning face floated back into view, and he brandished his phone with images of his quick wander through the trails. Lynn Canyon Park officially opened to the public in 1912; there are several trails throughout the park to choose from for a leisurely hike including the popular Baden Powell Trail and there are also many breathtaking waterfalls and popular swimming holes which are perfect during the summer months.

The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether PersonX needs what is mentioned in the Tail before the Head or not. Here need is a precondition for PersonX to achieve the event.

The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Head: PersonX bakes bread<sep>Tail: Industrious","completion":"In this scenario, the head is \\"PersonX bakes bread\\" and the tail is \\"Industrious\\". The tail represents a characteristic or trait, not an object, action, or person. Therefore \\"Industrious\\" is not a precondition or necessity for \\"PersonX\\" to be able to bake bread. Even though being industrious - or hard-working - might enhance the quality or quantity of the baked bread, it's not a requirement.

Article: Warning: This post contains graphic content A demonstration billed as a march for \\"law and order\\" in the streets of Portland descended into chaos as rival political factions broke into bloody brawls downtown Saturday night. Members of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer and their black-clad adversaries, known as antifa, used bear spray, bare fists and batons to thrash each other outside Kelly's Olympian, a popular bar on Southwest Washington Street. The melee, which lasted more than a minute, ended when riot cops rushed in and fired pepper balls at the street fighters. The Portland Police Bureau reported seeing protest and counter-protest participants outfitted with hard knuckle gloves, knives and firearms earlier in the evening. Police said they made no arrests Saturday night, but will continue to investigate. The wild scene unfolded amid mounting tensions among both groups, fueled in part by a pair of national news stories. A march in Portland against police brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's hands-off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver, which outraged many, including Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson and his supporters. On Friday, viral video surfaced showing members of the Proud Boys, a right-wing fraternal organization, beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at the Republican Party headquarters. It was against this backdrop that Gibson, who counts a number of Proud Boys among his ranks, organized the so-called \\"Flash march for Law and Order in PDX\\" — ostensibly to protest Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and his oversight of the city's police force. Waving American flags and breaking into patriotic chants, Gibson and several dozen supporters set off to a street memorial for Patrick Kimmons, a 27-year-old black man shot and killed by police, an incident that prompted last week's march. As they arrived at the vigil on Southwest Fourth Avenue and Harvey Milk Street, they were met by a large group of counter-demonstrators chanting \\"Black Lives Matter.\\" The two sides exchanged taunts and threats as police stood by and warned against physical confrontation. About 20 minutes later, the violence erupted a few blocks away among a smaller group of the participants. Below is a detailed timeline of events from the evening.

Which farm didn't help stabilize the soil? Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades. Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years. Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Answer:","completion":"Pear farm didn't help stabilize the soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He tests this theory and examines the boundaries of authority and his friendships. A few years before, a student, John Stanton was committed to an insane asylum, reasons unknown to most everybody except the principal. One day he escapes, releasing everyone else from the asylums around. Maddox sees this defiance which is the start of his anarchy. Maddox wants to \\"help him\\" and understand him more so they start a correspondence and Stanton tells him what to do and how to do them. This is includes the erasing of student grades, posting posters/fliers, locking part of the student body in a room among other things. Maddox gets his friends involved and challenges authority and gets most of the school behind him, including an administrator for a while. He is so consumed with creating chaos and disorder that his friends start to see the destruction, but they have to save themselves, and him before he can take complete control over the school.","completion":"The last name of the person who is consumed with chaos and disorder is Maddox."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one. Question: How long did Jennifer probably spend at the beauty parlor? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact duration of Jennifer's visit to the beauty parlor. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the series of events: 1. Jennifer accompanied her mother to the salon. 2. She browsed through style books while her mother was getting her hair done. 3. Jennifer discussed the desired hairstyle with the stylist. 4. She experienced some confusion regarding the shampooing process. 5. The stylist completed Jennifer's haircut. Typically, a salon visit for a haircut may last anywhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on the complexity of the desired style and other factors like the place in the queue, the overall level of service, and potential wait times. Considering that Jennifer had to pick a hairstyle and experienced an awkward moment around the shampoo station, her visit might be on the longer side of those estimates. It is likely that she spent somewhere between 45 minutes to 1.5 hours at the beauty parlor. However, keep in mind that this estimation is based on assumptions and the actual time spent may vary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Martin Luther (10 November 1483 18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707 29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns. - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian. - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement. - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius. - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. - Joseph ( Hebrew , Yosef ; Greek : , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed . - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.

The private elementary school of St. Catherine of Sienna was closed in June 2012 . The private St. Catherine of Sienna elementary school closed in June 2012 . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing refers to expressing the same idea using different words and sentence structures without changing the meaning of the original statement. In this case, both sentences convey the same information—that St. Catherine of Sienna private elementary school closed down in June 2012. The first sentence begins with \\"The private elementary school of St. Catherine of Sienna\\" while the second sentence starts with \\"The private St. Catherine of Sienna elementary school.\\" These two phrases represent the same entity, which is the private elementary school named St. Catherine of Sienna. The latter part of both sentences is nearly identical, with both stating that the closure occurred in June 2012. Therefore, despite small differences in their structure, the two sentences essentially communicate the same message and can be considered paraphrases of each other. It is important to note that paraphrasing is a valuable tool in writing and communication, as it allows individuals to share the same information or idea in varied ways. This can be particularly helpful when it comes to clarifying statements, summarizing complex ideas, or reiterating points for emphasis. Moreover, paraphrasing encourages writers and speakers to fully understand the information they are presenting, as it requires them to distill the core message of the original statement and reframe that message using different language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (Dutch: ['pIm for'toeyn] ( listen); 19 February 1948 - 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and professor who formed his own party, Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002. Fortuyn was often regarded as controversial due to his outspoken views about multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam \\"a backward culture\\", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. On 6 May 2002, at age 54, Fortuyn was assassinated in Hilversum, North Holland, by Volkert van der Graaf. The attack took place in a parking lot outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview. This was nine days before the general election, for which he was running. The attacker was pursued by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's driver, and was arrested by the police shortly afterward, still in possession of a handgun. Months later, Van der Graaf confessed in court to the first notable political assassination in the Netherlands since 1672 (excluding World War II), and on 15 April 2003, he was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system. The assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. Various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn's murder and deeply affected Dutch politics and society. Politicians from all parties suspended campaigning. After consultation with LPF, the government decided not to postpone the elections. As Dutch law did not permit modifying the ballots, Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The LPF made an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives by winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). The LPF joined a cabinet with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, but conflicts in the rudderless LPF quickly collapsed the cabinet, forcing new elections. By the following year, the party had lost support, winning only eight seats in the 2003 elections. It won no seats in the 2006 elections, by which time the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, had emerged as a successor. During the last months of his life, Fortuyn had become closer to the Catholic Church. To the surprise of many commentators and Dutch TV hosts, Fortuyn insisted on Fr. Louis Berger, a parish priest from The Hague, accompanying him in some of his last TV appearances. According to the New York Times, Berger had become his \\"friend and confessor\\" during the last weeks of his life. Fortuyn was initially buried in Driehuis in the Netherlands. He was re-interred on 20 July 2002, at San Giorgio della Richinvelda, in the province of Pordenone in Italy, where he had owned a house.

Q:Information: - The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office . - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States. - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State. - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot.

Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie.

Question: Article: The financial crisis is reminding Americans of a lesson they first learned in childhood: Share and share alike. They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically in communities across the Washington region and the nation. On one street in Arlington, for example, neighbors are collecting their separate money for mulch and dividing it among themselves. Question: What is the text mainly about? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sharing in the financial crisis.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the text is mainly about \\"Sharing in the financial crisis.\\" It describes how Americans are resorting to sharing resources, swapping items, and helping one another during the financial crisis. Examples include increased membership in car-sharing services, shared commuting (vanpooling), public bike programs, and growth in how-to-swap websites. People are cutting back on spending by doing things themselves and turning to others for help instead of purchasing new items or services. This sharing mindset had diminished as society shifted from agricultural to industrial, but it's now seeing a resurgence during the financial crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound. - A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means.

During the wars waged in the Baltic by the Catholic German Teutonic Knights; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the Old Prussians (the current reference to the people known then simply as the \\"Prussians\\"), were conquered by the Germans. The Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the Latvian and Lithuanian Baltic peoples. The former German state of Prussia took its name from the Baltic Prussians, although it was led by Germans who had assimilated the Old Prussians; the old Prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century. The Slavic people of the Teutonic-controlled Baltic were assimilated into German culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of Slavic and German families, including amongst the Prussia's aristocracy known as the Junkers. Prussian military strategist Karl von Clausewitz is a famous German whose surname is of Slavic origin. Massive German settlement led to the assimilation of Baltic (Old Prussians) and Slavic (Wends) populations, who were exhausted by previous warfare. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the name of the group that waged war in the Baltic?","completion":"The group that waged war in the Baltic was called the Teutonic Knights.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. After completing the study, how does the author feel about the results? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost - not enough information - They believe they have unhealthy dietary habits - They believe there were no changes The answer to this question is:","completion":"The researchers believe that restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight loss. The participants ate about 1000 kilojoules (approximately 250 calories) less per day during the restricted night eating period compared to their normal eating pattern.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Context: Mitchell's fourth expedition was into Queensland in 1845-46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, this being the main thrust of the endeavour. On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree (Buree in Mitchell's journal) with a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). He struck the Darling River above Fort Bourke then continued to the Narran River, the Balonne, and the Culgoa. On 12 April 1846 he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St.George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. He then crossed a low watershed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846. Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa and discovered the Warrago River. Keeping north over the watershed, he traversed the Claude and Nogoa rivers, then reached the Belyando River, an upper reach of the Burdekin River. This had already been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington on 2 April 1845. Intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the Burdekin River, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp. He continued west, making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled north-west river. In honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it Victoria River. Having run out of time, he turned back towards the main party. It was here that Mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name. On the homeward journey he trekked along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847. Later that year, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aborigines. Question: Did anything interesting happen during his exploration? Answer:","completion":"Yes, sweetie, during his exploration, many interesting things happened. This man, Mr. Mitchell, went on a big, big journey to find a special river. He started his journey with a big group of friends, including a man named Mr. Kennedy. As they went along, they came across many rivers and found a beautiful area with lots of good land for farming and a hill that he named Mount Abundance. They traveled to a lot of places, discovering new rivers, but the most exciting thing happened when he found a river that no one else had found before. He thought he had found the river he was looking for and decided to name it Victoria River, after the queen. Isn't that sweet? During this journey, he also discovered a special type of grass, which now carries his name - can you imagine having a grass named after you? Sadly, they found out later that the river he thought was flowing northwest was actually flowing southwest and it was renamed to Barcoo River.

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work.

Question: Which of Sloane's family members does Ferris pretend has died? Movie plot title: Ferris Bueller's Day Off Movie plot: In suburban Chicago, high school senior Ferris Bueller fakes sickness to stay home. Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned. Borrowing Cameron's father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder against Cameron's instinct, Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane drive into Chicago to sightsee. Leaving the car with two parking attendants, who promptly joyride it unknowingly to them, the trio visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Wrigley Field. They then go to a French restaurant for lunch where Ferris poses as the \\"Sausage King of Chicago\\", Abe Froman, while narrowly avoiding his father, who is eating lunch at the restaurant. Meanwhile, after humiliatingly failing to find Ferris, Rooney visits the Bueller residence and fails to enter, being attacked by the family rotweiller as his car is towed. Jeannie, skipping class, returns home and discovers her brother's ruse, but encounters Rooney snooping. She kicks him and calls the police, who arrest her for false reporting after Rooney leaves. While at the station, Jeannie meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris.

Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Personality, emotion, and mood are characteristics that help define an individual's mental and emotional state, with each playing a distinct role in shaping an individual's overall psychological framework. These characteristics not only influence one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior but also interact with each other to create a unique personal profile. They offer a window into understanding the individual's psychological well-being and response patterns in various situations. Personality refers to the unique and enduring patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior that make up an individual's character. It encompasses a collection of traits that manifest themselves consistently across various situations and time. Personality is believed to have genetic and environmental influences and is considered relatively stable throughout one's lifetime. The study of personality contributes to the understanding of individual differences and highlights the diverse ways in which people perceive, experience, and interact with the world around them. Emotion, on the other hand, represents a complex psychological state that involves a subjective experience, physiological response, and expressive behavior. Emotions emerge as reactions to specific events, stimuli, or thoughts, serving essential functions such as guiding cognition and decision-making, aiding in survival, and facilitating social interaction. Emotions vary in their intensity, duration, and expression and can range from basic emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, to more complex emotional experiences like love, envy, and guilt. Emotions are often fleeting, and their manifestation depends on various factors, including one's personality, mood, and environment. Mood refers to the pervasive and sustained emotional state that influences an individual's perception of the world and general disposition. Unlike emotions that are usually short-lived and situation-specific, mood states can last for hours, days, or even longer. Moods impact a person's thoughts, feelings, and actions and can be positive, negative, or neutral. They are influenced by various factors such as genetics, brain chemistry, stress, and even external circumstances like weather and social interactions. Moods may vary from one person to another and may not necessarily be an accurate reflection of one's objective reality. In the context of the broader study of emotions in various disciplines, these three characteristics intertwine, providing a comprehensive understanding of a person's mental and emotional functioning. Recognizing and understanding the roles and connections between personality, emotion, and mood is crucial for the effective delivery and understanding of psychological interventions, self-awareness, and personal growth in various fields, including psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, and education. For instance, in psychiatry, evaluating the interplay between personality traits, emotions, and mood states can assist clinicians in diagnosing mental disorders, determining appropriate treatments, and predicting prognosis. In psychology, researchers investigate the underlying mechanisms behind these characteristics to better understand human behavior and mental processes. In neuroscience, studies of neural mechanisms associated with personality, emotion, and mood facilitate understanding of the brain's affective systems and cognitive processing. In education, educators seek insight into the role emotions play in students' learning experiences, enabling the development of more effective teaching methods and fostering student success. In conclusion, personality, emotion, and mood are crucial characteristics in understanding an individual's mental and emotional state. These features are interconnected, and their analysis across different disciplines contributes to a deeper comprehension of human behavior and thought processes. Ultimately, such an understanding aids healthcare professionals, scientists, and educators in designing interventions and strategies that enhance overall well-being and promote personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But some of the most critical passages, including Burgess' calling the sedan a 'dog,' were removed from the paper's online version. The Detroit News' auto critic said Thursday that he resigned because editors demanded that he delete sections of a scathing review of the Chrysler 200, a car promoted in a popular Super Bowl television ad starring rapper Eminem. Scott Burgess' original review made it into the newspaper's March 10 print edition.

He said he was told March 11 what to take out of the online version. \\"I regret not standing up and saying, 'no, we can't change this.' I felt I'm just as guilty letting it happen,\\" he said. \\"I kind of felt like a deer in the headlights. I didn't know what to do.\\" Wolman acknowledged that the newspaper changed the online version after a car dealer complained about it.

Zone defenses are common in international, college, and youth competition. In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001--2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration. The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses. Is it true that can u play zone defense in the nba?","completion":"Yes, it is true that you can play zone defense in the NBA. However, it is important to consider the following steps to comply with the NBA rules: Step 1: Know the history of the rule change Understand that zone defenses were prohibited in the NBA until the 2001-2002 season. Since then, teams have been allowed to use zone defenses, but there are restrictions in place to ensure fair play in the league. Step 2: Be aware of the defensive three-second violation rule To prevent teams from fully exploiting zone defenses, the NBA has implemented a defensive three-second violation rule. This rule states that a defensive player cannot stay in the lane (paint/key area) for more than three consecutive seconds without actively guarding an opponent. Step 3: Make strategic adjustments Considering the limitations brought by the defensive three-second violation rule, NBA teams must adjust their defensive strategies when using zone defenses. They must focus on quick rotations and communication to cover the key area without violating the three-second rule. Step 4: Look for successful examples Despite its limitations, some NBA teams like the Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle have successfully used zone defenses as part of their defensive strategy. By studying their approach, one can learn how to effectively use zone defense within the NBA rules. Step 5: Combine zone defense with other defensive strategies Teams should not solely rely on zone defense but use it as a part of their overall defensive strategy. Mixing it with other defensive schemes like man-to-man can create strategic variety and complexity, making it harder for opponents to score. In conclusion, while playing zone defense in the NBA is allowed, it comes with certain rules and restrictions. Teams must adapt and follow these rules to make the most of the zone defense within their overall defensive strategy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A couple of months ago I got a job as a bartender abroad in Brisbane. When I first started I was told by the manager that interviewed me that my hourly rate would be 25aud. However when my first paycheck arrived I realized I'd actually gotten around 20aud per hour. Keep in mind that the job I took was cash in hand (not taxed) so there was no contract or anything like that. I realize that working cash in hand makes me somewhat of an asshole in and of itself but since I'm here very short term I'm not in a position to say no to work. I went to the owner (who handles everyone's paychecks) and confronted him about it. He told me that everyone in fact gets 20aud in the beginning but when he sees that they can carry parts of the bar themselves he would raise the salary to 25aud per hour. I wasn't happy being lied to but accepted it and figured I'll just put the hours in until he bumps up the salary. Now for a while I've been able to work easily on my own, taking care of the bar without help. So I sent a message to my boss a couple of weeks back asking when the rate would go up. It was left ignored so I went to talk to him about it and he scoffs and says he's busy (he is not a very pleasant guy) . I later heard from a workmate that actually everyone gets paid 20 an hour and the owner has no intention of paying anyone 25.

How is \\"Call me as soon as you hear from him.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Call me as soon as you hear from him.\\" can be translated as \\"Zavolej mi, jakmile o něm uslyšíš.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Zavolej mi\\" (Call me) - The verb \\"zavolej\\" comes from \\"zavolat\\" (to call) and is conjugated in the second person singular imperative mood. \\"Mi\\" is a pronoun in the dative case, meaning \\"to me\\" or \\"for me,\\" to indicate that the action should be done for the benefit of the speaker. 2. \\"jakmile\\" (as soon as) - This is a conjunction that expresses a temporal dependency between two clauses and means \\"as soon as\\" or \\"the moment that\\" in English. It connects the imperative clause \\"Zavolej mi\\" with the upcoming dependent clause. 3. \\"o něm\\" (from him, about him) - This is a locative prepositional phrase, where \\"o\\" means \\"about\\" or \\"from\\" and \\"něm\\" is a pronoun that means \\"him\\" or \\"it\\" and stands for the person from whom the information is expected. The preposition \\"o\\" requires the pronoun to be in the locative case, which is why \\"něm\\" is used instead of \\"on\\" (he). 4. \\"uslyšíš\\" (you hear) - Lastly, this verb is formed from the infinitive \\"uslyšet\\" (to hear). It is conjugated in the second person singular of the present tense (you + hear). The subject of this clause is implicit because Czech often omits subject pronouns when they are clear from the verb conjugation. Putting it all together, the expression \\"Zavolej mi, jakmile o něm uslyšíš\\" closely mirrors the meaning and structure of \\"Call me as soon as you hear from him\\" in English. This translation should effectively communicate the same message to a Czech speaker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that?

Finding themselves out of place at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house's party, they visit the slovenly Delta Tau Chi house next door, where Kent is a \\"legacy\\" who cannot be rejected due to his brother having been a member. John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky welcomes them, and they meet other Deltas including biker Daniel Simpson \\"D-Day\\" Day, ladies' man Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald \\"Boon\\" Schoenstein, whose girlfriend Katy is constantly pressuring him to stop drinking with the Deltas and do something with his life. Larry and Kent are invited to pledge and given the fraternity names \\"Pinto\\" and \\"Flounder\\" respectively, by Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms. College Dean Vernon Wormer wants to remove the Deltas, who are already on probation, so he invokes his emergency authority and places the fraternity on \\"double-secret probation\\" due to various campus conduct violations and their abysmal academic standing. He directs the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard to find a way for him to remove the Deltas from campus. Various incidents, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse belonging to Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Douglas Neidermeyer, and an attempt by Otter to date Marmalard's girlfriend further increase the Dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas. Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk....

Write a question about the following article: There is a large exiled Cuban-American population living in the United States, especially in and around Miami, FL and Union City, NJ. Those who oppose the communist government are represented in part by the Cuban-American lobby, which supports the U.S. embargo against Cuba and presses the communist government for political change. Other Cuban-American groups, some of which are anti-Communist, advocate different policies, opposing the embargo and favoring more cultural and economic engagement. Most prominent of these groups are the Brigada Antonio Maceo, Alianza Martiana, Miami Coalition Against the Embargo of Cuba, Alianza de Trabajadores de la Comunidad Cubana, Cuban American Defense League and Rescate Cultural AfroCubano. The Cuban government accuses Miami-based exiles of organizing over 700 armed incursions against Cuba over the past 40 years such as machine-gun attacks on the Guitart Cayo Coco Hotel by Alpha 66 in 1994 and 1995. The Cuban government has long contended that some South Florida Spanish-language journalists are paid by the U.S. government. On September 8, 2006, it was revealed that at least ten South Florida journalists, veteran reporters and a freelancer including some associated with the El Nuevo Herald, received payments totaling thousands of dollars over several years from the U.S. government for programs on Radio Martí and TV Martí, broadcasts aimed at undermining the Cuban state. In November 2006, U.S. Congressional auditors accused the development agency USAID of failing properly to administer its program to promote democracy in Cuba. They said that USAID had channeled tens of millions of dollars through exile groups in Miami, which were sometimes wasteful or kept questionable accounts. The report said the organizations had sent items such as chocolate and cashmere jerseys to Cuba. Their report concluded that 30% of the exile groups who received USAID grants showed questionable expenditures.

The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city had more problems with carbon monoxide? Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. The answer is:","completion":"Berg city had more problems with carbon monoxide. The paragraph provided explains that gasoline-powered vehicles emit various harmful materials, including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Berg city uses gas-powered vehicles, while Hill city uses electric vehicles. The formation of nitrogen oxides occurs when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, which typically occurs in gas-powered vehicles. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, contributing to smog formation. Although the presence of catalytic converters in vehicles' exhaust systems helps convert these harmful materials into less harmful products, it does not eliminate the emissions completely. Since Berg city relies solely on gas-powered vehicles, it would inherently have more problems with carbon monoxide in comparison to Hill city, which uses electric vehicles. Electric vehicles do not use internal combustion engines, and as a result, they do not emit harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Instead, electric vehicles draw their power from batteries. This means that electric vehicles themselves do not contribute to air pollution and have a much smaller carbon footprint than gasoline-powered vehicles in daily use. Consequently, Hill city's choice of using electric vehicles would lead to fewer issues with carbon monoxide and other pollutants compared to Berg city."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He said the group's world view \\"had a negative effect on me,\\" and made him irritable and angry. \\"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said.

The 2010 Commonwealth Games were held in New Delhi, and their organization was marred by various controversies and allegations of corruption. As a result, the government appeared to be cautious and hesitant to support another major sporting event, particularly in the wake of negative public opinion and concerns about potential financial mismanagement. Furthermore, hosting large-scale sporting events typically require substantial financial investments, including the construction and renovation of sporting venues, infrastructure improvements, and ensuring adequate security measures. The allegations of corruption in the 2010 Commonwealth Games raised questions about the effective use of public funds and the government's ability to manage and oversee such a significant project. In summary, the Indian government's decision to turn down New Delhi's bid for the 2019 Asian Games was primarily driven by concerns related to allegations of corruption during the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, as well as potential financial mismanagement and risk factors.

When Jack Nowell was told by Stuart Lancaster and his medical staff he risked being exposed as a one-trick pony if he didn’t undergo surgery, the young Exeter Chief hardly had a leg to stand on. Following five years of playing with pain in his left knee because of a chronic condition developed as a teenager, things got so bad that muscle started to wither and opponents began to take note. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a new lease of life following surgery which has finally enabled him to deliver a pain-free performance on two legs instead of one. Exeter full-back Jack Nowell has undergone surgery on a knee injury that had been causing him problems. England coach Stuart Lancaster had warned Nowell that he could turn into a one-trick pony without treatment. ‘I’ve had a patellar tendinitis problem since I was 15,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It was a big problem but I just cracked on hoping it would go away. It never did. ‘Being a youngster you think no-one will notice but with the amount of analysis that goes on now it was only a matter of time before I was sussed out.

Which language is this?","completion":"The text \\"Je to většinou malárie?\\" is written in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. It is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages. Czech uses a Latin-based alphabet enriched with diacritical marks, such as the háček (ˇ) and the kroužek (°), to distinguish similar sounding letters and denote specific pronunciations. Czech grammar is characterized by a rich inflectional system, with nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, and verbs demonstrating various declension and conjugation paradigms. The Czech language has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and two numbers (singular and plural). In phonetics, Czech has a relatively large number of consonants (25) and a smaller number of vowels (10), and it is known for allowing complex consonant clusters, which can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of words. Apart from vocabulary and grammar, Czech also features a pitch accent system in which the position of tone can distinguish the meaning of words. The Czech language has a long and rich history, with the earliest written records dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries in the form of Old Church Slavonic texts, such as the Kiev Missal and the Gniezno Glosses. Czech literature and culture flourished particularly during the 14th to 16th centuries, with the emergence of important works such as the \\"Chronica Boemorum\\" by Cosmas of Prague, the \\"Bible of Kralice,\\" and the works of Jan Hus and Jan Amos Comenius. Nowadays, the Czech language is an official language of the Czech Republic and the European Union. It is also a minority language in some neighboring countries, such as Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, and it is spoken by Czech expatriate communities around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand this, let's break down the process and analyze the impacts: - An owl leaves his nest: The blight on trees could potentially reduce the number of suitable nesting places, making it harder for owls to find safe, secure locations to raise their young. - The owl flys out into the night: The availability of nesting places does not directly affect the owl's ability to fly at night, but it may negatively impact the presence of a suitable nesting environment. - The owl looks down at the ground: This step is not directly or indirectly affected by the blight on trees. - The owl’s keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark: This natural ability is not impacted by the availability of nesting sites. - The owl’s sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey: Similar to the owl's eyesight, its hearing ability is not affected by the blight on trees. - The owl swoops down: This action is also not directly or indirectly impacted by the blight on trees. - The owl catches a mouse in his talons: The availability of nesting places does not directly affect the owl's ability to catch prey. Thus, the blight on trees causes a decrease in nesting places for owls which can be considered as an indirect impact on the first step of the process. The rest of the steps are not impacted by the blight. The indirect impact on the first step could mean that the owls may have to search for alternative nesting sites, potentially leading to a more time-consuming and energy-intensive process for the owl, ultimately affecting its reproductive success and population growth. However, the actual hunting and feeding process stays unaffected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - OGLE - TR - 113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE - TR - 113 . In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) detected periodic dimming in the star 's light curve indicating a transiting , planetary - sized object . Since low - mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet , radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body . In 2004 , the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet . The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter . Since the planet 's inclination is known , the value is exact . It orbits the star ( OGLE - TR - 113 ) in an extremely close orbit , even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days . The radius of the planet is only 9 % larger than Jupiter 's , despite the heating effect by the star . Planets of its kind are sometimes called \`\` super-hot Jupiters '' . - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1800 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Exchange a glance with someone, and then look away. Do you realize that you have made a statement? Hold the glance for a second longer and you have made a different situation, there is a permissible time that you can hold a person's stare without being friendly, rude, or aggressive. If you are on a lift, what stare-time are you permitted? To answer this question, consider what you typically do. You very likely give other passengers a quick glance to size them up and to assure them that you mean no harm. Since being close to another person signals the possibility of interaction, you need to send out a signal telling others you want to be left alone. So you cut off eye contact----what sociologist Erving Goffiman calls \\"a dimming of the lights\\". You look down at the floor, at the indicator lights, anywhere but into another passenger's eyes. Should you break the rule against staring at a stranger on a lift, you will make the other person extremely uncomfortable, and you are likely to feel a bit strange yourself. If you hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, what are you telling another person? Much depends on the person and the situation. For instance, a man and a woman communicate interest in this manner. They stare at each other for about 3 seconds at a time, and then drop their eyes down for 3 seconds, before letting their eyes meet again. But if one man gives another man a 3-second-plus stare, he signals, \\"I know you\\", \\"I am interested in you\\" or \\"You look peculiar and I am curious about you\\".

Which entity is this text about? Anthony McPartlin, OBE (born 18 November 1975) and Declan Donnelly, OBE (born 25 September 1975), known collectively as Ant & Dec, are an English comedy TV presenting, television producing, acting and former music duo from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The duo met as actors on the children's television show Byker Grove, during which and in their subsequent pop career they were respectively known as PJ & Duncan - the names of the characters they played on the show. They have had a successful career as television presenters, presenting shows such as SMTV Live, CD:UK, Friends Ant & Dec got their first presenting job in 1994, while they were still releasing music under the alias of PJ & Duncan. They co-presented a Saturday-morning children's show entitled Gimme 5, which was broadcast on CITV. The show only lasted two series before being dropped from the airwaves. In 1995, the duo were once again offered a job on CBBC, this time presenting their own series, entitled The Ant & Dec Show. The series was broadcast from 1995 to 1997, and in 1996, Ant & Dec won two BAFTA Awards, one for 'Best Children's Show' and one for 'Best Sketch Comedy Show'. In 1997, a VHS release, entitled The Ant & Dec Show - Confidential, was made available in shops, and featured an hour of the best bits from three years of the programme, as well as specially recorded sketches and music videos. In 1998, the duo switched to Channel 4, presenting an early-evening children's show entitled Ant & Dec Unzipped. This show also won a BAFTA, but was dropped from the airwaves after just one series. ITV soon signed the duo in August 1998, and within weeks, were assigned to present ITV1's Saturday morning programmes SMTV Live and CD:UK, alongside old friend Cat Deeley. The duo presented the shows alongside Deeley for three years, becoming the most popular ITV Saturday morning show. The programme's success was the mix of games such as Eat My Goal, Wonkey Donkey and Challenge Ant, sketches such as \\"Dec Says\\" and the \\"Secret of My Success\\", and the chemistry between Ant, Dec and Cat. Two SMTV VHS releases, compiling the best bits from both shows, were released in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Ant & Dec also starred in the children's TV series Engie Benjy during their time on SMTV. Ant & Dec made their permanent departure from children's television in 2001 after trying out formats like Friends Like These for BBC One in 2000 and Slap Bang with Ant & Dec for ITV in 2001 (which was basically SMTV in the evening even playing Challenge Ant against adults). They have since said that the main reason they left SMTV was because the Pop Idol live finals were due to begin on Saturday nights on ITV in December 2001.

Article: The formula used for calculating vapor pressure given a change in the vapor pressure over time is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (named for physicists Rudolf Clausius and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron). This is the formula you'll use to solve the most common sorts of vapor pressure problems you'll find in physics and chemistry classes. The formula looks like this: ln(P1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/T2) - (1/T1)). In this formula, the variables refer to: ΔHvap: The enthalpy of vaporization of the liquid. This can usually be found in a table at the back of chemistry textbooks. R: The real gas constant, or 8.314 J/(K × Mol). T1: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is known (or the starting temperature.) T2: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is to be found (or the final temperature.) P1 and P2: The vapor pressures at the temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation looks tricky because it has so many different variables, but it's actually not very difficult when you have the right information. The most basic vapor pressure problems will give you two temperature values and a pressure value or two pressure values and a temperature value — once you have these, solving is a piece of cake. For example, let's say that we're told that we have a container full of liquid at 295 K whose vapor pressure is 1 atmosphere (atm). Our question is: What is the vapor pressure at 393 K? We have two temperature values and a pressure, so we can solve for the other pressure value with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Plugging in our variables, we get ln(1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/393) - (1/295)). Note that, for Clausius-Clapeyron equations, you must always use Kelvin temperature values. You can use any pressure values as long as they are the same for both P1 and P2. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation contains two constants: R and ΔHvap. R is always equal to 8.314 J/(K × Mol). ΔHvap (the enthalpy of vaporization), however, depends on the substance whose vapor pressure you are examining. As noted above, you can usually find the ΔHvap values for a huge variety of substances in the back of chemistry or physics textbooks, or else online (like, for instance, here.) In our example, let's say that our liquid is pure liquid water. If we look in a table of ΔHvap values, we can find that the ΔHvap is roughly 40.65 kJ/mol. Since our H value uses joules, rather than kilojoules, we can convert this to 40,650 J/mol. Plugging our constants in to our equation, we get ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295)). Once you have all of your variables in the equation plugged in except for the one you are solving for, proceed to solve the equation according to the rules of ordinary algebra. The only difficult part of solving our equation (ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295))) is dealing with the natural log (ln). To cancel out a natural log, simply use both sides of the equation as the exponent for the mathematical constant e. In other words, ln(x) = 2 → eln(x) = e2 → x = e2. Now, let's solve our equation: ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295)) ln(1/P2) = (4,889.34)(-0.00084) (1/P2) = e(-4.107) 1/P2 = 0.0165 P2 = 0.0165-1 = 60.76 atm.

Javier Pedro Saviola Fernandez (Spanish pronunciation: [xa'bjer 'pedro sa'bjola fer'nandes]; born 11 December 1981) is a retired Argentine professional footballer who played as a forward. Known for his speed, dribbling and ability to score from almost any attacking position on the field, he represented both Barcelona and Real Madrid and was named as the youngest player on Pele's FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. Due to his ancestry he also holds Spanish nationality since 2004, and he amassed La Liga totals of 196 games and 70 goals over the course of eight seasons; he started and finished his career at River Plate. An Argentine international for seven years, Saviola represented his country at the 2006 World Cup and the 2004 Copa America, where his team reached the final. On 26 June 2009, S.L. Benfica and Real Madrid agreed on a EUR5 million deal that would see Saviola play in Portugal for the next three years, with an option for one more; a EUR30 million clause was added. He scored his first goal for the club on a penalty in a friendly match against FC Sion and, on 16 July, netted twice to send his team into the Guadiana Trophy finals. On 22 October 2009, Saviola scored two goals for Benfica, guiding them to a 5-0 victory over Everton for the UEFA Europa League (he would also score in the club's 2-0 win in Liverpool in the second match), adding another brace four days later in a 6-1 routing of C.D. Nacional for the Primeira Liga. On 6 December 2009, Saviola scored through a chip shot against Academica de Coimbra in a 4-0 home win. On 20 December he netted the game's only goal as Benfica defeated rivals FC Porto at home; during the victorious campaign, he formed a deadly offensive partnership with Paraguayan Oscar Cardozo, with the pair combining for more than 50 goals overall. On 3 January 2010, after receiving the Portuguese Liga Player of the Month award, Saviola scored another winning goal against Nacional, again being the game's only scorer in an away defeat of Rio Ave FC, netting in the 46th minute. He netted his 19th goal overall in a 3-1 home triumph against F.C. Pacos de Ferreira on 7 March, and Benfica were eventually crowned league champions after a five-year wait. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he receive any awards?","completion":"Yes, Javier Pedro Saviola Fernandez did receive an award during his football career. As stated in the text above, he was honored with the Portuguese Liga Player of the Month award on 3rd January 2010. This award was given recognizing his performances in the Primeira Liga, the top professional football division of the Portuguese football league system, where Saviola was playing for S.L. Benfica at that time. However, it's worth noting that this individual accolade was not the only recognition he received throughout his career. For example, earlier in his career, he was recognized by Brazilian legend Pele, when he was included as the youngest player on Pele's FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. This prestigious list was created by Pele as a part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of FIFA, soccer's governing body worldwide. Moreover, Saviola's performances in 2009 for Benfica contributed heavily to the team's success. He scored crucial and winning goals in numerous matches, and formed a potent offensive partnership with Oscar Cardozo, with the pair combining for more than 50 goals in total. This greatly helped Benfica to end a five-year wait and get crowned as the league champions. So, this Argentinian forward, celebrated for his speed, dribbling skills, and scoring prowess, was indeed acknowledged for his remarkable skill and contributions to the sport. His inclusion in the FIFA 100 list, the Portuguese Liga Player of the Month award, and ultimately his role in helping Benfica win the national league championship are clear testaments to his successful career in professional football."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Samsung Shows Off Galaxy S4 Mini, Two Windows Tablets LONDON—Samsung Electronics Co. on Thursday showed off an array of new devices with wide appeal, including a cheaper version of its flagship smartphone and two new tablets, in its bid to gain more market share in the highly competitive mobile-devices market. The product launches come amid mounting concerns that sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S4 smartphone may not be as strong as estimated. Samsung's Galaxy S4 Mini phone is designed for emerging markets. Shares in Samsung, South Korea's biggest company by market capitalization, have fallen sharply over the past two weeks, wiping out more than 27 billion off its market value. The decline in its stock price is reminiscent of the fall in rival Apple Inc. shares earlier this year that was sparked by concerns over demand for its latest iPhone 5. Morgan Stanley earlier this month cut Samsung's forecast for Galaxy S4 shipments to 61 million units this year from 71 million, noting a recent decline in component orders for the phone indicates a \\"normal, not super,\\" global rollout. See a side-by-side comparison of some popular phones. Explore features and specifications of smartphones. The brokerage estimates 310 million smartphone shipments for 2013, compared with an estimated 213 million units shipped in 2012, according to Strategy Analytics. Samsung doesn't disclose sales targets for its smartphones or provide a breakdown of mobile-phone sales. On Thursday, Samsung touted the Galaxy S4 Mini, a stripped down version of its high-end flagship smartphone, in hopes it will grab more consumers especially in emerging markets. Samsung didn't disclose how much the Galaxy S4 Mini would cost or when it would be available. In May, Samsung said it had shipped more than 10 million Galaxy S4s since the smartphone hit markets in late April. The company hasn't provided sales-figure updates since then. Plus, visit the Gadget Wars stream for the latest on the cutthroat action between Apple, Amazon, Google, Nokia and others. As smartphone prices continue to decline amid stiff competition and as manufacturers roll out cheaper smartphones, some analysts said Samsung's ability to deliver a wide portfolio of products across various price points is its survival strategy. Unlike Apple, which has only one line of smartphones, Samsung has been introducing hand-held and mobile devices in various sizes. But it remains to be seen whether there will be demand for all of the Samsung products. At Thursday's event, held at a cavernous exhibition hall in London, executives rattled off statistics for a bewildering array of products—some new, some previously announced—ranging from phones and tablets to laptops and cameras. Samsung appeared to be touting phones for every niche: large ones, small ones, those with zoom lenses, another that is dust and water-resistant, even a pink phone. \\"It's an 'all things to all people' strategy, covering every possible product size and type possible to capture as many customers as possible,\\" says Mark Newman, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. While Samsung is the largest smartphone maker, it still trails Apple in tablets. Apple had a 39.6% share in tablets in the first quarter, with 19.5 million units shipped, while Samsung was No. 2 with a 17.9% share, according market-research firm IDC. Gaining market share with tablets running on Windows may be difficult as well, as Microsoft Corp.'s latest Windows 8 operating system has so far failed to make much headway. Last year, Samsung unveiled its ATIV line of Windows-based tablets but it hasn't yet received wide acceptance by consumers. On Thursday, Samsung refreshed the product line by launching a 10.1-inch device called ATIV Tab 3 that is billed as \\"the world's thinnest Windows 8 tablet\\" at 8.2 millimeters thick. It also launched a 13.3-inch tablet called ATIV Q that can run both Windows and Google Inc.'s Android software. Samsung's Mobile Chief J.K. Shin said in an interview in March that smartphones and tablets based on Microsoft's Windows operating system aren't selling very well, adding that there is a preference in the market for Android. Along with the tablets and smartphones, Samsung introduced an upgraded version of its Web-connected camera called the Galaxy NX that comes with an interchangeable lens. The company is betting on the convergence of smartphones and cameras to grab more market share in the digital-camera industry, which remains a weakness for the company.

What is the difference between judicial activism and judicial restraint?","completion":"To determine whether the two questions are the same, let's analyze the meanings of the terms and compare them. Step 1: Define the terms Judicial activism: A philosophy where judges interpret the Constitution and laws broadly, often resulting in decisions that expand individual rights and liberties. Judges following this philosophy might not hesitate to strike down or alter laws they believe to be unconstitutional or unjust. Judicial overreach: When the judiciary exceeds its authority or mandate by interfering in the functions of the other branches of government, for example, by making policy decisions that should be made by the legislative branch. Judicial restraint: The opposite of judicial activism. A philosophy where judges are more cautious about overruling legislative and executive decisions. Judges following this philosophy focus on precedent and tradition, and avoid making broad constitutional interpretations. Step 2: Evaluate the two questions 1. What is the difference between judicial activism and judicial overreach? This question asks for differences between two distinct concepts: the approach of broadly interpreting the Constitution and laws and going beyond the scope of the judiciary's authority. 2. What is the difference between judicial activism and judicial restraint? This question compares two different judicial philosophies: one that encourages broad interpretation (judicial activism) and another that values staying within the limits of existing precedents and traditions (judicial restraint). Step 3: Compare the questions The two questions differ, as they compare different sets of terms. The first question asks about the difference between judicial activism and overreach, whereas the second question focuses on the distinction between activism and restraint.

Identify the context and key elements from the first sentence: The first sentence is about a boy offering assistance to Drew, with Drew being unaware of why the boy is helping. The key elements here are the boy, Drew, and an offer of assistance. 2. Identify the context and key elements from the second sentence: The second sentence is about Drew falling off his horse due to Apache attacks. The key elements here are Drew, his horse, and the Apaches shooting at him. 3. Compare the elements and context of both sentences: The common element in both sentences is Drew. However, the context involving the boy offering assistance and Drew falling off his horse due to Apache attacks is different. 4.

In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht.

Here's a step-by-step justification of why \\"whiskers\\" is the answer aligned with human common sense: 1. Analyze the options: a. Purring: Purring is a sound cats make, not a physical feature that could cause tickling. b. Four paws: While cats do have paws, the paws themselves are not commonly associated with causing a tickling sensation. c. Four legs: Similar to paws, legs could in theory cause tickling, but they are not specifically associated with tickling. d. Two eyes: Eyes are not involved in tickling, so this option can be eliminated. e. Whiskers: Whiskers are long, thin, flexible hair-like structures on a cat's face that are sensitive to touch and could easily cause a tickling sensation. 2. Evaluate common associations: Whiskers are often associated with cats and commonly come into contact with humans when a cat approaches them, rubs against them, or snuggles close to their face. This interaction can lead to a tickling sensation due to the soft and sensitive nature of the whiskers. 3.

Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony.

As mentioned in the background information, Acromyrmex heyeri workers create more openings in the nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up to regulate the temperature for the colony, which occurs in the temperature range of 20-30°C. Since the temperature on the first day was only 10 degrees Centigrade, it is below the range where workers would actively modify the nest thatch for temperature regulation.

Step 2: Determine the weightage of 11th and 12th in NEET After examining the NEET syllabus and the exam pattern, I found that the weightage of topics from 11th and 12th standard varies. The NEET exam comprises Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (Botany + Zoology) subjects. The syllabus includes topics from both the 11th and 12th standards, thus covering important concepts from both grades. Step 3: Investigate whether 12th board marks are counted in NEET Upon further research, I found that the 12th board marks are not directly considered when calculating the NEET score. The NEET exam has its own marking scheme, and the students' performance in the test determines their ranking. However, 12th standard marks are important for eligibility criteria, as students must secure a minimum percentage in their boards to be eligible for the NEET exam. In conclusion, the first question asks about the weightage of 11th and 12th standard topics in the NEET exam, while the second question asks whether the students' 12th standard board marks are directly considered in the NEET score. These two questions are not the same, as one refers to the importance of concepts from these classes in the exam content, while the other asks about the direct influence of board marks on the final NEET score."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The review highlights some aspects that might be seen as negative, such as the conversion of the original novel \\"Moon Lantern\\" into a film \\"Flight to Bogota\\" that has nothing to do with the original. It also mentions the disastrous casting of lead actor Michael Baytes and the problems created by too many people trying to take control. 2.

The film has been saved by its producer, Bobby Myers, and Sandy Ryan, who transformed parts of the film into a cohesive movie. 3. The reviewer labeled the filming process as \\"hilarious\\" and stated that the acting was good, generally. These are positive assessments, indicating that there were enjoyable and well-executed elements to the film. 4. The author did not mention any severe criticisms, and the overall tone does not seem overly harsh or disappointed. 5. The focus in the review is more on the storyline and characters rather than on negative aspects of the production.

Kevin Hughes, a 58-year-old patient, is one of many individuals impacted by this decision. Body: Kevin Hughes, who participated in a pre-chemotherapy trial for Aberiterone, credits the drug for extending his life. The treatment is typically administered to men when they are running out of options, following chemotherapy. Doctors suggest that thousands of patients could benefit from taking the pill earlier in their treatment journey, potentially leading to improved outcomes and longer survival rates. However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the body responsible for rationing the UK's healthcare budget, has decided against approving the use of Aberiterone on the NHS. The high cost of the drug is a major factor influencing this decision. Conclusion: As a result of Nice's refusal to approve Aberiterone for use on the NHS, thousands of individuals like Kevin Hughes may be denied the chance to access this life-extending treatment.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the name of the person that created the Oviri ceramic? Answer the above question based on the context below: Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

Article: As soon as you meet, or even see, a person, you form an impression of him based on his posture, gesture and facial expressions. This is why it is important to make a good first impression on the person who will be interviewing you. Within the first 60 seconds of meeting you, the interviewer will have formed an impression about what type of person you are and what kind of employee you would become, and 55% of this will be based only on your body language. Here are some tips to make you that impression a good one. First of all, relax. Think positive thoughts and you are more likely to come across as a positive, confident person during the interview. Dress smartly, as your appearance is one of the first things an interviewer will notice you. Stand up straight, and walk in with your shoulders back and your head up. Try to avoid slowing down as you walk into the room because this suggests fear and uncertainty. Shake hands with the interviewer firmly. You should have a positive handshake and a warm smile. Open your coat or jacket as you sit down shows that you, too, are open. Posture is important. You should be sitting well back in your seat. Sit up straight and lean forward slightly, but not too much. Sitting at too much of an angel expresses discomfort and distrust. Two of the most common signals are crossing your arms and legs, so try to avoid them. Another important issue is eye contact. Looking someone in the eye shows confidence in yourself and trust in the other person. However, don't overdo it, as too much eye contact or starring will make the other person uncomfortable. Use more eye contact when listening than when talking, and when you look away, look down. Looking up at the ceiling will make you seem bored and rude.

Question: what do mucous membranes secrete? Would \\"The secreted mucus traps the pathogens in the body, preventing any further activities of diseases.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, your answer is correct but it could be expanded upon for clarity. Mucous membranes, which line various cavities in the body and surround internal organs, do secrete mucus. This mucus contains enzymes and antibodies that help protect the body from the onslaught of pathogens like bacteria and viruses. One of the vital functions of the mucus is to trap these pathogens, which then prevents them from penetrating further into your body and potentially causing infections or diseases. The sentence \\"The secreted mucus traps the pathogens in the body, preventing any further activities of diseases\\" gives a general idea of the protective role that the trapped pathogens in the mucus can play, however, the precise function of trapping pathogens is to prevent them from entering deeper tissue layers, in addition to preventing \\"further activities of diseases\\". Thus, an elaborated answer with the given context could be \\"The mucus secreted by mucous membranes plays a protective role by trapping pathogens, preventing them from penetrating deeper into the body tissue and mitigating the potential for further disease activity.\\" This would render the answer more accurate in terms of the specific function of mucus in the body's immunity system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden. Question: \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" Answer: \\"The team was convinced by Bin Laden to attack warship instead of an oil tanker\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Plot title: Blazing Saddles Movie plot: In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad will soon be going through Rock Ridge, a frontier town inhabited exclusively by white people with the surname Johnson. The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to shoot the sheriff and harass the townspeople, the townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy. With his quick wits and the assistance of recovering alcoholic gunslinger Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception. He subdues and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking, but surprisingly philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, and Nazi soldiers. Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart gathers the townspeople and the black and Chinese railroad workersâwho have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the communityâto build a fake town as a diversion. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town; but with no people in it, Bart realizes it won't fool Lamarr's villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \\"William J. Le PÃ©tomane Memorial Thruway\\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \\"a shitload of dimes\\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town...

When you tidy your messy bedroom, it gets a lot easier to find things. Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain, helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas. To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't. Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night--in the course of your life, you'll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming. There's probably no single answer to the question why we dream, but there doesn't have to be.

The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A physical change involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points. Extensive properties depend on the amount of material and include mass and volume. The ratio of two extensive properties, mass and volume, is an important intensive property called density.

Article: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict. The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made \\"extraordinary progress\\" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years. However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. \\"As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics.\\" concludes the report. The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct. In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy. Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. \\"While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics...

Answer:","completion":"The most eastern point in the United States is West Quoddy Head, which is located in the state of Maine. West Quoddy Head extends into the Atlantic Ocean in the town of Lubec, which is part of Washington County. This location is well-known for its striking geographical features, such as rugged cliffs and crashing waves. These magnificent views draw many tourists and adventure-seekers to the area. West Quoddy Head is at a latitude of 44°48′45.3″ North and a longitude of 66°56′59.1″ West. This location makes it the easternmost point of land in the contiguous 48 states of the U.S., and it is known as the place where the sun first rises in the country. However, it is important to note that West Quoddy Head is not the easternmost point of the entire United States—that distinction goes to Point Udall in the U.S. Virgin Islands. One of the most notable landmarks at West Quoddy Head is the historic West Quoddy Head Light. This iconic lighthouse has been guiding mariners along the treacherous coastline of Maine since its construction in 1808. The current structure, which replaced an earlier wooden tower, was built in 1858 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980. Featuring a distinctive red-and-white striped design, the lighthouse remains a functioning navigational aid and a popular tourist attraction. Around the lighthouse, there is the West Quoddy Head State Park, which offers several hiking trails and breathtaking views of the surrounding area. Visitors can admire the rocky shoreline, look out across the waters to the Canadian coastline, or observe the diverse plant and animal life that call the park home. The park is also part of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current, which offers unique whale-watching opportunities in the summer months. In addition to its natural beauty, West Quoddy Head is adjacent to the border between the United States and Canada—specifically, it neighbors the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The close proximity between these two countries has led to a rich history of trade, fishing, and cultural exchange in the area, which continues to this day. In conclusion, West Quoddy Head in Maine is the easternmost point in the contiguous United States and offers breathtaking vistas, a historic lighthouse, and opportunities for outdoor activities. Considered one of the most stunning locations in the country, West Quoddy Head is an unforgettable destination that delights nature lovers, history buffs, and explorers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky... The answer is:","completion":"Ilya. Ilya Tchaikovsky, the composer's father, questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Since September, one person has left more than 54,000 worth of gratuity at restaurants around the country—crazy tips, like 1,000 on a 152 tab. Who is this good Samaritan? All we know is that he or she goes by tipsforjesus on Instagram. A few photos show people posing with their receipts. The tipster, who resides somewhere in in Southern California, is serious about making sure the tips get to the right person. About a week ago, a waiter from a restaurant in Notre Dame commented on a photo, claiming tipsforjesus’s 10,000 tip never went through. “Notre Dame is stiffing you?” tipsforjesus wrote. “Hmmm, let me make sure the charges went through since they claim they did not. If they're lying to you, I can talk to AMEX about it, then you should get a lawyer, and call the local paper and ESPN. What they're doing flys in the face of what Jesus would do.” Here are some others: H/T cnews | Photo by symic/Flickr ||||| Close Get email notifications on Christian Sheckler daily!

Their exploits are detailed on the TipsForJesus Instagram account, including many photos of the lucky servers posing with their signed receipts. Tips include several in Ann Arbor, Michigan (3,000 at Tio's Mexican Cafe, 2,000 at the Alley Bar), a few in Chicago (3,000 at the Boundary, 5,000 at Paris Club), and a whole bunch in Los Angles (1,000 at Fig & Olive, 10,000 at the Hungry Cat, 500 at Jumbo's Clown Room). TipsForJesus is also taking credit for a spree of big tips left at Ogden, Utah area restaurants back in August, although those receipts were not labeled TipsForJesus. It's unclear who is behind these tips, which the Daily Dot says amount to \\"more than 54,000\\" so far. It does seem to be possibly more than one person: the Instagram account uses the word \\"we\\" often, and before they recently switched to a TipsForJesus stamp for the receipts, the username was scrawled in more than one handwriting. TipsForJesus seems to be a college football fan, occasionally lining up with various football games (at Michigan and Notre Dame). A few also bear USC's slogan of \\"Fight On.\\" That last trip actually proved somewhat controversial, as the server at a Notre Dame-area bar commented on the Instagram that she did not receive her tip payment.

My question: Why did they enter the church? Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,\\" the Man (George O'Brien) and his Wife (Janet Gaynor) enter the church after a significant turning point in their relationship. As the story unfolds, the Man is tempted by the Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston) to kill his wife and run away with her to the city. However, while following through with the plan, the Man realizes he cannot go through with it and confesses to his wife what happened. His wife, frightened and upset, runs away from him and boards a trolley heading for the city. The Man follows his wife to the city, and they initially find themselves overwhelmed and lost in the city life. Over time, they rediscover their love for each other while spending time together and enjoying various city activities, eventually reconciling and starting to rebuild their relationship. As they continue to connect, they find themselves in front of a church, where a wedding ceremony is taking place. They enter the church and watch the ceremony, reflecting on their own vows and the deep love they have for each other. This serves as a reaffirmation of their commitment to each other and symbolizes their desire to start anew after the emotional turmoil they've experienced. The reason they enter the church, therefore, is to rekindle their love and receive a sense of hope, forgiveness, and renewal in their marriage, setting them on a more positive path moving forward in their lives together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: \\"Shinobi\\" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die. OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb. Fine, fine! There is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, NO! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, \\"Lalala, I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*.\\" THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the film, I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it. What is the sentiment of this review? Pick from: (1). negative (2). positive","completion":"The sentiment of this review is (1). negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the movie \\"Shinobi\\" due to the lack of character development, implausible reasons for the characters' deaths, and unimpressive action scenes. The reviewer criticizes the movie for not giving the audience a reason to care about the characters or their plights, and for not providing any anticipation for the fight scenes that were central to the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was entering my Sophomore year in High School, we had just moved from a single 4-way stop-sign town, to a bigger city with actual city buses! In order to get to school, I had to ride a city bus for the 1st time, without information/assistance! I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses! I noticed every time we went around a corner, it seemed a bell would ring. I falsely assumed it meant HANG ON! So, when it was time to return home, the bus was not as crowded, and I actually was able to sit down. Again, every time we turned the corner, a bell would ring. So I held on tight! As we neared my bus stop to get off, the bus whizzed past it, without stopping! Panic began to set in quickly. I already had a very strange, long day in a new 3 story school building, and I smelled like cigarette smoke! I quickly moved to the empty seat behind the driver, and told him he didn’t stop where I needed to get off. He asked me if I rang the bell. I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved! However, now I was 1/2 hour late getting home, especially stressed and tired from the new school and bus fiasco, AND I smelled like cigarette smoke! When I walked into my house, I was immediately confronted on why was I late, why did I smell like smoke, etc.!

Seamus didn't waste any time and quickly got up to search for his own meal. By that time, the rest of the guests had joined them. The room was filled with a mix of amicable banter and the clanking of cutlery against plates. Delightful aromas wafted in the air as the spread for the evening meal was revealed—one of Mrs. Elf's culinary masterpieces, no doubt. Paddy joined Seamus and helped him to navigate through the smorgasbord of dishes in front of them. Delectable delights like roasted root vegetables glazed with honey, steaming pot pies filled with tender meats, and pies topped with whipped cream piled high on the table. Seamus beamed with anticipation as he filled his plate with an assortment of these mouthwatering dishes. He made his way back to his chair eagerly, giving Mody a playful wink as he passed by. He then proceeded to take a hearty bite from his plate. \\"Ah, yes! Now that's more like it! This is definitely the meal for a weary traveler like myself,\\" Seamus proclaimed with a chuckle. The company shared a good laugh around the table, and the hearty meal was followed by captivating stories from each of the guests. From tales of adventure and bravery to emotional accounts of loss and renewal, the stories flowed like fine wine, leaving a warm and inspiring feeling in their listeners' hearts. As the night deepened, it seemed as though the fire in the hearth infused every room with its golden glow, casting playful flickers of light on the walls as the shadows shrank away.

He realized that this simple gathering, filled with laughter, warmth, and contentment, was what he needed most after his travels.

That night, Seamus dreamt of all the memories he had shared with his newfound friends at the table.

While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, \\"Goodbye\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland. The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics. In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting. The phrase \\"girl power\\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls' mantra. However, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \\"Wannabe\\", that the concept of \\"girl power\\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The phrase was regularly uttered by all five members--although most closely associated with Halliwell--and was often delivered with a peace sign. The slogan also featured on official Spice Girls merchandise and on some of the outfits the group members wore. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females. In all, the focused, consistent presentation of \\"girl power\\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism--popularized as \\"girl power\\"--in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. On the other hand, some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary. In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \\"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\\" The Spice Girls' debut single \\"Wannabe\\" has been hailed as an \\"iconic girl power anthem\\". In 2016, the United Nations' Global Goals \\"#WhatIReallyReallyWant\\" campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video for \\"Wannabe\\" to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian \\"viral sensation\\" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, \\"How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?\\" At the 43rd People's Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively dedicated her \\"Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress\\" award to \\"girl power\\" in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: \\"What was so neat about them was that they're all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.\\" At the height of \\"Spice mania\\", the group were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon. They advertised for an unprecedented number of brands, becoming the most merchandised group in music history, and were a frequent feature of the global press. According to Rolling Stone's David Sinclair, \\"So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.\\" This was even parodied in the video for their song \\"Spice Up Your Life\\", which depicts the group going around a futuristic dystopian city in a space ship surrounded by billboards and adverts featuring them. Throughout the American leg of their 1998 Spiceworld world tour, commercials were played on large concert screens before the shows and during intermissions. It was the first time advertising had been used in pop concerts and was met with mixed reactions in the music industry. Nevertheless, it opened up a whole new concert revenue stream, with music industry pundits predicting more acts would follow the Spice Girls' lead. In his analysis of the group's influence on 21st century popular culture two decades after their debut, John Mckie of the BBC noted that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, \\"the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band\\". The Guardian's Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the Spice Girls' true legacy: \\"[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since.\\" The mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success. The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi. Paul Gorman of Music Week said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s: \\"They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today. There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry, but the wider culture.\\" The Irish Independent's Tanya Sweeney agreed that \\"[t]he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls' naked ambitions\\", while Mckie predicted that, \\"[f]or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage, the scale of the Spice Girls' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated--at least not by a music act.\\" Answer this question \\"Did they continue to be involved in the band?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, they continued to be involved in the band.

He has previously served in multiple non-consecutive terms and in various other political capacities. In the passage, Putin is considering whether to declare his candidacy for re-election in the upcoming March elections, indicating his current role as the President. Vladimir Putin has been a significant figure in Russian politics since the late 1990s. His first term as president began in 2000, succeeding Boris Yeltsin, who had resigned in 1999. Putin was re-elected in 2004 for a second term, serving until 2008. At that time, the Russian constitution did not allow him to serve three consecutive terms, so he became the Prime Minister between 2008 to 2012 while Dmitry Medvedev held the office of the President. After the presidential term limits were extended to six years, Putin was elected president again in 2012 and re-elected in 2018. Throughout his leadership, Putin has made significant efforts in consolidating power, strengthening the economy, and asserting Russia's influence on the international stage. His policies and actions, such as the annexation of Crimea, military interventions in Ukraine and Syria, and alleged meddling in foreign elections, have often been met with both criticism and admiration, making him a controversial and polarizing figure in world politics. In conclusion, based on the information provided and his extensive history in Russian politics and government, we can confidently establish that Vladimir Putin is indeed the President of Russia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies, and have also made use of unorthodox time signatures. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy.

Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Did both the Airedale Terrier and Cão Fila de São Miguel originate from England? A:","completion":"To answer this complex question, we need to examine the origin and history of both the Airedale Terrier and the Cão Fila de São Miguel. 1. Airedale Terrier: The Airedale Terrier, often referred to as the \\"King of Terriers,\\" originated in England, more specifically in the Aire Valley region of Yorkshire. The breed was developed in the 19th century by working-class people who wanted a versatile, intelligent, and hardworking dog. The Airedale Terrier is a result of crossbreeding various terriers, such as the Old English Black and Tan Terrier, now extinct, with the Otterhound, which led to a dog that was skilled in hunting, guarding, and retrieving across land and water. In the beginning, it was called Waterside and Bingley Terrier, but its name changed to Airedale Terrier after the valley of the River Aire. Over the years, the Airedale Terrier has been used for various purposes, from hunting game to military and police work. The breed gained popularity in the early 20th century, both in England and the United States, mostly for its loyalty, courage, and versatility. 2. Cão Fila de São Miguel: The Cão Fila de São Miguel, also known as the Azores Cattle Dog or the São Miguel Cattle Dog, originated in the Azores, an archipelago belonging to Portugal. It is believed that the breed has been present on the island of São Miguel for over 500 years. The origins of the Cão Fila de São Miguel remain uncertain, but several theories suggest that the breed likely descends from dogs brought to the Azores by the early settlers, mainly from Portugal and Spain. These dogs would have been large, powerful, and skilled in cattle herding. Bloodlines of breeds such as the English Mastiff, the Portuguese Rafeiro do Alentejo, and the Spanish Perro de Toro could have contributed to the development of the Cão Fila de São Miguel. Used primarily as a cattle-herding dog, the Cão Fila de São Miguel has a natural guarding instinct and is known for its loyalty and protectiveness towards its owners. Over time, this breed has maintained a low profile and is not well-known outside the Azores. However, the Cão Fila de São Miguel has started gaining recognition, and efforts are being made to promote and protect this rare breed. In conclusion, the Airedale Terrier did, in fact, originate in England, while the Cão Fila de São Miguel hails from the island of São Miguel in the Azores archipelago owned by Portugal. Thus, both breeds did not originate from England. While the Airedale Terrier is a breed known for its versatility and courage, the Cão Fila de São Miguel is primarily recognized as a skilled cattle herder and loyal guardian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Genocide has become an official term used in international relations. The word genocide was not in use before 1944. Before this, in 1941, Winston Churchill described the mass killing of Russian prisoners of war and civilians as \\"a crime without a name\\". In that year, a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin, described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide. The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- (meaning tribe or race) and caedere (the Latin word for to kill). The word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the etymological basis of the word \\"genocide?\\"","completion":"The etymological basis of the word \\"genocide\\" can be traced back to its formation by combining elements from two distinct languages: Greek and Latin. The term can be broken down into two components: \\"geno-\\" and \\"-cide.\\" The first component, \\"geno-,\\" comes from the Greek word \\"genos\\" (γένος), which denotes a tribe, race, or a group of people who share a common lineage. By employing this prefix, it emphasizes the collective nature of the crime, referring to an entire community or population represented by the group being targeted. The second component of the word, \\"-cide,\\" is derived from the Latin verb \\"caedere,\\" which means \\"to kill\\" or \\"to cut down.\\" This suffix has been employed in various English words involving the act of killing, such as \\"homicide\\" (killing of a human being) or \\"suicide\\" (killing of oneself). When combined, \\"geno-\\" and \\"-cide\\" create the term \\"genocide,\\" which essentially means the intentional killing or destruction of a particular racial, ethnic, or national group. Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer, coined the term in 1944 to describe the horrific acts carried out by the Nazis and, since then, it has been used widely in international relations and legal contexts to define and address mass atrocities and crimes against humanity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him. When he realizes the guard was right behind him, Oswald quickly makes his move. Oswald prevails in losing the guard by going inside a cage. However, he is met with more trouble when the cage contains a jaguar. The jaguar chases him into the stage where acrobats are doing a balancing act with a long pole.

Does the sentence \\"Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.\\" answer the question \\"Federalism combines what two types of government?\\"","completion":"The sentence provided, \\"Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established,\\" does not explicitly answer the question \\"Federalism combines what two types of government?\\" However, it does suggest the presence of two levels of government that are involved in the concept of federalism and mentions that these two levels operate in a relationship of parity. This indicates that federalism involves cooperation between these two levels of government, each having their own powers and responsibilities. To answer the question explicitly, we can discuss the concept of federalism and determine the two types of government that it combines. Federalism is a political system in which authority and powers are divided between a centralized government and individual, smaller political units such as states, provinces, or territories. These two levels of government are the central (also known as the federal or national) government and the constituent (also known as regional, state, or provincial) government. Federalism strikes a balance between the two and creates a system that enables them to work together to govern a nation. In a federal system, the central government is responsible for the matters that concern the entire nation and require the coordination and uniformity that only it can provide. These responsibilities usually include foreign policy, national defense, the economy, the establishment of national laws, and other broader issues that affect the entire country. In contrast, the constituent governments have authority over matters that are more local in nature and pertain to the needs and interests of the specific communities or regions they cover (e.g., education, local infrastructure, public health, and law enforcement). The specific division of powers varies depending on the constitutional structure of the country, but the federal system is designed to ensure that no single level of government is given absolute authority over all aspects of governance. In the context of the United States, which was mentioned in the initial sentence, the Constitution of 1789 established the foundational principles of federalism by defining the division of powers between the Federal government and the state governments. This federalism structure has evolved over time, with different interpretations and changes in the specific allocation of responsibilities, but the core concept of the relationship between the two levels of government remains essential to the American political system. To summarize, the sentence provided implies the presence of two levels of government that are involved in federalism. To answer the question explicitly, federalism combines two types of governments: the central (national or federal) government and the constituent (regional, state, or provincial) government. These two levels of government operate in a relationship of parity and share responsibility for governing a nation based on a division of powers that allows them to address different scopes of issues, from national concerns to more localized matters."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given two natural language statements with similar wording.

If the wavelength is short, then the scattering will be long. Of all lights we can see, red has the longest wavelength. So the scattering is the weakest. That means the red light travels far. In fact, it travels farther on rainy days. Using the red light can help drivers in farther places see the lights. It helps drivers slow down or stop in time. So there will be fewer accidents. Moreover, red can also excite people. We can act more quickly when we see the color red. In a word, red lights help drivers stop in time and help prevent accidents.

To provide a comprehensive and detailed response, it is important to first identify the Act being referred to and the specific challenged section, before discussing the key individuals who authored or heavily contributed to that specific section. Assuming the Act mentioned is the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, it is vital to recognize which section of the MMPA faced the most legal challenges or controversies. Let's consider Section 101 on the \\"Moratorium on Taking and Importing Marine Mammals and Marine Mammal Products” as the most challenged section, given its significant implications on the regulation of marine mammal management. The Marine Mammal Protection Act is a federal legislation passed in 1972 to protect marine mammals, such as whales, seals, dolphins, and manatees, from decline or depletion as a result of human activities. One of the essential features of the MMPA is the imposition of a moratorium on the taking (harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing) and importing of marine mammals and their products. The given statement highlights two individuals associated with the Act – a lawyer who joined the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1972 and Dr. Gerard A. \\"Jerry\\" Bertrand, a marine biologist who transferred to a new White House office. Both individuals were instrumental in the creation and implementation of the MMPA. However, their names are not mentioned in the initial statement, so their specific contributions to the most challenged section of the Act cannot be established. To directly answer the question, it's essential to provide a clear and concise response about the authors or major contributors to the most challenged or controversial section of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Here's an example of a more suitable answer: The most challenged section of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972) is Section 101 on \\"the Moratorium on Taking and Importing Marine Mammals and Marine Mammal Products.\\" While it's challenging to pinpoint a single author for this section, significant contributors include a lawyer who joined NOAA in 1972 and Dr. Gerard A. \\"Jerry\\" Bertrand, a marine biologist, and Scientific Adviser to the U.S Army Corps of Engineers. Together, these individuals played a crucial role in drafting and shaping this critical and highly debated section of the Act.

Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. Question: What can we learn from Viry-Babel?

For instance, in the United States, the FBI reported that 15.6% of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were \\"because of a sexual-orientation bias\\". Under the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, as explained by Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, \\"workers or job applicants must not be treated less favourably because of their sexual orientation, their perceived sexual orientation or because they associate with someone of a particular sexual orientation\\". Under this law what does this state that is required by employers?","completion":"According to the text provided, the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 dictates several important requirements for employers. Firstly, the law corroborates that workers or job applicants must not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. This means an employer cannot refuse to hire, fire, or treat an employee unfavorably in terms of promotions, pay, job assignments, or any other term or condition of employment just because the worker identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or is perceived to be so. Secondly, discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation is also prohibited. This refers to situations where an employer discriminates against an individual because they believe the individual to be of a specific sexual orientation, whether that perception is accurate or not. Therefore, any bias or disadvantage in the workplace that results from an employer's assumptions or judgments about an employee's sexual orientation is illegal. Thirdly, the law protects individuals from discrimination based on their association with someone of a particular sexual orientation. This means employers cannot discriminate against employees because they are linked with people who identify as LGBTQ+. For instance, this covers scenarios where an employee might be discriminated against for having a child who identifies as LGBTQ+, or for advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, or for simply being friends with individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. Importantly, the law implies that employers must cultivate and maintain a working environment that respects diversity and is free from any form of discrimination, including on the grounds of sexual orientation. Employers may need to implement fairness and ethics policies, deliver diversity training, and handle complaints properly to ensure that the law is being followed and that all employees are treated with fairness and respect. In summary, under the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, employers are required to treat all employees and job applicants fairly and without discrimination, regardless of their sexual orientation, their perceived sexual orientation, or their association with someone of a particular sexual orientation. Violating these laws could potentially lead to legal repercussions for the employer."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was replaced by Jon Coghill? from the following article ?

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer.

Question: What is something that happens when you are learning about science? Options: A. testing B. experiment C. sense of wonder D. intimidation E. increased knowledge Answer:","completion":"While all of the options provided can happen when you are learning about science, the answer that is most in line with common sense is E. increased knowledge. When you learn about science, you are essentially gaining more information and understanding about the natural world and the underlying principles that govern it. This process enriches your knowledge and enables you to better comprehend and analyze various phenomena that you encounter in everyday life. Increased knowledge is a core component of the learning process, and it is through learning that one becomes more informed about any subject matter, including science. Option A, testing, is also generally associated with learning, especially in a classroom setting. Teachers use tests to evaluate your understanding of the subject matter and identify areas where you may need more help. However, it is the acquired knowledge that is tested, making E a more appropriate answer. Option B, the experiment, may be a method through which you learn and validate scientific concepts. Experiments are integral to the scientific process, allowing researchers to gather empirical data and test hypotheses. Though experiments are closely tied to scientific learning, they are not the only way to gain knowledge in this field. Option C, the sense of wonder, can be a strong motivation to learn about science. It refers to the awe and fascination people feel when exploring the mysteries of the universe and seeking answers to the questions that intrigue them. While the sense of wonder may be the driving force behind scientific curiosity, increased knowledge is still the primary outcome when learning about science. Option D, intimidation, might be felt by some learners when faced with a challenging subject or concept. However, this feeling does not automatically result from learning about science. Intimidation depends on various factors, such as personal background, learning environment, and prior experience in the field. In summary, while all these options may accompany the process of learning about science, increased knowledge (Option E) is the most in line with common sense, as it is the primary outcome and goal of education in any field, including science."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I remembered helping a lady with a lot of bags that day, so I went back to the store where I had dropped her off. It took me almost two days to look for her in order to return the ring. I didn't get as much as \\"Thank you.\\" Still, I felt good because I had done what was right. In all my years of driving a taxi car, I have never had any trouble with the public because I always try to be nice to everyone. I try to be honest toward others. I have been trying this for a long time, and the longer I try, the easier it gets. I believe honesty is one of the greatest gifts there is. It's something that makes a man a good guy. This is also my way to live by. Question: The writer came to New York _ .

I have two apple trees in the garden. Prana loved apples. When he went outside, he'd catch an apple and take it into the house to eat later. The apples had been on the ground and were often dirty so I wasn't always happy that Prana had brought them into the house. It was an autumn day in America, but it was very cold. A big snow fell and we had not done anything for its coming. On that special day, Prana went outside and I watched him through the window. I noticed that he was madly digging holes and bringing the apples to the ground so they could be seen above the snow. I did not know why he was doing this. He seemed to want to do something special. When I called him back, he had his usual one apple in his mouth. About five minutes later, I looked outside. The garden was completely covered with birds. Prana had dug up all those apples for his bird friends to eat. He knew that they wouldn't have stored enough food for the coming winter! Question: The topic of the story is about _ .

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Most of Bobby's free time is spent hanging out at a local diner during his lunch and dinner breaks to see his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black), who has dreams of singing country music.

However, given the options available, \\"being satisfied\\" can come closest to describing how they might feel. Upon seeing an idea become reality, a neutral individual might feel content observing the process and its fruition.

On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Redskins, the Panthers flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Monday Night fight with the Philadelphia Eagles. In the scrappy first quarter, Carolina struck first with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Eagles responded with QB Jeff Garcia completing an 8-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook. Fortunately, the Panthers would regain before the half with Delhomme completing a 1-yard TD pass to the back corner of the endzone, caught by WR Keyshawn Johnson. In the third quarter, Philadelphia struck back with Garcia completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Donte' Stallworth. Yet again, Carolina regained the lead with Delhomme completing a 35-yard TD screen pass to rookie RB DeAngelo Williams, who rushed well after a shaky first quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles crept closer with kicker David Akers getting a 28-yard field goal. The Panthers responded with kicker John Kasay getting a 45-yard field goal. Philadelphia would respond with Garcia completing a 40-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Brown. Then, things got grim when Delhomme got intercepted by Free Safety Brian Dawkins under pressure in the pocket, which led to Akers kicking a 25-yard field goal. Carolina tried to fight back as they marched deep into Philly territory, but came up short when Delhomme got intercepted again by cornerback Lito Sheppard in almost the same spot where Keyshawn Johnson made the earlier TD completion. Johnson claimed pass interference from Sheppard, but an official review decided this was not the case. With the loss, not only did the Panthers fall to 6-6, but it also marked the 5th time this season the Panthers had the lead going into the fourth quarter and lost.

Edgar Gordon, 49, was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Oak Hill, Florida on an outstanding arrest warrant issued by the Manchester Police Department for failing to register as a sex offender after a 39 day bike ride to Florida, police said. Gordon told police he left New Hampshire in May 2014 and stayed in the woods and various shelters until ending up at REANNA Ministries, where he was arrested.

(New Hampshire State Police via AP) AP Under New Hampshire law, he is considered a Tier III sex offender — the highest level and deemed most likely to re-offend — and required to register for life. Gordon was also wanted by New Hampshire State Probation and Parole for a parole violation, the Dunbarton Police Department for burglary and felony reckless conduct, and by the Merrimack County Sheriff's Office for failure to appear for burglary. \\"This is a great example of how the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Forces coordinate nationwide to locate sex offenders who no longer wish to comply with state sex offender registries,\\" U.S. Marshal David Cargill, Jr. said in a statement. \\"The cooperative effort of these fugitive task forces made up of Federal, State and Local partners allows the agency to locate sex offenders and fugitives who may be otherwise unnoticed in their communities throughout the United States.\\" Gordon is currently being held by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office on pending charges for failing to register as a sex offender in Florida, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said. Once cleared of any local charges, Gordon will be held as a fugitive from justice and will be extradited back to New Hampshire, officials said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short explanation of something longer, like a story or an article.

Jennifer's skates are much newer and more expensive than Natalie's because","completion":"Jennifer's skates are much newer and more expensive than Natalie's because Jennifer recently decided to invest in a premium pair of skates after realizing her passion and dedication for the sport. Since Jennifer is a competitive figure skater, she understands the importance of having the best quality equipment to support her in training and performances. On the other hand, Natalie is more of a recreational skater and primarily skates for enjoyment and leisure activities. Although Natalie does appreciate having a reasonably good pair of skates, the difference in requirements between the two skaters explains the disparity in the quality and cost of their skates. While shopping for her new skates, Jennifer focused on several key features that are important for a high-performance skater. For example, the blade quality and material are crucial, as top-quality blades made of stainless steel or carbon fiber provide better grip on the ice and are more resistant to corrosion and wear over time. Additionally, more experienced skaters like Jennifer benefit from a stiffer, more robust boot that offers increased ankle support and stronger control during intricate jumps, spins, and footwork sequences. This level of quality is often seen in expensive, professionally-designed skates. The brand and reputation of skate manufacturers also contribute to the higher cost of Jennifer's skates. Renowned brands such as Riedell, Jackson, and Edea invest in extensive research, technology, and innovation to create skates that cater specifically to the needs of elite figure skaters. These top-tier figure skate brands often collaborate with professional athletes to develop state-of-the-art designs that promise the highest levels of comfort, performance, and durability. In contrast, Natalie's skates may be purchased from a more budget-friendly brand since her skating activities are less demanding. Recreational skates may have lesser-quality blades and softer boots, which are more comfortable for beginner or casual skaters and come at a lower price point. While these skates still provide sufficient support for basic skating skills, they may not have the same long-lasting features and cutting-edge technology found in Jennifer's skates. Moreover, Jennifer's skates are newer, indicating that she may have replaced her old pair as she advanced in her sport and outgrew the capabilities of her previous skates. As a competitive skater continues to improve and develop, their skates need to keep up with their skill level and match their specific requirements on the ice. In Jennifer's case, investing in a high-quality, expensive pair of skates was a calculated decision to help her reach her maximum potential in figure skating. Natalie may still have her older pair due to the reduced wear and tear on her skates from her less frequent and less intense skating sessions. For her recreational purposes, there may be no pressing need to replace her current skates with a more expensive pair. In conclusion, the difference in the age and cost of Jennifer's and Natalie's skates can be attributed to their differing objectives and aspirations in the sport of figure skating. A dedicated, high-level athlete like Jennifer has more demanding equipment needs and is more likely to invest in newer, more expensive skates for better performance and longevity. In contrast, a skater like Natalie, who primarily enjoys ice skating for fun and leisure, might find that their needs are met with a less-expensive, older pair of skates that will suffice without breaking the bank."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 0 = 1930 * l + 30837 - 144707 First, let's combine the numbers: 0 = 1930 * l - 113870 Now, we want to find the value of 'l'. To do this, we need to move the number 113870 to the other side of the equation by adding it to both sides: 0 + 113870 = 1930 * l Which simplifies to: 113870 = 1930 * l Now, to find 'l', we have to divide both sides of the equation by 1930: 113870 / 1930 = l When you do the division, you'll find: l = 59 So, the solution for l is 59."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This was a great, if unconventional, love story with a beautiful setting. How often do you read of forty-year-olds and sixteen-year-olds falling in love and living happily ever after? The only problem I had with this book was that Belinda was a bit (well, a lot, actually) on the promiscuous side. Although it was a rather slow read (not because it wasn't exciting, but because the print is so small and the book is thick), it was always captivating. I liked this realistic book much more than Rice's vampire books. Personally I think she should stay away from vampires and so-called erotica and concentrate on things like this. Answer: 1). No; 2).

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Pumpkin king Jack Skellington (speaking voice Chris Sarandon, singing Danny Elfman), an elegantly attenuated skeleton, has delivered another scary Halloween. But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack's life and he's tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown. His people don't seem very impressed, so to draw them in, he makes some elements of Christmas -- including \\"Sandy Claws\\" (Edward Ivory) -- sound scary. Then he announces that they're taking over Christmas and starts assigning jobs. The evil scientist must whip up some reindeer, Halloweentown's top trick-or-treaters are to kidnap Sandy Claws, and Sally's task is to make Jack a red Santa suit. She tries to tell him that co-opting Christmas is a terrible idea, but he's too wrapped up in his enthusiasm to listen.The three trick-or-treaters return triumphantly with the Easter Bunny; Jack sends them back and eventually they bring him Sandy Claws (who surprises Jack by having hands rather than claws).

The text appears to be a quote from a song or a poem and conveys a sense of admiration and intrigue. The mention of \\"I love it!\\" further supports the notion that the sentiment is positive, as it expresses the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm. The tweet starts by seemingly criticizing the subject, describing them as \\"a nurse without a job\\" and \\"another uptown slob.\\" However, as the message progresses, the author questions their initial perception, with the phrase \\"but have I got you all wrong.\\" This implies that the author might be realizing that their initial judgment was incorrect or unfair, partly contributing to the positive turn in the sentiment. The phrase \\"one look and you weeerrrre gone\\" suggests that the subject of the tweet left an unforgettable impression on the author. The elongation of the word \\"were\\" adds emphasis and excitement to the statement. Such a statement generally signals a positive sentiment as it indicates the author's admiration, curiosity, or fascination with the subject, and it shows a change in perception. Overall, the tweet's sentiment leans more towards the positive side, considering the self-reflection on the initial judgment and enthusiasm expressed through the words \\"I love it!\\" and the alluring nature of the subject.

If you hold an incorrectly sized basketball, you may drop out. For beginners, picking out a short \\" bocce ball \\" is helpful.;","completion":"b). Smaller balls tend to be used by beginners and kids, while the larger ones are used by professionals. Regulation-sized bocce balls have a standard diameter of 107 mm (4.2 inches) and a standard weight of 920 g (~ 2 lbs).; Once you have gathered your bocce ball set and chosen the appropriate size for your skill level, you can proceed with the following steps to play the game: 1. Find a suitable playing area: Bocce can be played on a variety of surfaces, such as grass, sand, or a dedicated bocce court with a smooth, flat surface. The standard dimensions for a bocce court are 27.5 meters (90 feet) long and 4 meters (13 feet) wide, but you can adjust this to accommodate your available space. 2. Divide the players into two teams: Bocce can be played with 2-8 players, divided into two teams. Each team can have 1-4 players. If there are an odd number of players, one team can have an additional player who takes turns throwing the balls. 3. Determine the order of play: Flip a coin or use another method to decide which team will throw the pallino (the smaller ball) first. This team is called Team A, and the other team is called Team B. 4. Begin the game: A player from Team A throws the pallino into the playing area, ensuring it lands at least halfway down the court and not closer than 30 cm (about 12 inches) from the side boundaries or back end of the court. 5. Throw the bocce balls: A player from Team A throws one of their colored balls, attempting to get it as close as possible to the pallino. Then, a player from Team B throws one of their balls, also trying to get closer to the pallino than Team A's ball. 6. Alternate turns and keep score: The teams continue to alternate turns until all 8 balls have been thrown. Each team earns one point for every ball closer to the pallino than the closest ball of the opposing team. 7. Start the next round: The team that scored in the previous round gets to throw the pallino in the next round. If a round ended in a tie, the team that threw the pallino in the previous round throws it again. 8. Continue playing and declare a winner: The game continues with multiple rounds until one team reaches a predetermined number of points, typically 12 or 16. Throughout the game, there are a few additional rules to follow, such as no stepping over the foul line while throwing and balls that land out of bounds are removed from play. Additionally, if a ball hits the back wall without touching the pallino or another ball first, it is also considered out of bounds.

In a fiercely competitive match held at Exeter's home grounds, both Northampton Town and Exeter City fought valiantly but failed to break the goalless deadlock. The game saw a string of missed opportunities and superb goaltending on both sides, leading to a standstill that kept fans on the edge of their seats until the final whistle. As the first step to writing the article, it's important to introduce the key event - Northampton Town being crowned champions. The surprising element is the goalless draw that gives a twist to the expected triumphant victory. Even though Northampton Town was unable to score, their season-long hard work and commitment came to fruition as they were crowned League Two champions. The team's consistent performance throughout the season, resilient defense line, and fearless offensive strategies have been foundational to their success in this championship race. At this stage in the article, I am emphasizing on Northampton Town's championship win, highlighting their performance throughout the season that led to their ultimate success, regardless of the scoreless draw in the final match. On the other side of the field, Exeter City showcased their defensive prowess by successfully keeping the explosive Northampton Town's attack in check, leading to the goalless stalemate. Add an acknowledgement for the Exeter team reinforces them as worthy opponents and speaks on their strong defensive play during the match. Despite being the underdog in the contest, Exeter City's impressive resistance underpins their potential to be serious contenders in the next season's championship race. The goalless match against the champions demonstrated their ability to rise to challenging occasions and defy expectations. This point highlights the promising future of Exeter City, making the article balanced and not completely focusing on the champions. The goalless draw at Exeter did little to dampen Northampton Town's celebration. Even amidst the absence of traditional victory cheers, the team vividly celebrated their hard-earned championship, signaling a triumphant end to an exciting League Two season. Next, returning the focus to Northampton Town, it's important to reflect on the culmination of the season and their championship win. This unique championship win by Northampton Town despite a goalless draw fosters anticipation for the twists and turns of the upcoming season, igniting excitement in the fans of League Two football. Concluding the article by hinting at future possibilities helps bridge the gap between this season and the next while maintaining the reader's interest.

It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\" - Blooddrunk is the sixth album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, released on April 7, 2008, through Spinefarm Records. The album includes a re-recorded version single for \\"Tie My Rope\\". Various editions feature one or two cover songs as bonus tracks. The limited edition digipak version of the album includes a bonus DVD with 5.1 surround mixes of all songs and the video and making-of for \\"Blooddrunk\\". It sold 20,000 copies during its first week of release. - Viva La Bam is an American reality television series that starred Bam Margera and his friends and family. The show was a spin-off from MTV's \\"Jackass\\", in which Margera and most of the main cast had appeared. Each episode had a specific theme, mission, or challenge which was normally accomplished by performing pranks, skateboarding, and enlisting the help of friends, relations and experts. Although partly improvised, the show was supported by a greater degree of planning and organization. - Children of Bodom is a melodic death metal band from Espoo, Finland. Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). In total they have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD. - Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a subgenre death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" scene. - \`\` Tie My Rope '' is a 2007 song from the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom . The song is from Children of Bodom 's sixth studio album , Blooddrunk . The song was also included on Viva La Bands , Vol. 2 , a compilation album from the program Viva La Bam and the tracks on the album were selected by star Bam Margera . Musically , \`\` Tie My Rope '' bears a resemblance to songs from Children of Bodom 's album Are You Dead Yet ? , and was a product of the band 's exploration of their 1980s metal influences . In contrast to all of their past material , the keyboards have a much darker sound that blend in with the overall song . In addition , the overall usage of keyboards in the songs seem to be much more present than songs in Are You Dead Yet ? . The song was re-recorded for the actual album . - Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. Although Norway is known for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic death metal scene, while Stockholm is known for its more raw death metal scene. - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods.

Yinsen Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Infinite Rebirth\\" Genre: Action, Science-Fiction, Adventure, Drama Plot Overview: \\"Infinite Rebirth\\" follows the story of Yinsen, a brilliant scientist who helps Tony Stark build the arc reactor and escape captivity in a cave, and combines elements of action, sci-fi, adventure, and drama. Set in a world being torn apart by powerful corporations and their technological advancements, the film will explore the ethical consequences and broader implications of the revolutionary arc reactor technology. ACT I: The movie begins with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a genius inventor, and billionaire entrepreneur attending a global summit on renewable energy. As Stark presents his plans to build the arc reactor - a safe, clean, and virtually limitless energy source - he catches the attention of Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub), a world-renowned scientist from an unstable and war-torn region. Yinsen, impressed by Stark's ideas, sees the potential for the arc reactor to transform his homeland and save millions of lives. However, as Stark leaves the summit, he is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by a mysterious man known as Raza. ACT II: Stark awakens in a cave, his captors demanding that he builds a weapon using his arc reactor technology. Realizing that they might be in the same situation, Yinsen, who was also captured by Raza, quickly befriends Stark. Having already seen the potential of the arc reactor, Yinsen insists that Stark builds one for good instead of evil. Stark agrees, and together, they secretly work on building a miniature arc reactor to both keep Stark's heart functioning and power an armored suit they hope will help them escape. As they work together under increasing pressure, Stark and Yinsen share their personal stories and develop a deep friendship. Yinsen reveals his past as a scientist who invented various life-saving technologies, but which were seized by Raza and misused to instigate war and oppression in his homeland. He believes the arc reactor can offer people a bright future and be the key to ending the suffering caused by the conflict. ACT III: As Stark completes the armored suit, he and Yinsen prepare their escape plan, knowing that Raza will kill them once he realizes they didn't comply with his orders. Just as they are about to make their break, Raza discovers their secret and orders his men to attack them, resulting in a dramatic and intense battle. Stark, wearing the armored suit, uses the arc reactor's power to hold off their assailants, while Yinsen saves the reactor's blueprint onto a flash drive. In a harrowing sequence, Yinsen sacrifices his life so that Stark can escape the cave and return to civilization with the critical information on the arc reactor. Stark is eternally grateful for Yinsen's help and honors his memory by vowing to use the arc reactor technology responsibly, eventually becoming Iron Man. The movie concludes with Stark starting the \\"Yinsen Foundation\\" as a tribute to his friend's legacy, with the mission to provide safe, clean energy to countries in need. The final scene shows a city powered by an arc reactor, standing as a testament to the sacrifices of Yinsen and Stark's commitment to using technology for good. In \\"Infinite Rebirth,\\" the collaboration and friendship between Stark and Yinsen demonstrate that when individuals work together for the betterment of humanity, they can overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. The film serves as a reminder that although technology can be used for both good and evil, it's ultimately up to those who wield it to use it responsibly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. Navy handed over control of a seized oil freighter to Libyan forces while in international waters Saturday,. The saga of the North Korea-flagged tanker Morning Glory, which authorities now say is bound for the capital Tripoli, has illustrated the extreme weakness of Libya's government, vying with rebels for dominance since the 2011 ouster and death of Moammar Gadhafi. Officials also said that they had interrogated the captain and learned that it belonged to a Saudi company. Homecoming: North Korean-flagged tanker the Morning Glory, pictured here on March 8 docked at the Es Sider export terminal in Ras Lanuf, was returned to Libya Saturday by the U.S. Navy, which had seized it last week. Entourage: USS Elrod escorted the tanker on its way to Libya, with its 34 sailors staying about the Morning Glory. The main force behind the tanker is a well-known militia commander in east Libya who was planning to sell oil in defiance of Tripoli. But Ibrahim Jedran's international partners have until now remained unknown. North Korean officials say they have canceled the ship's registration after the incident. Last week, U.S. Navy SEALs seized the ship off the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, stopping an attempt by a Libyan militia to sell its shipload of crude in defiance of Tripoli. Under cover of darkness, the elite team of commandos swooped onto the The Morning Glory from a helicopter after tracking it down to a bolt hole some 18 miles southwest of the island nation. A Pentagon spokesman said they were met with next to no resistance as they swept silently through the vessel's corridors and cabins, arresting all inside. Nobody was injured in the operation. Jedran, whose fighters control the terminal where the tanker took on its load, is part of a movement demanding autonomy for the east of the country. He has warned the U.S. against handing over the tanker and three of his fighters, reportedly including one of his brothers, who are on board. Libyan authorities at first planned to. bring the tanker Morning Glory to dock at the port of Zawiya refinery,. 25 miles west of the capital Tripoli, according to Ayoub Qassem,. spokesman for the Libyan navy. However,. just as it came into sight of Zawiya, the country's top prosecutor. ordered that it head to Tripoli port for further investigation, Abdullah. Rashed, supervisor of operations at Zawiya port, told The Associated. Press. Rashid said the vessel would arrive late at night at Tripoli port and then continue on Sunday or Monday to Zawiya, though a navy spokesman declined to confirm this. Members of Libya's naval coastguard man speed boats as they wait for the arrival of the Morning Glory at Zawiya port, Libya. Qassem had earlier told the official news agency LANA that three Libyan navy ships escorted the vessel into national waters. Hours before the handover, at least 16 people were wounded when Libyan rebels occupying three eastern oil ports clashed with troops and attacked an army base, where pro-government forces had been preparing to break the rebel blockade. Anti-aircraft gunfire and explosions were heard overnight and after dawn on Saturday in Ajdabiya, the hometown of rebel leader Ibrahim Jedran, whose fighters seized the ports last summer to demand a greater share in Libya's oil resources. Last summer, Jedran's militia took over Libya's oil facilities in the east. As a result, the country's exports of its biggest revenue earner have slowed to a trickle. This month, the militia loaded the Morning Glory with 30million worth of oil. It set sail and evaded a Libyan blockade to escape to the Mediterranean, and the militia said they would sell the oil on behalf of a council that claims to be a government in the east, challenging the central authority. Qassem said three Libyans and 21 crew. members who were on board were detained by the Libyans after the U.S. Navy handed the ship over. A. Libyan security official confirmed that one of Jedran's brothers was on. board. He said a boat of the Libyan navy forces had taken the Libyans. and the crew aboard to Tripoli. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. A. spokesman for the guards of the oil terminals, Walid al-Tarhouni, said. Saturday that officials had learned that the ship belonged to a Saudi. company following interrogation of the vessel's captain, and after. reviewing the ownership documents. Change of plans: Just as the tanker came into sight of Zawiya (pictured), the country's top prosecutor ordered that it head to Tripoli port. Rogue militiamen: Rebels under commander Ibrahim Jedran unload ammunition from a boat at Es Sider port in Ras Lanuf; Jedran was planning to sell oil in defiance of Tripoli. Al-Tarhouni said Jedran's threats are ‘media talk’ that have no effect and that the army in the eastern area is working to regain control of the oil terminals. Jon Ki Chol, deputy director-general of North Korea's Maritime Administration, has previously said that although North Korea had provided a flag for the tanker Morning Glory, it canceled registration of the ship after being notified of the incident. When the ship docks into the harbor, it's expected to take 10 to 15 hours to unload 350,000 barrels of oil, Abdel Satar el-Terbel, coordinator of the naval operations in Zawiya Refinery Company, said. The attempted oil sale fueled political crisis in Libya and led to the parliament's removal of Ali Zidan from his post as prime minister, saying it had underlined his weakness. Libya's three rebel-held ports account for around 700,000 barrels per day of Libya's oil export capacity, or around half of its total petroleum shipments. Ransom: The vessel was stolen from the port of As Sidra last month by Libyan anti-Government insurgents, who are demanding a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy from the country's fledgling administration. They were tracked down near Cyprus.

The ship's captain was interrogated, and it was discovered that the vessel belonged to a Saudi company. The tanker had loaded 30 million worth of oil, which aimed to be sold on behalf of a council claiming to be a government in the east, challenging the existing central authority in Libya. The tanker, along with 21 crew members and three Libyans, were detained by Libyan forces after the handover by the U.S. Navy. This attempted oil sale further intensified the political crisis in Libya, which eventually led to the removal of Libya's prime minister, Ali Zidan. The three rebel-held ports in Libya account for roughly half of the country's total petroleum shipments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A Chinese actor's divorce from his wife has social media buzzing, with posts about the subject gaining over five billion views. WangBaoqiang announced online on Sunday that he was divorcing his wife, Ma Rong. He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. The topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce, and it seems Wang's predicament has struck a chord with many -- which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards. What exactly are they saying? Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like #WangDon'tCry# #WangWeSupportYou#, quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 87% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. Some have even published her home address online. \\"Wang is a hardworking man from a rural area. She cheated an honest man. I hate these kinds of people,\\"said one commenter on weibo. But why are they so interested? No other celebrity divorce or marriage has ever caused such a big stir on Chinese social media. On the surface, this might seem like just another Chinese celebrity split. But what is it about this one that's got all of China ruffled up? Some people feel that this divorce seems to fit a certain trope -- of a beautiful but ordinary girl marrying a rich but less good-looking man. It is not uncommon to hear the belief that a couple has to \\"match\\" at every level -- be it in status, or physical appearance -- for a relationship to work out. \\"The concept of being evenly matched is still one that is widely believed in China,\\" Dr Mu Zheng, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology at the National University of Singapore told the BBC's Yvette Tan. It's also making people talk about divorce. A lot of social media discussion has also centred around divorce, and in particular how people can protect themselves.

Background: Point of Grace is an all-female Contemporary Christian music vocal group. The trio consists of Shelley Breen, Denise Jones, and Leigh Cappillino. The group started out as a quartet in 1991, with original members Breen and Jones, as well as Terry Jones and Heather Payne. In November 2003, Terry Jones decided to spend more time with her family after giving birth to her third child, and left the group, with Cappillino joining in March 2004 for their 2004 release Context: After a hiatus, the girls regrouped in early 2001 to begin work on the follow-up to Steady On. They worked with six producers: Bannister, David Tyson, Nathan Nockels who played keyboards for them in the Steady On Tour, Tom Laune, Glenn Garrett, and Wayne Tester. Each producer brought a different sound, which is what they were aiming for when they started work on this project. The lead single, \\"Blue Skies\\" was an instant radio hit, and soon went No. 1. The album, entitled Free to Fly was released on May 1, 2001, and that same week they opened the Dove Awards telecast. The girls promoted the album during the summer of 2001, performing at the major Christian festivals and doing their own concerts, while preparing for The Free To Fly Tour. There were rumors that the tour might be canceled due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, but Heather cleared this up, stating that, more than ever, people needed to hear the message of hope. In honor of the ones who lost their lives in the attacks. They closed each show with a cappella rendition of \\"America The Beautiful\\". In early 2002, Point of Grace began work on a new project. The Girls of Grace project slowly became a reality. They worked with the Tennessee Choral Academy, and female artists such as Rachael Lampa, Joy Williams, Out of Eden and Jaci Velasquez contributed to the project with their talents. Point of Grace previewed the Girls of Grace devotional book, workbook, journal and album during the 2002 GMA Week and premiered one of their songs from the project, \\"All I'll Ever Need\\", on the 2002 Dove Awards telecast. The girls continued performing concerts until the summer of 2002, when they took a few months off. Shelley and Heather gave birth to their first children in September, and in the same month, Terry gave birth to her third child. The Girls of Grace album was released on August 20, 2002, and the first conference took place in October in Lakeland, Florida. To start things up on Friday night, the girls would give a high-energy concert. On Saturday, there were many speakers, such as Susie Shellenberger of BRIO Magazine, Nancy Alcorn of Mercy Ministries of America. They addressed topics such as self-esteem, sex, family issues, friendships and relationships with God. There were also musical guests. On the first series of conferences, Joy Williams helped provide music. Out of Eden was there for the 2003 and 2004 conferences. The Katinas also played in a few select 2004 conferences while Jaime Jamgochian and M.O.C. provided music and worship in 2005 and 2006. In 2003, the commemorative album, 24 was released, featuring the group's 24 greatest hits--as well as a new song, \\"Day By Day\\". They also released their first DVD, entitled 7, which contained the videos to seven songs. In November 2003, they published a hardcover book titled Keep The Candle Burning: 24 Reflections From Our Favorite Songs.

Farmer, a handsome 26-year-old singer, seemed like a lock for the Idol crown. He had a strong audition, scoring points by bringing in his cute daughter, Cadence, and telling a compelling story of military service and receiving a life-threatening injury in Kuwait. For extra heartstrings, he claimed to host Ryan Seacrest that the medicine he was taking to heal the brain injury made him sterile, thus his daughter's birth was a miracle. He went even further, telling judges Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban that he was dedicating his audition to his friends in service. STORY: 'American Idol' Recap: Battle of the Sob Stories Fox News reports he now says that he will no longer compete on the show after it was discovered he completely made up the story about sustaining a brain injury in an IED explosion in Iraq. \\"It was ALL lies,\\" Farmer wrote in a statement to Guradianofvalor.com \\"I in fact HAVE lied since a younger age and had a problem with it. I am coming out and making a statement (even though I was instructed not to) because I DO want to come clean.\\" Farmer first denied making the claim at all, stating that Idol producers created the tall-tale through creative editing in his video package. He also said that the photos of himself in the military were stock photos that he did not provide. \\"I'm FIRM in the fact that I know I had talked about it over 6 hours of interviews that I discussed certain missions and stuff that we did on a day to day basis,\\" he stated on the website. \\"Then I mentioned to a producer in an interview that I had an accident while in country and remember 'waking up in Kuwait.' This is where this was all pieced together. I am sure you have watched the clip and can realize that it is chopped up.\\" However, fellow soldiers that served with Farmer took to another website, StolenValor.com, to call him out on his facts. The \\"brain injury\\" in question was not from combat, they said, but from an overdose of acne medication and alcohol, which is forbidden in the military. PHOTOS: 'American Idol' Season 12: Will It Work? “I was a sniper section leader attached to his company and lived in the same room with him until he was medevaced from Ramadi because he got drunk while he was taking Accutane,” wrote a soldier who claimed to be his roommate. “He was never involved in one single direct fire engagement, was never wounded, and made up this whole lie to try and make his story sound good to American Idol.\\" Although Farmer is denying claims that he was kicked out of the army and Iraq, he said he is now going to tell the truth from now on. \\"I was told to keep quiet and not talk to anyone, and I have decided that what’s best for me and my family is to come out and end the insanity,\\" Farmer wrote. \\"I indeed have many many things to work with and need to get a lot of help doing it. Again I apologize to everyone that I have come across and hurt or lied too.\\" Watch Farmer's entire audition below: Twitter: idol_worship Michele Amabile ||||| Anderson keeps his dark hair trimmed short on the sides, and on the day I visited him, he wore blue jeans and a black T‑shirt emblazoned with u.s. veteran. He comes across as steady and unexcitable, his thick eyebrows framing a calm gaze. Doug Sterner, who served as a combat engineer in Vietnam and mentored Anderson in imposter investigation, describes him as circumspect. “He has a levelheaded approach,” Sterner told me. “It’s not a game, you’re not a cop, and it’s not about bagging a phony. It’s about getting to the bottom of the facts.” Sterner first discovered military fakers by accident, after launching a website devoted to cataloging the recipients of the nation’s top valor awards (the Pentagon only recently began compiling a master list). So far, he says he has compiled names and battle narratives for some 270,000 award recipients—though, as he has discovered, plenty of people claim to have received awards who never did. Sorry, Sterner learned to say when someone complained that a family member was missing from his list. Dad’s not a war hero. He finds these cases depressing, a distraction from his work “preserving the lives of real heroes,” so when Anderson reached out with a question about military records several years ago, Sterner welcomed his interest in investigating fakers; today, Sterner frequently sends stolen-valor tips Anderson’s way. If a lead seems legit, like the one about the Special Operations soldier turned police trainer, Anderson will poke around online to learn more about the person and hopefully find a date of birth or, better yet, a Social Security number. With those, he can access military personnel records, which will show, at the very least, where and when a person served. Freedom of Information Act requests can yield more-detailed documents, like those included with discharge papers, which show war-zone duty and special awards and recognitions. Many records are stored at the National Personnel Records Center, in St. Louis, but not all. Some military branches now keep their own records, so the search process can take months. “I build the case just like I’m taking it to trial,” Anderson says. “If a jury wouldn’t look at it and decide that person’s guilty, I won’t post it.” For as long as soldiers have gone off to war, they’ve exaggerated and lied about it, in ways big and small. When George Washington established the U.S. military’s first badges of honor, in 1782, he understood that soldiers deserved recognition, but also that they couldn’t be trusted not to embellish their exploits: “Should any who are not entitled to these honors have the insolence to assume the badges of them they shall be severely punished,” he wrote. So it continues today. In this thank-you-for-your-service era of adulation for the military, some can’t resist the ego-stroking pull of handshakes and discounts. Others get a thrill out of putting one over on everyone else. Anderson likes to tell the story of William James Clark, whose case preceded his own investigations. In 2002, after a barge slammed into a bridge spanning the Arkansas River, killing 14 people, Clark showed up wearing an Army uniform, told authorities that he was a Special Forces captain just back from overseas, and for two days asserted that he was in charge of rescue and recovery efforts—despite the fact that he was a civilian and had never served a day. “He took over,” Anderson said, giggling and shaking his head, “because he was in uniform and they allowed him to.” |||||","completion":"The article recounts the story of American Idol season 12 participant Matthew Farmer who admitted that he fabricated his story about suffering from a traumatic war injury. Initially, Farmer seemed poised for success on the show due to his strong audition, the compelling story of his military service, and the dramatic tale of surviving a life-threatening injury in Kuwait. He told the host, Ryan Seacrest, that the medication he was taking after his brain injury caused him to become sterile, making his daughter's birth a miracle. However, Farmer's lie unraveled when it was revealed that his brain injury was not due to an IED explosion in Iraq, but from an overdose of acne medication and alcohol, which is prohibited in the military. This revelation came to light after servicemen who had served with Farmer expressed their objections to his falsehoods on the website StolenValor.com. Furthermore, they stated that Farmer had never been involved in any direct fire engagement or sustained any injuries. Upon realizing the extent of his deception, Farmer withdrew from the American Idol competition and issued a public apology, explaining that he had been lying since he was young and had made a decision to stop. Initially, Farmer blamed the American Idol producers for constructing his exaggerated story through selective editing and claimed the military photos were stock photos. Still, he eventually admitted to his lies, saying he intends to be truthful from now on. The second part of the article further explores the issue of military imposters, highlighted by Doug Sterner, a combat engineer in Vietnam and military faker investigator. He mentioned that people often exaggerate or lie about their military exploits for various reasons, such as ego-boosting public recognition or the thrill of deceiving others. Sterner, who devoted his work to cataloging the recipients of the nation's top valor awards, admitted that uncovering military fakers is somewhat depressing for him. However, he often collaborates with another investigator, Anderson, in uncovering these military impersonation cases. Anderson’s method is meticulous and involves extensive online research, including access to military personnel records, freedom of information requests for detailed documents, and multi-source verification, to ensure the case is solid before exposing anyone. The article emphasizes that such fabrications around military service are age-old phenomenons and can be deeply harmful and disrespectful to actual veterans and servicemen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother.

The screen got scratched when John was cleaning it with a cloth because the Available choices: (1). screen is smooth.; (2). cloth is smooth.;","completion":"Based on the context provided in the given sentence, it appears that the correct ending to the sentence would be the one that provides a plausible explanation as to why the screen got scratched while John was cleaning it with a cloth. Therefore, the appropriate completion of the sentence would be: The screen got scratched when John was cleaning it with a cloth because the cloth was not smooth. The reason behind choosing this ending is that if the screen or cloth was smooth, it would be less likely for the screen to get scratched during the cleaning process. A smooth surface is generally less abrasive, which means that it wouldn't cause damage to the screen when rubbed against it. However, if the cloth is not smooth, there is a higher chance of the screen getting scratched. This is because a cloth with an uneven or textured surface may carry small particles or debris that can act as an abrasive material when the cloth is moved across the screen's surface. These particles can rub against the screen, causing the scratch. Thus, an extended version of the sentence can be: The screen got scratched when John was cleaning it with a cloth because the cloth was not smooth, which created friction between the cloth's surface and the screen, causing abrasive particles to scratch the screen's surface. To avoid such situations, it is crucial to use a soft, lint-free, and non-abrasive cloth when cleaning delicate surfaces like screens. Additionally, cleaning solutions specifically designed for screens should also be used to prevent any damage to the surface. Investing in screen protectors can also mitigate the risk of scratching the screen during cleaning or regular use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

No Justification: Each of the two questions asks for different information. 1) The first question asks for the country where girls are seen in public without clothes. This demands knowledge of different societal norms, laws, and cultural practices related to nudity in public among various countries. 2) The second question asks for the best nude beach in the world and why it is considered the best. This implies a ranking of nude beaches based on factors such as safety, location, amenities, cleanliness, scenic beauty, and possibly patron reviews. Therefore, this question doesn't necessarily care about the laws and societal norms – it's focused on beach quality.

Title: This Works, Although Slowly Review: Admittedly, I had a very tough job. My late husband had caulked around a bathroom sink with indoor/outdoor caulk, not the bathroom sort. I wanted to repaint this bathroom and did not desire to try to paint over this caulk. It was spread liberally on the wall next to the sink.It took 3 days and 3 applications and a lot of elbow grease to get most of that nasty caulk out. I must tell you that if you have caulk on a wall this will remove it, no problem. However, it will also remove the paint underneath. Beware that if you use this on a wall you will have to repaint that spot (which I was going to do anyway, so I didn't care).This caulk was hard as concrete and it did soften it a lot. I doubt I could have gotten the caulk out without this product. My bottom line: I couldn't have done without it, I needed it, and it was worth every penny. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?","completion":"The product review conveys a positive sentiment.

The river begins as the Agra Oya , in the Horton Plains . The Central Plains have an annual rainfall of between 125 and 200 inches a year . The river is approximately 70 km ( 43 mi ) long and drains a basin of about 58,534 ha ( 226 square miles ) . The river flows through a traditional area of ancient villages and tea plantations . King Dutugemunu spent his youth here . The Kotmale Oya flows into the Mahaweli shortly at Pallegama . Tributaries of the Kotmale Oya include the Nanu Oya , the Pundal Oya , the Puna Oya , and the Dambagastalawa Oya . The river was dammed between 1979 and 1985 as part of a hydro - electric project within the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga scheme . The opening ceremony took place in August 1985 . Some 3,000 families had to be relocated top higher ground . The area has a history of geological instability . - The Bay of Bengal, the largest bay in the world, forms the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean. Roughly triangular, it is bordered mostly by India and Sri Lanka to the west, Bangladesh to the north, and Myanmar (Burma) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) to the east. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity, and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. - The Mahaweli River (Mahawaluka nadee, literally \\"Great Sandy River\\"; [\\"mahawali gangai\\"]), is a long river, ranking as the longest river in Sri Lanka. Its drainage basin is the largest in the country, and covers almost one-fifth of the total area of the island. The real creation of Mahaweli ganga starts at Polwathura(at Mahawila area), a remote village of Nuwara-Eliya District in bank Nawalapitiya of Kandy District by further joining of Hatton oya and Kotmale oya.The river reaches the Bay of Bengal on the southwestern side of Trincomalee Bay. The bay includes the first of a number submarine canyons, making Trincomalee one of the finest deep-sea harbors in the world. The river and its tributaries are dammed at several locations to allow irrigation in the dry zone, with almost of land irrigated. Production of hydroelectricity from six dams of the Mahaweli system supplies more than 40% of Sri Lanka's electricity needs. One of the many sources of the river is the Kotmale Oya. What is the relationship between 'kotmale oya' and 'sri lanka'?","completion":"The Kotmale Oya has a significant relationship with Sri Lanka in various aspects, including geographical, historical, cultural, and economic dimensions. Geographically, the Kotmale Oya, as the longest tributary of the Mahaweli River, plays an essential role in Sri Lanka's water system. It originates in the Horton Plains and covers a broad expanse of 58,534 hectares, passing through several ancient villages and tea plantations. As one of the major contributors to the Mahaweli River, it contributes to the largest drainage basin in Sri Lanka, which covers almost one-fifth of the country's total land area. Historically, the Kotmale Oya has been an integral part of Sri Lankan history and its people. King Dutugemunu, a notable historical figure in the country, spent his youth in the region surrounding the Kotmale Oya. The river also played a significant role in the development of ancient villages and settlements in the area, with communities relying on it for water supply and cultivation purposes. Culturally, the river has been at the heart of traditional Sri Lankan customs and practices. The local people have long depended on the Kotmale Oya for irrigating their crops, fishing, and other day-to-day activities. This close connection with the river has fostered a deep appreciation for water resources, as well as the need for effective water management among the Sri Lankan communities. Economically, the Kotmale Oya has contributed to Sri Lanka's energy sector and agricultural development through the Kotmale Dam, which was constructed between 1979 and 1985 as part of a hydro-electric project within the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga scheme. By tapping into the hydropower potential of the Kotmale Oya, the dam helps generate a significant portion of Sri Lanka's electricity, addressing the country's energy needs. The dam also plays an essential role in the country's irrigation and flood control, ensuring a reliable water supply for agricultural activities in the dry zone. In conclusion, the relationship between the Kotmale Oya and Sri Lanka is multifaceted, encompassing geographical, historical, cultural, and economic aspects. As a vital water resource, the Kotmale Oya has significantly contributed to the country's development and shaped the lives of the Sri Lankan people throughout the history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Whose opera, The Voyevoda, contained a piece that had been promised to the Russian Music Society? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1867, Rubinstein handed over the directorship of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, to be replaced by Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply \\"with complete frankness\\", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was \\"a fully fledged artist\\" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \\"precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you\\"....

Answer the following question: Information: - Hack and slash or hack and slay, abbreviated H&S or HnS, refers to a type of gameplay that emphasizes combat. The term \\"hack and slash\\" was originally used to describe a play style in tabletop role-playing games, carrying over from there to MUDs, MMORPGs, and role-playing video games. In console- and arcade-style video games, the usage specifically implies a focus on combat with hand-to-hand weapons as opposed to guns. The term is often written in hyphenated form and with the conjunction contracted, e.g. hack-and-slash, hack 'n' slay. - Redwood City is a city on the San Francisco Peninsula in Northern California's Bay Area, approximately south of San Francisco, and north of San Jose. Redwood City's history spans its earliest inhabitation by the Ohlone people to being a port for lumber and other goods. The county seat of San Mateo County, it is the home of several technology companies such as Box, Oracle, Evernote, Wealthfront, and Electronic Arts. At the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,815. The Port of Redwood City is the only deepwater port on San Francisco Bay south of San Francisco. Redwood City is the location of the San Mateo County Jail, for both women and men. The Malibu Grand Prix long time landmark was recently demolished along with the city's only Mini Golf, Go-Kart, Video Game Arcade, and Batting Cages. Malibu Grand Prix's previous location is currently the construction site of a new additional Jail and Inmate housing facility. The city has a motto \\"Climate Best By Government Test\\" which is a reference to it being one of the top German scouted scientific climates and the city was one of the locations mapped by them during their testing and data collection. The Hetch Hetchy water pipeline runs through Redwood City and supplies a vast majority of the surrounding area with low grain (+/ 3 grains) rated water. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture.

Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - Ensemble Studios was a video game developer initially established in 1995 as an independent company by Tony Goodman, Rick Goodman and John Boog-Scott, but was acquired by Microsoft in 2001 and operated as an internal studio until 2009, when it was officially disbanded. Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the \\"Age of Empires\\" game series, \\"Age of Mythology\\", and \\"Halo Wars\\". In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated 500 million. - Diablo II : Lord of Destruction is an expansion pack for the hack and slash action role - playing game Diablo II. Unlike the original Diablo ' s expansion pack , Diablo : Hellfire , it is a first - party expansion developed by Blizzard North . More than a standard expansion , Lord of Destruction not only added content in the form of two new character classes , new weapons and an addition of a fifth act , but also dramatically revamped the gameplay of the existing Diablo II for solo and especially multiplayer . - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Blizzard North was the Bay Area division of Blizzard Entertainment, known for its \\"Diablo\\" series.

These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\". - Age of Empires III is a real-time strategy video game developed by Microsoft Corporation's Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios.

Fact 2: Like a mushroom, it lacks chlorophyll and is nonphotosynthetic. Given the two facts above, mushrooms are nonphotosynthetic and cannot what? The answer is:","completion":"Given Fact 1 and Fact 2, mushrooms, being a type of fungi, are nonphotosynthetic and cannot perform the process of photosynthesis to produce their own food like plants can. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen, which serves as a primary source of energy for their growth and metabolic processes. Since mushrooms lack chlorophyll, which is the green pigment present in plants that plays a critical role in capturing light energy for photosynthesis, they are unable to produce their own food through this process. Instead, mushrooms and other fungi obtain their nutrients through other means, primarily by decomposing organic matter present in their environment, such as dead plant and animal material. Fungi secrete enzymes that break down complex organic compounds in their surroundings into simpler compounds, which can then be easily absorbed by the fungal cells, providing them the essential nutrients required for their growth and reproduction. This nutritional adaptation is known as saprophytism, and it is an essential ecological role that fungi play in recycling nutrients and maintaining the balance in various ecosystems. Some fungi also form mutualistic relationships with plants, such as mycorrhizal fungi, which form a symbiotic association with plant roots and assist in nutrient exchange. The fungi take up nutrients from the soil and provide them to the plant, while the plant supplies the fungi with carbohydrates and other organic compounds. In summary, given the two facts above, mushrooms are nonphotosynthetic and cannot perform the process of photosynthesis to produce their own food as plants can. Instead, they acquire nutrients through decomposing organic matter or mutualistic relationships with other organisms, contributing to nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. While the review does mention a few positive aspects, such as the book being engaging enough to keep the reader reading, the majority of the feedback is negative, which would likely dissuade a potential buyer. Firstly, the reviewer highlights that they did not enjoy the book, which is a strong statement that could negatively influence a prospective buyer's opinion. The fact that they found the book's subject matter uninteresting and the protagonist's choices frustrating could lead the reader to question whether they would find the book enjoyable as well. Secondly, the reviewer mentions that the book made them cry only \\"once,\\" which could be interpreted as the book lacking emotional depth or not being as impactful as the potential buyer might hope. This may decrease the likelihood of purchasing the book, as some readers might prefer emotionally compelling stories. Additionally, the reviewer questions the ethics of sharing the protagonist's diary and whether they would be comfortable with it if they were in the same situation. This could make potential buyers consider whether they should support the publication of such material, undermining the motive for purchasing the book. Lastly, the reviewer's overall recommendation is negative, as they explicitly state that they would not recommend the book to anyone except those who specifically enjoy reading about drug addicts' experiences. This straightforward and negative recommendation from the reviewer would likely be a deciding factor in decreasing the chances of buying the product. In summary, while there are a few positive aspects mentioned in the review, such as the engaging nature of the book, the overall negative feedback and the reviewer's reluctancy to recommend it would likely decrease the likelihood of a potential buyer purchasing the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick? , can you please find it? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick is Keiser. Reinhard Keiser was a German composer, born in 1674, and became the musical director at the Gänsemarkt opera house in Hamburg."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer this question: is a club a biscuit or a chocolate bar?","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine the properties of a club to determine whether it can be classified as a biscuit or a chocolate bar: Step 1: Understanding the Club A Club is a snack food product produced by several brands, including McVitie's and Jacob's, which consist of a biscuit base with various flavored fillings, and they are coated in chocolate. Step 2: Identifying the main characteristics of a biscuit and a chocolate bar A biscuit is typically a small baked good that can have a variety of textures, such as soft or crisp, and can contain additional ingredients such as dried fruit or nuts. A chocolate bar, on the other hand, is typically a solid confectionery made primarily from cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar, which may also include additional ingredients such as nuts, fruit, or caramel. Step 3: Comparing the properties of a Club to the characteristics of a biscuit and a chocolate bar A Club has a biscuit base, which aligns with the definition of a biscuit. However, the chocolate coating could suggest that it's also a chocolate bar. So, based on the properties of a Club and the characteristics of biscuits and chocolate bars, I would classify a Club as primarily a biscuit due to its biscuit base, but with elements of a chocolate bar, as it is coated in chocolate. In essence, it's a chocolate-coated biscuit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Write a title for this article: CERRETO, Italy — Think of an Italian summer and you think of azure seas, sun-splashed beaches, cool mountains cupping dark lakes and overheated crowds of tourists investigating every museum and ancient church. Things are different in Tuscany as well as in Umbria, where I live, for part of the year. Every local community, no matter how small, puts on its own summer festa, or festival. Some are based on religion: Each village has its own patron saint to celebrate with a day of services and parades followed by a night of feasting, dancing and, of course, fireworks. Then there are sagras, festivals dedicated to food. Each community chooses a specialty food and organizes its festivities around it. There is the sagra del cinghiale (feast of roast boar), the sagra dell'oca (goose), della lepre (hare), degli umbrichelli (fat local spaghetti), della castagna (chestnut) and della lumaca (snail). There's even a sagra dedicated to bombolone, a custard-filled doughnut. Last summer, I decided it was time to get out and party like an Italian. I wanted to see how much fun I could have without spending much money or fighting my way down the clogged autostrada to sweltering beaches in the annual rush al mare (to the sea). I started at Cerreto, the hamlet I see from my kitchen window. Cerreto has a single street, no shop, no church and a school that closed decades ago. But for seven nights every August, it stages its Sagra della Focaccia (bread) that brings together more than 7,000 visitors to eat, drink, dance and make merry. That would be a challenge for a large professional catering operation, never mind a community with a population of 200. My friend Bernardo Barberani stopped by the first night. He is a third-generation award-winning local winemaker. He was carrying a chilled bottle of his Orvieto Classico and poured some into my plastic cup. He said that when he was young, his mother never let him go to sagras, \\"because the hygiene was a bit lax — people cooked outdoors around open fires.\\" Now, Barberani said regulations have been tightened and sagras are safe places to eat. Like other Italian dishes that now fetch premium prices in Manhattan and L.A., focaccia was once the poorest food of the poorest people; it's just bread made with flour and water. It used to be baked on the hearth in the evening under the ashes of the dying fire. Traditionally, when half-cooked, the bread was split open and stuffed with leftovers before being put back into the fire to get gooey. The Sagra della Focaccia re-creates this by offering a variety of fillings. I tried the sausage with arugula (about 6). The sausage juices soaked into the bread, which my husband, Mike, and I washed down with a bottle of Barberani's wine (another 6). Mike had the caprese, but there were plenty of other choices, including tuna or Nutella. By now, cars were driving slowly up the hill to park in a field set aside for the purpose, and the piazza was filling. Any fears I'd had that we would feel out of place soon evaporated. Italians are brilliant at making everyone feel welcome, and the communal tables mean you can mingle or not as you choose. There were British and American accents to be heard too, belonging to local expats and others. Typically, festas and sagras are run by committees. Giacomo Bonaccorsi, the local geometra, a cross between an architect and a surveyor, is a stalwart of Cerreto's core group. Guided by Bonaccorsi, I stepped behind the scenes to watch. Women made the dough, forming circles the size of dinner plates that they passed on to be baked in one of six wood-burning ovens. Franco, the retired village postman, was melting in the heat as he baked focaccia after focaccia. Small boys collected the freshly baked bread and took it to old men in red hats who sliced and quartered the loaves. Young women, giggling in their white hairnets and latex gloves, stood around a huge square table. They snatched up the fresh bread and stuffed the triangles for girls to stack on paper trays and take out to the waiting line. Threading in and out, children in Focaccia festival T-shirts tossed rubbish into black trash bags, their squad marshaled by Big Steve, formerly of Morgan Stanley in New York and now a Cerreto resident. \\"There's nothing like this in the States. It's so community,\\" he said, swiping another crumpled paper plate into his sack. No one gets paid except with food and drinks. All the profits are plowed back into the festival, which is how organizers built the huge piazza and six wood-burning ovens. With the feeding of the 1,000 that evening well underway it was time for the evening's second half — music and dancing. There's a different band every night of the festival, all of them professional touring groups. The bands draw the crowds and are the biggest item in the budget — 1,000 to 3,500 a night for a lineup of saxophones, dueling guitars, accordion, drums and two or three female singers in skimpy sequins. And Italians can dance. Everyone from tiny tots to anziani (senior citizens) knows his or her cha-cha from his two-step, and many are truly expert. As soon as the night's group, Vitamin Dance, struck up in a blast of synthesizers, guitars and flashing lights, the older couples dashed onto the dance floor, the grandchildren jiggled around the edges and the teenagers slunk off to their own alternative-rock disco set up in a lower part of the piazza. We retreated home to watch the closing fireworks, a brilliant, banging display, from our terrace. For the next few weeks, I dragged Mike to every nearby festa and sagra. They were easy to find, inexpensive, welcoming and a lot of fun. Although few were on the scale of Cerreto's, some had twists such as the village that staged a festa Aug. 10 for the night of San Lorenzo, traditionally when you see shooting stars. The festa started at 10 p.m. when the village policeman turned off the street lights. Flaming torches lighted on the rough stone walls returned the village to the Middle Ages. Scientists from Perugia set up two powerful telescopes for everyone to try. We ended by eating free pasta and drinking red wine. By then, no one minded that the shooting stars had been conspicuously absent. Ferragosto, on Aug. 15, is the Italian midsummer, with festas everywhere on that day. My village of Civitella del Lago stages an annual dinner in the street outside the church (15 a head for three courses plus wine), followed by dancing to an accordion trio. Finally, everyone troops to the belvedere overlooking the valley to watch a truly spectacular fireworks display, better than I've seen in London and New York on New Year's Eve. Enrico Montoni, who has been organizing festas in Civitella for years, said: \\"People will only give money if they know there are going to be fireworks.\\" Italians understand that fireworks are a show that starts slowly and builds to a crescendo so loud that you can't tell where the noise starts and your body ends. As I watched the display, I found myself next to Tobias Oberer, originally from Switzerland but now living locally. We talked about France, where you can buy cheap, handsome properties but where the villages are deserted, the populace long decamped to the cities. \\"Then you come here and just look around you,\\" Tobias said, gesturing at the buzzing crowd on the belvedere. \\"These are living communities. Old, young, rich, poor, fat, thin, everyone is here together with no barriers. This is the heart and soul of Italy.\\"","completion":"Discovering Italy's Summer Festivals and Celebrations In this article, we get to explore the wonderful summer festivals and celebrations held in small towns and villages in Italy.

It was too hot too cook in the kitchen, so Mom decided we’d grill hot dogs & stuff outside. But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she’d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late. To this day, my Mom is miffed at some family members that we had to find out that way (she was pretty close to this sister so she feels someone should’ve called before it got on the news) but as for me, I will never forget that look on my Dad’s face. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the aunt drowned, how does dad feel?

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What piece did Bizet play the piano version of for a select audience?, using the article: As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic]..., what would be the answer ?

A: Choices: (i). 40 %; (ii). 60 %; (iii). 100%; (iv). 50%; A:","completion":"To determine how much unpolarized light a polarized filter blocks, we need to understand the properties of both unpolarized light and a polarizing filter. Step 1: Understand the properties of unpolarized light. Unpolarized light consists of light waves that vibrate in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Essentially, there is no specific direction of the electric field vector in unpolarized light. Step 2: Understand the properties of a polarizing filter. A polarizing filter is designed to only allow light waves with a certain orientation to pass through. It blocks other light waves that have different orientations. Specifically, it only allows light waves vibrating in one specific direction to pass through. Step 3: Determine how much light passes through the filter. When unpolarized light passes through a polarizing filter, half of the light waves are allowed to pass through, and the other half is blocked. This is because, on average, 50% of the light waves will have the correct orientation to pass through the filter, and 50% will not. Based on this information, we can now answer the question: How much unpolarized light does a polarized filter block? The answer is (iv). 50%."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The earliest origins of the sport date back to the Middle Ages in England, Scotland, France and the Netherlands. The game can be played on a grass field or a turf field as well as an indoor board surface. Each team plays with eleven players, including the goalie. Players use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic ball. The length of the stick depends on the player's individual height. Only one end of the stick is allowed to be used. Goalies often have a different kind of stick, however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts, a mouth guard and a jersey. Today, the game is played globally, with particular popularity throughout Western Europe, the Indian subcontinent, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States (such as Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Place items you don’t use often inside your cabinets or store them outside your kitchen if you’re short on space. Only store items you frequently use on the countertop. This makes it easier for you to work in your kitchen every day. For example, you might keep your microwave on the counter if you use it daily, but put away your toaster if you only use it once a week. If you’re short on cabinet space, place any decorative items you’d like to display in your kitchen in an out-of-the-way location, such as on top of your cabinets. Don’t clutter your cabinets and countertops with decorations. Designate which areas need to remain empty, such as your food prep area. Then, find a spot for items you use daily, such as your microwave, coffee pot, dish rack, and cutting board. Make sure you know where your power sockets are before you decide where to place your items. You’ll need to put your appliances in a place where they can be plugged in. This includes items like your stirring spoon, spatula, spaghetti server, and slotted spoon. Only place items you use often in your utensil jar. Store items you rarely use but want to keep in a utensil drawer. A large jar or canister works great for storing your utensils. As another option, you can use a clean vase. Keep only the knives you actually use, such as your chopping and paring knives. Let go of your extra knives and knife block, which can take up too much space on your countertop. If you have knives you use occasionally, store them in a drawer. Donate your unused knives and knife block. A tray gives you more space around your sink. Place your soap, dish sponge, and towel on the tray. Then, place your sink stopper and bottle scrubber below the shelf. You can find an over the sink shelf for your kitchen. Alternatively, get creative and use a cake stand as a shelf! It's normal for your oil or honey to drip, making your bottle sticky. This can gum up your cabinet or countertop and make your other items sticky! Place your oil on a small dish or tray that you can wash often. It's common to store un-refrigerated produce on your countertop. Keep your produce together by placing it in a stylish bowl or basket. Then, set it on the counter where you can easily access it. Put your fruit where you can easily grab them for a snack. If space is an issue, you might place your vegetables farther back on the counter until you need them to prepare your meals.","completion":"In order to maintain an organized and functional kitchen, it is crucial to store items appropriately and strategically. Prioritize placing frequently used items on countertops, while reserving cabinet or off-kitchen space for items used less often. It is important to designate certain areas for specific purposes, such as a food preparation area, and to arrange your appliances near power sockets for practicality. Careful consideration should be given to the storage of utensils, as only those regularly used should be kept in a utensil jar or canister for easy access, while others can be stored in a drawer. When it comes to knives, only keep those you use, such as chopping and paring knives, and donate unused knives and knife blocks to save countertop space. To further optimize your kitchen organization, use a tray to store items around your sink, including soap, dish sponges, and towels. Consider investing in an over-the-sink shelf or repurposing a cake stand as a shelf for added space. Frequent cleaning of surfaces and containers can help avoid messes from sticky substances, such as oil or honey, and using a small dish or tray under sticky bottles can prevent residue from accumulating. Storing produce in a stylish bowl or basket on the countertop can make it easily accessible and add visual appeal. Ensure that frequently consumed fruits are within easy reach, and if space is limited, move vegetables to the back of the counter until they are needed for meal preparation.

A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), a primate paleontologist who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the Petrox Explorer. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a corporate spy from a rival oil company. While being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying the beautiful and unconscious Dwan (Jessica Lange). After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when Dwan revives. When she does regain consciousness, Dwan states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded.

The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'Club 905' owned & run by Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker). Lead singer Dylan (Sean Cook) & guitar player Mike (Jason McKee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) & drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer. Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster. Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one... Produced & directed by Juan A. Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it. The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it. As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on. Then there's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious. The kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor. Director Mas does alright, the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. The gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles. Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. Since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. It's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad. With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently. The acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad. The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies.

Consider the example of the horse, shown in Figure below . The fossil record shows how the horse evolved. Q: Scientists who find and study fossils are called what? A: Possible answers: A. biologists. B. geologists. C. anthropologist. D. paleontologists. Answer:","completion":"D. paleontologists. Scientists who find and study fossils are called paleontologists. Paleontology is a branch of science that deals with the study of prehistoric life, particularly through the examination of plant and animal fossils. Fossils provide valuable insights into the past and serve as critical evidence to understand the evolutionary history of various organisms. By studying fossils, paleontologists can learn a great deal about the characteristics and features of extinct species, as well as how these species changed and evolved over time. This information is useful for constructing a timeline of the Earth's biological history and helps us understand how different species have adapted to changing environments. In the case of the horse mentioned in the paragraph, the fossil record provides a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary history of the horse. Through the study of various horse fossils, paleontologists have been able to observe changes in the horse's size, limb structure, and dentition (teeth) that occurred over millions of years. These changes reveal the process of adaptation and natural selection that took place as the horse evolved to better survive in its environment. This understanding of the horse's evolution contributes to our knowledge of the broader history of life on Earth. In summary, paleontologists play a crucial role in uncovering the past by finding and studying fossils. Their work helps us understand the evolutionary history of different species and sheds light on the complex and fascinating story of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Brave Feline Rescue: Missing Cat Found Under Floorboards in Derelict House After Fire Introduction: In a miraculous twist of fate, a missing cat has been rescued after being trapped under the floorboards of a derelict house that recently suffered a fire. The desperate situation seemed to have reached a bleak end for the distressed feline, until a daring rescue mission brought the furry friend back to the safety of its loving family. A Glimmer of Hope: In the days since the fire tore through a recently-abandoned house, the cat's owners had slowly lost faith of ever finding their beloved pet. Hope was dwindling as the hours passed, but their commitment to searching never waned. It was this determination that afforded them with another chance at a life with their once-missing companion. The Discovery: The cat's heartbroken family had already scoured the neighborhood far and wide but found nothing, until they overheard faint cries for help coming from the derelict house. With cautious optimism and fervor, they followed the sounds, which led them to a pile of debris where their beloved pet remained trapped beneath the floorboards. The family immediately leapt into action, removing wooden planks to reveal their cat, who had miraculously survived the traumatic ordeal. The Rescue Mission: Knowing that they would need the support of professionals to safely return their feline friend from its precarious position in the damaged house, the family reached out to the local fire department. Firefighters quickly arrived on scene, ready to assist with the delicate rescue operation. The team worked meticulously to free the trapped cat, removing debris and sections of the floor, even as the structure groaned under the stress of their movements. Against All Odds: Despite the hazardous conditions surrounding the rescue mission, the team of firefighters managed to extract the weakened feline from its unfortunate predicament. Emaciated and frightened, the cat endured four horrific days before finally being saved by the diligent efforts of its family and courageous rescuers. What seemed like an impossible situation had met its match in the unwavering love and bravery of those involved. A Happy Reunion: Elated, the family embraced their purring ball of fur, grateful to be reunited after the harrowing days that separated them. With tears of relief streaming down their faces, they hugged the firefighters, appreciative for their selfless dedication to saving a life. It was a heartwarming moment captured by bystanders, a testament to the enduring bond of love that exists between pets and their families. Conclusion: This story of hope and determination acts as a beacon for pet owners and first responders alike. The resilient spirit of those committed to the rescue shows us that even in the face of an unimaginable situation, love, compassion, and teamwork can conquer all obstacles.

Answer:","completion":"If cheaper coal prices occur, it would likely lead to the purchase and use of more coal for the energy production process. However, the amount of coal mixed with hot air in the boiler would still depend on the operational settings and efficiency of the system. The direct process of coal particles mixing with hot air will not be directly affected by the cheaper coal prices, as the immediate reaction and proportion of coal and air mixture remain the same. That said, the perturbation might have an indirect effect on the process. Cheaper coal prices could incentivize power plant operators to produce more energy, leading to increased coal consumption and, potentially, an increase in the rate at which the coal-air mixture is processed to meet higher demands for energy production.

Whoever beats Brazil wins the World Cup this summer. It’s that simple for me, for reasons I’ll explain in a moment, and Argentina and Portugal — with one massive caveat — are the two biggest challengers to the hosts. The caveat is whether Cristiano Ronaldo, the world’s best footballer, is fully fit and playing at his peak. If he is, and it’s a big if, then I think the Portuguese are capable of being the cat among the pigeons.Can you imagine a final that pits Ronaldo on one side against the world’s second-best player, Lionel Messi, on the other? It would be a fantasy showdown. I for one would absolutely love to see that happen. Influence: Cristiano Ronaldo could lead Portugal to World Cup glory in Brazil this summer. Crucial: With Ronaldo in their team, Portugal could go all the way to the final in Rio De Janeiro. Tough: Portugal have been drawn in group G alongside Germany, Ghana and the USA. If you think Cristiano has an enormous ego already, imagine what it would be like if he reached the World Cup final! As a big fan of his, as well as his friend, I relish the prospect of that spectacle. He’s a showman and this is the biggest show. People see his ego — and don’t get me wrong, Cristiano’s ego is gargantuan! — but that is his fuel. It’s his inspiration. He reads all the articles written comparing him with Messi. ‘How can they say Messi is better than me?’ he’ll ask. ‘I’ll prove that writer wrong.’ That’s his mindset. Driven. Self-obsessed in the most positive way. Always looking to improve. That’s why he has become what he is, through effort and determination. It didn’t all come naturally. He worked hard at technique and hitting the ball. He’s the hardest worker I’ve had the privilege to play alongside. He’s a great team-mate, a companionable man, always involved in the changing room. But when it’s time to work he’s passionate about what he does and his emotion comes out. Support: Hosts Brazil are among the favourites to be crowned world champions this summer. Heavyweights: Lionel Messi's Argentina team have been tipped to win the World Cup. Predictions: Rio Ferdinand is tipping Brazil to be victorious in the World Cup on home soil. People say he stole Gareth Bale’s thunder in the Champions League final. Eh? He took his shirt off. He’s got an unbelievable physique and his girlfriend is a supermodel, and someone’s criticising him for taking his shirt off? The exhibitionist is part of who he is. But away from the field of play he’s one of the nicest kids you could meet. He makes time for fans, he’ll sit around a table late into the night talking. He’s no lone wolf. He first came to our attention at Manchester United when we played Sporting Lisbon in 2003. By half-time he’d razzle-dazzled us and we were all in the dressing room asking: ‘Who the hell is this kid? We MUST sign him!’ And Sir Alex did. He arrived at Old Trafford with his tricks and his stepovers and his attitude. What a young showpony he was, wanting to look good, then be good, in that order. The wrong order. Fergie had a word or three over time, and so did Ronnie’s hugely influential compatriot, Carlos Queiroz, and we as team-mates let him know there needed to be an end product to his skills. Side by side: Rio Ferdinand and Ronaldo together in their Manchester United days. Upstaged? Cristiano Ronaldo took his shirt off after scoring a penalty in the Champions League final. Change: Ronaldo left Sporting Lisbon in 2003 to join Manchester United, where he became a star. To his enormous credit, the penny dropped, and he took it all on board and started on his journey to become the world’s best. There are players who maybe have more natural talent and the penny never drops for them. You will have guessed by now that I’m a fan of CR7’s work! I hope for him that he has a standout World Cup. With him on fire, Portugal can make huge waves. Without him, they’re half a team or less. With my pragmatist’s hat on, and fearing that seven games could be a few too far for Portugal if Ronaldo isn’t 100 per cent physically well, I believe we’ll see a Brazil-Argentina final. And I think that Brazil, inspired by the maverick genius of Neymar, will be triumphant on home soil.I see Brazil overcoming Germany (if not Portugal) in one semi-final, and Argentina beating Spain in the other. I think Holland might struggle to get out of Group B, that Spain should win, because Chile are a fine team, although Robin van Persie is a match-winner. Colombia and Ivory Coast should come through Group C and England’s group are dealt with elsewhere: Italy plus one, basically. France win Group E for me, and Argentina take F, with Germany and Portugal coming out of G and probably Belgium winning H. Pressure: Neymar is the poster boy of the World Cup and is expected to fire Brazil to glory. Tricky: 2010 finalists Spain and Netherlands have been drawn in the same group this time. Shining light: With Messi leading the line, Argentina have an number of attacking options. The Belgians should win their group, but they are a peculiar prospect in some ways. They could be the team everyone believes they are capable of being and reach the last eight or further. Or they could be the biggest burster of expectations because their youth and inexperience may tell at this level. Argentina have a strength in depth that means they could cope without Messi if they had to. It tells you something when a player of Carlos Tevez’s qualities didn’t even make the cut. Aside from Messi, they have Gonzalo Higuain, Sergio Aguero — the world’s best natural goalscorer in my book — as well as Angel Di Maria, one of the stars of the Champions League last season, and Ezequiel Lavezzi, and on and on. The one area of caution is defence, but it’s hardly shabby. As big an admirer of Spain as I have been in recent times, I do think this could be a tournament too far as age starts to tell. But they’ll still go far. But not as far as Brazil. The Confederations Cup victory last summer was a fillip that cannot be understated. They know now they can perform and win under that enormous home pressure. Sunning up: Juventus forward Carlos Tevez missed out on Argentina's World Cup squad. Dark horse: Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard will lead Belgium's quest at the World Cup. In Neymar they have a player who bucks a common trend of great performances for club and indifferent games for country. He pulls on his Brazil shirt and shines. He is Brazil’s go-to guy for inspiration, and backing him up he has a cast awash with talent and no small amount of toughness, exemplified by Fernandinho, who is a top player. Ramires is a great athlete, so too Willian. Oscar will score and Hulk is a danger. Brazil’s Achilles heel for me is a lack of a traditional No 9 but they have enough elsewhere to compensate.

Although Lily gets her big break when the star quits, she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show. 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truely wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The standout supporting performance though goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, a one time actress turned theater custodian. Worth a watch for sure.

Article:Scientists from Australia, France and Japan checked out a 5,000km stretch of coastline in East Antarctica. It was thought there were about 2.3 million penguins in the area but now after counting again scientists say it is 5.9 million. Using this new figure they estimate there are between 14 and 16 million of these birds around the world! Scientists say the reason they got it wrong the first time was because they didn't look at non-breeding penguins that were out getting food. Australian Antarctic Division seabird ecologist, Dr Louise Emmerson said \\"Non-breeding birds are harder to count because they are out foraging at sea, rather than nesting in colonies on land.\\" The birds are hard to count because they travel a long way and spend a lot of time catching food. And they need a lot of food for their chicks. An estimated 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish are eaten during the breeding season by Adélie penguins breeding in East Antarctica.\\" Dr Emmerson said.

News article: A JANUARY GUIDE TO GALLERY HOPPING 57TH STREET BIRTHDAYS should be fun, and double birthdays doubly so. It so happens that both the Grace Borgenicht Gallery, now at 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, and the Terry Dintenfass Gallery, now at 50 West 57th Street, this year celebrate their 20th anniversaries. What better plan, they thought, than to mark the occasion jointly, by showing work by artists who had been with them throughout the 20 years of their existence? From there, the project ballooned. What if the figure 20 were accorded a decisive role, and not two but 20 galleries in all were to contribute to the birthday celebration at Borgenicht and Dintenfass? The criterion for admission would remain the same, and the shows would constitute an honor roll of mutual fidelity. The galleries in question represent almost every known tendency in art, and some of them have long passed the 20 years' minimum age. The Graham Gallery dates from 1857, for instance, the Kraushaar Gallery from 1885, the Pierre Matisse Gallery from 1931, the Midtown Gallery from 1931-32, the Willard Gallery from 1940, the Betty Parsons Gallery from 1946, the Janis Gallery from 1948 and so on. Each artist gets to show one early work and one late work. (The early ones are at Dintenfass, the later ones at Borgenicht, and both shows can be seen through Feb. 4.) Elayne H. Varian acted as guest curator, and the result certainly says something about fidelity in a context where fidelity is often thought to be in short supply. In particular the catalogue is one long love-in, with tributes heaped on all concerned. Those tributes are well deserved, as it happens, but do not guarantee a coherent exhibition. Loyalty proves nothing, in esthetic terms. Some of our best artists shop around among the dealers. Some of our best dealers have their piratical side. So there is simply no rationale whatever to these two shows, beyond the wish to give pleasure to a lot of good people, some of whom are distinctly more gifted than others. The exhibitions could be said to make most sense when the difference between early and late has something specific to tell us. Alice Neel's two portraits are an example of this. The ''Michael Auder'' of 1980 has a look of classical serenity, balance and refinement. The ''Robert Smithson'' of 1962 is almost identical in its pose, but a world away in all else. This could be a political prisoner awaiting interrogation, with a matching urgency in the brushwork and a pervading uneasiness in the drawing of shoulder and wrist. There is a striking difference, likewise, between Robert Gwathmey's straightforward botanical painting of 1966 and his ''Two Tables With Fruit'' of 1975, which could be labeled ''School of Helion'' without insult. Isabel Bishop manifests a less dramatic but no less significant evolution. Her ''Lunch Hour'' of 1939 is full of the niceties of social detail, whereas the students in her ''Variations on the Theme of Walking'' (1979) stride out like young gods who will never need to have a Social Security number. Many another conjunction of this kind can be made. Take the shows one piece at a time and feel free to skip, and you'll have a good time. Other 57th Street shows of interest: Anthony Caro (Andre Emmerich Gallery, 41 East 57th Street): Sculpture is like conducting an orchestra, in that the only way to learn it is to do it. There are sculptors like the short-lived Gaston Duchamp-Villon who have found favor with posterity on the basis of just five or six works, but they are the exception. The true professional sculptor is the sculptor who produces every day and, if possible, every hour of every day. Anthony Caro did not begin like that kind of sculptor. Many of the early metal works with which he made his name were laconic, fineboned structures, often large in scale, that took a big subject and said all that needed to be said about it. Definitive stat ements of that kind cannot be made every day. No one who is rethinking not only the aims of sculpture but also the mater ials of sculpture can produce on an industrial scale. But Caro has come a long way in the last 20 years. Completely at home in an idiom that is far from having exhausted its possibilities, he now feels able - or so it seems - to take a chance with materials that would once have seemed either taboo or irrelevant. Bronze is one of these. Caro got to be Caro by abandoning bronze and working with ready-made industrial material - material, as he once said, that had no art history in it. And now, more than 1,000 carefully catalogued sculptures later, he is back with bronze in his show of ''Bronze Screens and Table Sculptures,'' just as he was back with it not long ago at the Acquavella Galleries. Bronze is, of course, one of the most assertive of materials. To stop it from giving off a reek of art history is in itself an achievement. There is the further problem that whereas in 1962 a Caro looked like nothing that we had seen before, a Caro in 1982 is likely to look like another Caro, whether or not we see that as a compliment. So it is a considerable achievement that several of the smaller, lower, more ground-hugging new pieces in his show astonish us all over again by the energy and fertility of their invention.

Question: What is the capital of kentucky known for its bluegrass? Answer:","completion":"The capital of Kentucky is Frankfort. It is famously known for its bluegrass, a type of grass common in many American lawns but especially associated with Kentucky due to its rich, fertile soil that is particularly ideal for this plant. \\"Bluegrass\\" is also synonymous with a genre of music that originated in the region. The name for bluegrass music came from a band known as \\"Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys\\", who named themselves after Monroe's native state of Kentucky, the \\"Bluegrass State\\". The genre is known for its mix of old-time country, gospel, jug band, blues, and jazz and is characterized by quick tempos, high-pitched vocals, and vibrant narratives. In another context, Kentucky is known for its Bluegrass Region, where you'll find some of the most picturesque landscapes of the state, rolling acres of pastureland, and some of the world's finest horse farms. The region's limestone-rich soil has produced superior pasture land that has made it a center for breeding quality livestock, particularly thoroughbred horses.

Still in Deadlock On Secretary General UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 4— The United States and China continued to veto each other's candidates tonight, prolonging the Security Council's effort to choose a Secretary General. The Council held two more ballots and they differed little from the six of last week. On the first round, Salim A. Salim of Tanzania won the nine votes needed for election but the American veto stopped him. Kurt Waldheim, the incumbent, collected 10 votes on both ballots but his ambitions for an unprecedented third term were frustrated by China. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick of the United States said she wanted the Council to ''end the impasse by inviting other candidates in.'' Olara Otunnu of Uganda, Mr. Salim's unofficial manager, said: ''We are happy with the results. He could have been elected if the U.S. had not vetoed. We are going ahead full steam.'' Many diplomats think that the longer the stalemate lasts, the more Mr. Waldheim's chances improve, however damaged his prestige may be by the repeated rounds of rejection. Tonight's vote, held in secret but quickly announced, went like this: Mr. Waldheim received 10 ayes, 4 nays and an abstention on both rounds. Mr. Salim first collected 9 ayes, 2 nays and four abstentions. He then got 8 ayes, 3 nays and four abstentions.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. and the situation: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen. Answer the following question: Which friend had a field that attracted fewer insects? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information, it is evident that plants with wind-dispersed pollen typically have fewer traits that are specifically designed to attract insects, while flowering plants have features like brightly colored petals to entice pollinators. In the situation described, Joy has a field full of flowering plants that provide nectar for pollinators like insects, and it is implied that these plants have evolved traits to attract these pollinators. This symbiotic partnership between flowers and insects allows the plants to take advantage of \\"animal labor\\" during pollination, ensuring a higher rate of fertilization overall. On the other hand, Jill's field consists of plants that rely on wind for pollination. This means that these plants would not need the same adaptations and mechanisms to attract insects for carrying pollen from one plant to another. Wind-pollinated plants usually produce a substantial amount of pollen that gets carried away by the wind, with the hope that some might land on compatible flowers. These plants are not dependent on insects or other animal pollinators, so they typically lack brightly colored petals or nectar rewards to lure them in. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Jill's field of wind-pollinated plants would likely attract fewer insects compared to Joy's field of flowering plants specifically adapted to entice pollinators with color and nectar. Joy's field creates a mutually beneficial relationship between the flowering plants and insects, whereas Jill's field relies on a more random and passive method of pollination through wind dispersal that doesn't warrant active insect attraction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I live in walking distance and wanted for months to stop in. I finally walked in yesterday (Sunday) at around 4:00pm. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot and road. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Restaurant closed near by, I've been desperate for a consistent \\"go to\\" for noshing and drinks. Perfect Pear is a faux bistro with no bar, no charm and zero ambience. The restaurant smelled like smelly cheese - maybe cheap grated romano - so the patio was the escape. The menu offers typical easy-to-make, low risk, but high profit dishes. The drink menu is pedestrian and boring. No buttery chards and warm room temp reds. The waitress thought Pinot Gris was a misprint and apologized !?! So, the foodie in me already knows the pasta selections are embarrassingly ill conceived, so think American corporate like Chili's or Carraba's. So, what to do? Well, order something that few restaurants can screw up --- bruschetta!! Trendy, high profit, easy with fresh ingredients. The Classic came on soggy focaccia, hardly toasted, with tasteless, off-red tomatoes with red onion and julienne'd basil (not torn). Then, (get this) topped with cheap-of-the-cheap romano cheese (see above). Any shot at being edible was ruined by the grated romano. The Chef must have zero culinary instincts or just doesn't care because there is no real competition in the area. Unforgiveable. The Lolita was actually worse. Please don't say \\"avocado\\" when you really mean a brown guac spread. We ordered the olives and pesto goat cheese. Why ruin pesto with goat cheese? The crostini with the olives was the best part of the meal. My partner reconstructed the bruschetta using the crostini and the edible parts of what was served. I marvel at new owners who seemingly don't avail themselves of the basic \\"how to's\\" and \\"do's and dont's\\" of culinary. Please -- owner and chef -- do a dine around in Phoenix, take the entire week and then re-vamp your concept and menu. I'll be back in (3) months because I refuse to go to Native New Yorker. I'm serious. Much luck. D","completion":"The review is negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with various aspects of the restaurant and its offerings. They criticize the lack of a bar, charm, and ambiance, as well as the smell of the restaurant. Additionally, the reviewer is not impressed with the menu and drink options, stating they are typical and boring. They also take issue with the waitress's lack of knowledge on wine offerings and the poorly executed dishes they ordered. The reviewer's dissatisfaction extends to the restaurant's concept and menu, urging the owners and chefs to take inspiration from other establishments in the area. They suggest returning in three months to see if improvements have been made, as they refuse to go to another local option. The overall tone of the review is critical and negative, with the reviewer seemingly unsatisfied with their experience at the restaurant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Hematite is a form of iron oxide that contributes to the red color of various geological features, such as the Grand Canyon, and the red color of the planet Mars."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Nick Hendricks (Bateman) and Dale Arbus (Day) are friends who despise their bosses.

Question: \\"What term refers to people with authority to judge disputes, that comes from a Roman title tribunus?\\" Context: \\"International tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations. To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.\\" Answer:","completion":"The term that refers to people with authority to judge disputes, originating from the Roman title tribunus, is \\"tribunal.\\" In the context of international law and arbitration, tribunals and arbiters are those judicial bodies and individuals responsible for presiding over disputes and rendering decisions to resolve conflicts, often involving treaty interpretations and enforcement. During the Roman Republic, tribunus was a title granted to various officials with different roles. The most renowned were the Tribuni Plebis, who served as elected representatives to protect the rights and interests of the plebeians (common people) from the patricians (nobility). As time passed, the functions and authority of the Tribuni Plebis evolved, and they gained the power to veto legislation and actions by other officials. In modern legal contexts, international tribunals, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC), work to settle disputes between nations or prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other severe offenses. These judicial bodies use various sources of evidence, like preparatory work from treaty negotiations, the final signed treaty, and customary principles of international law, to determine the proper interpretation and application of the treaties in question. In summary, the term \\"tribunal\\" has its roots in the Roman title \\"tribunus.\\" Today, it refers to judicial bodies and individuals with the authority to judge disputes, particularly within the sphere of international law and arbitration.

Options: - fresher - healthier - i'm hungry - eat bread - tastes better than storebought Explain why a human would choose \\"fresher\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"fresher\\" as the answer to the question because making their own bread allows them to have more control over the entire process from start to finish. This leads to better taste and increased freshness compared to store-bought bread. There are several reasons behind this choice: 1. Quality of ingredients: When a person makes their own bread at home, they have complete control over the quality of ingredients they use. This means they can opt for high-quality, organic, and locally-sourced ingredients which can contribute to the overall freshness of the bread. In contrast, store-bought bread might have been made with lower-quality ingredients or preservatives to increase its shelf life, potentially compromising the freshness. 2. Immediate consumption: Homemade bread can be consumed shortly after it has been baked. This ensures peak freshness, as it doesn't have to go through the process of being transported, stocked on the shelves, and waiting to be purchased. On the other hand, store-bought bread may have been sitting on the shelf for some time before it is consumed, causing it to lose some of its initial freshness. 3. Absence of preservatives: Homemade bread typically lacks the preservatives found in store-bought bread. Preservatives are often used to extend the shelf life of commercially-made bread products, which can end up compromising their texture and flavor. By making bread at home, one can avoid these additives and experience a fresher loaf of bread. 4. Control over the baking process: Making bread at home allows for control over the entire baking process, including the fermentation time, dough handling, and baking conditions. This ensures that the bread is cooked to one's personal preference, further enhancing the freshness and overall eating experience. In the case of store-bought bread, the baking process has been standardized, and the end product may not be as close to one's personal preference. 5. Aromatic experience: The process of making bread at home fills the space with the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread, further enhancing the perception of freshness. This sensory experience is often lost when purchasing store-bought bread, as it is typically pre-packaged and the aroma is not as pronounced. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"fresher\\" as the answer because making bread at home gives them greater control over the ingredients, process, and timing. This results in a higher quality, fresher loaf of bread with more enticing flavors and aromas compared to store-bought options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Digestion: Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.

They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. Now, I have a new situation: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms.

Step 4: I will mention the important aspects of the movie, such as the plot, acting, and visual effects, and focus on their negative aspects. Step 5: I will include a conclusion to the review, which sums up the overall sentiment and provides a potential recommendation for readers. Review: \\"Justice League\\" (2017) failed to meet the towering expectations set by its roster of iconic superheroes, resulting in a disappointingly underwhelming cinematic experience. The convoluted plot seemed to struggle in finding its footing, and as a result, it left viewers feeling disoriented instead of captivated. As for performances, the ensemble cast delivered a mixed bag of incongruous chemistry. The individual portrayals of beloved characters like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman were adequate, but their interactions throughout the movie often felt offbeat and unnatural. It was as if the actors were running in parallel worlds, never really merging or connecting in the way fans might have anticipated. The visual effects were a far cry from what one would expect from a big-budget superhero movie. Instead of being awe-inspiring, they were mostly dismal, and at times felt so overused that they detracted from the storytelling. In conclusion, the 2017 \\"Justice League\\" is a let-down for fans of the iconic comic book heroes. With its disjointed narrative, weak character dynamics, and subpar visual effects, it's tough to muster a recommendation – even for die-hard superhero enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apply the cleanser over your face in a circular motion so that it exfoliates your skin properly. Rinse your face softly with a warm washcloth to wash away all traces of cleanser. Explanation: [a] is incorrect because removing makeup and exfoliating should be done before the current step of dampening your face with a warm washcloth. [c] is incorrect because applying a thin layer of cleanser right after getting out of the shower is not relevant to the current context. The steps should follow the moistening of your face with a warm washcloth. [d] is incorrect because it suggests that wiping your face with a clean rag or damp sponge will cause more makeup to show, which is not the case if the face was cleaned properly in previous steps.
