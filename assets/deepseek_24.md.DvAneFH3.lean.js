Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods. In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage of more than 15 million volts . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Thomas Wesley Pentz (born November 10, 1978), better known by his stage name Diplo, is an American DJ, record producer, rapper and songwriter based in Los Angeles, California. He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia. Diplo was born on November 10, 1978, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the son of Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz. He is of German and English descent. The influence of home-grown rap played a key role in helping shape his production style. He spent the majority of his youth in Miami, where he got a taste for the characteristic Miami bass. He began attending the University of Central Florida in 1997, and then moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at Temple University, where he first garnered attention as a DJ. After frequently running into fellow DJ Low Budget, the two began throwing parties under the Hooked on Hollertronix moniker in 2003 as a way of maintaining control of what they were able to play during DJ gigs in Philadelphia. The success of these parties allowed the two to release mixtapes, both separate and together, gathering acclaim across the country. One such mixtape, Never Scared, was named one of the New York Times top ten albums of 2003, and the Hollertronix name became synonymous with parties featuring guests like Maluca Mala, Bun B, Spank Rock, M.I.A., among others. Hollertronix's sound has been described as \\"disparate genres to be smashed together for maximum attention-grabbing impact\\" an aesthetic which takes from the \\"organic, cohesive, whole\\" aesthetic of acts such as Bun B, Lil Jon, Drama, M.I.A., Bjork, Busta Rhymes, and others. Diplo accentuated the club aesthetic of his Hollertronix music for a more reflective sound on his solo debut, Florida, which was released on the Ninja Tune imprint, Big Dada Records. The album Florida was pressed twice, first with a CD and the second with a CD and DVD. The DVD was created by System D-128, another artist who has collaborated with Diplo on some audio and video projects. Before Florida's DVD accompaniment, another DVD surfaced called Diplo: \\"Banned in Libya\\" which was released by Money Studies, the first label to release a solo project by Diplo under his original DJ name Diplodocus. It was a 45 rpm record called \\"Thingamajawn\\" for which there is also a music video System D-128 directed. Similar to the Florida DVD, \\"Banned in Libya\\" is an experimental audio and video mix of some of Diplo's original music blended with a number of other unidentified sources. His particular affinity for one genre of music called baile funk, or favela funk, would spawn a series of mixtapes (Favela on Blast, Favela Strikes Back), which served to bring the Brazilian dance music of the ghettos to the United States. It was not long before his Hooked on Hollertronix parties would provide him the success necessary to move to the next logical step and build a studio where music would become his full-time focus. With this goal in mind, Diplo built \\"The Mausoleum,\\" a video studio, recording studio, record label office, gallery, and event space in Philadelphia. Since its inception, The Mausoleum has become the home to recordings by artists like Christina Aguilera, Shakira, M.I.A., Santigold, Spank Rock, Plastic Little, Blaqstarr, Paper Route Gangstaz, and hosted concerts by Glass Candy, Skream, Boys Noize, Nicos Gun, and more.

Question: What is the first name of the person who suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees? Answer the above question based on the context below: Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on CNN's Crossfire TV series and debated issues with Washington Times commentator John Lofton in 1986. On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

He hurries to be first in line to sign up with the Confederate Army, but is rejected because he is too valuable in his present job; unfortunately, Johnnie is not told this reason and is forcibly ejected from the office when he tries to enlist surreptitiously. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle's father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he sadly walks away, giving them the impression that he does not want to enlist. Annabelle coldly informs Johnnie that she will not speak to him again until he is in uniform. A year passes, and Annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded.

In an NaCl crystal, how can each of them make 6 bonds while their valency is 1? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions you posed essentially ask the same thing, with slightly different wording. Both inquire about the formation of 6 bonds between sodium and chloride in an NaCl crystal considering their valency is one. Therefore, I will provide an in-depth answer that addresses the main subject of your questions. In an NaCl (sodium chloride) crystal, it is important to understand that the crystal structure is not based on the sharing of electrons through covalent bonds, which the concept of valency typically refers to. Instead, NaCl is an ionic compound, forming ionic bonds that result in the regular arrangement of sodium (Na+) cations and chloride (Cl-) anions. These ionic bonds form through the electrostatic attraction between positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). Due to the ionization of the atoms, the valency of one in each atom is satisfied. The NaCl crystal structure can be described as a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of chloride ions with sodium ions occupying all the octahedral holes. To elaborate, in the fcc arrangement, each chloride ion is surrounded by 6 sodium ions, and conversely, each sodium ion is surrounded by 6 chloride ions. This 6-fold coordination is the result of ionic packing which determines the position and geometrical arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice. The crucial factor here is the efficient packing, not the valency. Even though the valency of Na and Cl is one, the 6-fold coordination in the crystal structure is due to the need for an efficient packing arrangement in the lattice and not the electrostatic interaction of valencies to make bonds. Therefore, when considering NaCl's ionic bonding, there is still only one full electrostatic interaction between one sodium ion and one chloride ion. In the fcc lattice, each ion is at the center of an octahedron formed by the six nearest ions of the opposite charge. The confusion arises when one tries to apply the concept of valency for covalent bonds to an ionic compound. While valency indeed refers to the number of bonds that an atom can form in covalent bonds, this principle does not translate directly to ionic compounds. Ionic bonds, like those in an NaCl crystal, are formed instead through the electrostatic interactions between charged particles. In conclusion, while the valency of sodium and chloride is one, their 6-fold coordination in an NaCl crystal structure is due to efficient packing, and not the formation of 6 covalent bonds. Ion arrangement in the crystal lattice is determined by the need for efficient packing rather than the electrostatic interaction of valencies as in the case of covalent bonds."},{"prompt":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

How do batteries work? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Yes, both questions essentially ask for the same information, which is an explanation of how batteries function. I'll provide an explanation of the inner workings of a battery, addressing the request from both questions. Step 1: Understand the basic components A battery typically consists of three main components: a cathode (positive terminal), an anode (negative terminal), and an electrolyte. These components are housed within a container. Step 2: Identify the key processes The fundamental process behind a battery's function is the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. This is achieved through redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions occurring between the cathode, anode, and electrolyte. Step 3: Explain the redox reactions During a redox reaction, electrons are transferred between the cathode and anode. Usually, the anode undergoes oxidation, losing electrons, while the cathode undergoes reduction, gaining electrons. The electrolyte helps to facilitate this electron transfer by conducting ions, but not electrons, maintaining charge neutrality within the battery. Step 4: Explain the role of the external circuit An external circuit connects the anode and cathode, providing a path for electrons to flow from the anode (where they are in excess) to the cathode. When a device is connected to this circuit, the flow of electrons provides electrical energy to power the device. Step 5: Describe the battery discharge process As the battery discharges, the redox reactions deplete the chemicals within the anode and cathode, and the battery's potential difference (voltage) starts to drop. Eventually, the battery will be unable to deliver the required electrical energy, at which point it is considered \\"dead\\" or depleted. Step 6: Explain rechargeability (for rechargeable batteries) In rechargeable batteries (e.g., lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride), the redox reactions can be reversed by connecting the battery to an external electrical energy source. This recharging process replenishes the chemicals within the anode and cathode and restores the battery's potential difference, allowing it to deliver electrical energy once again. By breaking down the process into these steps, I've explained the inner workings of a battery and addressed both of the user's questions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Food and Drug Administration are reviewing what establishments should be forced to display calorie counts on their menus, with the idea that many people - ordering at a diner, for example - would pass on that bacon double cheeseburger if they realized it had 1,000 calories. The food industry is closely watching what the FDA will chose to include in their new menu labeling rules, which are due out this year. Grocery stores, convenient stores, movie theaters and airplanes are under review - and many aren't happy about it. Non-restaurant establishments have lobbied hard for exemption, which has lead to a delay in the release of the rules. Calorie count menus, which have been commonplace at establishments like McDonalds (pictured) since 2008, look set to be expanded into a whole new line of places that serve prepared food. The FDA believes people would order healthier if they were more aware of the calories in each menu item. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told Congress earlier this month that writing the rules has been 'much more challenging than expected'. The agency issued proposed rules in 2011 but has faced pressure to revise them to exclude retail outlets like grocery and convenience stores. The FDA has sent the rules to the White House, meaning they could be released soon. The restaurant industry pushed for menu labeling and helped it become law as part of health overhaul in 2010. Chain restaurants that operate all over the country wanted the federal standards because of an evolving patchwork of state and local laws that require calorie labeling and could have forced those outlets to follow different rules in different locations. Not all restaurants are happy with menu labeling, though. Pizza restaurants, led by delivery giant Domino's, say it doesn't make sense to force their franchisees to order expensive new menu boards when few people walk into their brick-and-mortar outlets. They argue for putting the information online. The pizza companies say there are more than 34 million ways to order a pizza, and they need more flexibility on labeling than other restaurants. Against: Domino's are one of the main establishments fighting the would-be rules, claiming it is intellectual for them to overhaul their menu boards when rarely do people actually order food over-the-counter. Supporters of the rules say pizzas are no different from sandwiches or other foods that have a variety of toppings. The rules will only apply to restaurants with 20 or more outlets, so independent eateries are exempt. Bakeries, coffee shops and ice cream parlors are all expected to be included if they have enough stores to qualify. But alcohol won't have to be labeled in any of those places under the proposed rules. The FDA proposed exempting it. Perhaps the most unhappy with the rules that the FDA proposed in 2011 were the supermarket and convenience store industries were . The agency proposed requiring those stores to label calories for prepared foods on menu boards and displays. The restaurant industry has pushed for those outlets to be included, arguing that many of them are promoting their prepared food sales and directly competing with restaurants. Nutrition advocates have also called for those stores to be included, saying that a rotisserie chicken labeled with a calorie count at a restaurant should also be labeled at the grocery store takeout next door. Same with baked goods like muffins, pies or loaves of bread. Target: Movie theaters are among those most likely to display their calories under the FDA rules, with their snacks often being so unhealthy. The supermarket industry estimates it could cost them a billion dollars to put the rules in place — costs that would be passed on to consumers. Along with convenience stores, the supermarkets say the ever-changing selection at salad bars, deli counters and other prepared food stations would make it difficult and costly to nail down accurate calorie counts and constantly update signs. Both industries argue that the law is intended for restaurants and not for them. They say the labeling rules will be much easier to put in place at restaurants with fixed menus. 'The cost of compliance for a convenience store is different than a one-time cost to McDonald's,' says Lyle Beckwith of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Movie theater chains lobbied to be exempt and appeared to win that fight when they were exempted in the 2011 proposed rules. But nutrition groups are lobbying to include them in the final rules, especially because movie treats can be so unhealthy. Nutrition lobbyist Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest says many people don't realize they are eating a day's worth of calories when they stop by the movie concessions counter and grab a large popcorn and extra-large soda. Vending machines will also display signs indicating the calories of each treat. 'If a company is going to serve you 2,000 calories and call it a snack, the least they can do is tell people how many calories are in it,' Wootan says. Passengers will most likely be able to purchase food calorie-blind in the air and on the rails. Along with movie theaters, airlines and trains were exempted from the proposed labeling rules in 2011. The FDA said that it would likely exempt food served in places where the 'primary business activity is not the sale of food' and that don't 'present themselves publicly as a restaurant'. That also includes amusement parks, sports stadiums and hotels, unless restaurants set up in those places are part of a larger chain. Vending machines will be required to have labels, but the industry — comprised mostly of smaller operators — is asking for flexibility in how they are required to post them. Eric Bell of the National Automatic Merchandising Association says the group estimates the rules could cost operators up to 42,000 a year, which he calls a \\"huge burden\\" on those small businesses. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is thinking about which places should show how many calories are in the food they serve. This will help people know if the food they are ordering is healthy or not. Some places like McDonald's are already doing this. But other places like grocery stores, movie theaters, and airplanes are not happy about it because they don't want to spend money to change their menus. Pizza restaurants like Domino's say it's better to put the information online, because they have many ways to order pizza and people usually don't walk inside their stores. The rules will only apply to places with 20 or more locations, so smaller independent restaurants don't have to worry about it. The FDA is still deciding which places should show calorie counts and some places like movie theaters and amusement parks might not have to do it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The three films were directed by Vincenzo Natali , Andrzej Sekua , and Ernie Barbarash respectively . All three films are based on the same premise : there is a gigantic , mechanical , cubical structure of unknown purpose and origin , made up of lots of smaller cubical rooms . Each of these rooms has six doors , one on each face of the cube , which lead into adjacent , identically decorated rooms , only differing by colour . Some of these rooms are \`\` safe '' , while others are equipped with deadly booby traps such as flamethrowers and razorwire . In some cases it is possible to detect a trap by throwing an object into the room first , although this method is not always reliable due to the trigger mechanism of certain traps . In each case , a group of strangers awakens in this mysterious structure , without any knowledge of how or why they are there . In order to escape from the prison , they must band together and use their combined skills and talents to avoid the traps and navigate out of the maze , while also trying to solve the mystery of what the cube is and why they are in it . However , the pressure of being in the Cube generally turns one of the prisoners into a homicidal maniac who preys on the others . Cube Zero was slightly different from the first two films in that it also dealt with the people on the outside of the Cube whose job it was to control the cube and oversee those within . In March 2011 , Lionsgate announced it was considering an additional film in the series , tentatively titled Cube 3D . In April 2015 , The Hollywood Reporter announced that Lionsgate Films are planning to remake the original movie under the title Cubed , with Saman Kesh as director . - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

He turned around the narrative from the first debate -- that he was listless and lethargic and on the defensive -- by showing up with energy and determination. In fact, Obama actually said, \\"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\\" This statement highlighted his dedication to maintaining the nation's strength and resilience in the face of adversity. However, showing up is one thing, winning is another. Obama needed a convincing win Tuesday night, and he did not get it. Gov.

Tuesday night Romney delivered again and proved his performance was consistent and legitimate. He has established himself as a legitimate alternative to the president. Both candidates shared passionate exchanges on a number of issues, with Romney highlighting his plans for job creation and economic growth, while Obama emphasized his administration's accomplishments on healthcare, education, and foreign policy. The intense nature of the debate allowed both candidates to present their respective visions for the country's future, helping undecided voters make a more informed choice. In the end, the second debate did not provide the knockout blow that Obama supporters had hoped for, but it did give the president an opportunity to regain some of the momentum he had lost after the first debate. Similarly, Romney continued to prove his credibility as a strong challenger. The debate did not change the overall dynamics of the presidential race significantly, but it did serve to emphasize the stark differences between the two candidates and reinforced the importance of their leadership in guiding the nation in difficult times."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Goal: microwave Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, there needs to be clarity regarding the specific goal that involves a microwave. Since the provided goal \\"microwave\\" is not sufficient to understand the intended outcome, I will cover two common scenarios in which a microwave is involved. These scenarios will be A) purchasing a microwave and B) heating food in a microwave. For each scenario, I will discuss reasonable methods in accomplishing the goal. Scenario A: Purchasing a Microwave 1. Research and compare microwave models online: Visiting websites such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart will help you do thorough research on various microwave models available in the market. You can compare features, specifications, pricing, and user reviews before making a decision. This method provides the convenience of researching multiple models and comparing them side by side, from the comfort of your home. 2. Visit a local electronics store: Visiting a nearby electronics or appliance store is another reasonable method for purchasing a microwave. By doing this, you can inspect the microwaves in-person, consult with sales personnel, and make a more informed decision based on their recommendations. This option also may provide the opportunity to negotiate price and take immediate possession of the appliance. Scenario B: Heating Food in a Microwave 1. Follow the food item's instructions: If you are heating a prepackaged food item such as a frozen meal, the most reasonable method is to follow the instructions provided on the package. These directions have been specifically designed for the item and should provide the optimal heating time and power settings for your microwave. 2. Utilize the sensor cooking feature (if available): Modern microwaves often come with sensor cooking features that automatically adjust the cooking time and power level based on the moisture content of the food. By placing the food in the microwave and selecting the appropriate sensor cooking mode, the microwave will automatically determine the best time and power settings for the food item. This method is a convenient option for those who are unsure about the required heating time and power settings. 3. Estimate heating time using general guidelines: If neither the food item's instructions nor microwave sensor cooking features are available, a reasonable method in this situation would be to estimate the heating time based on general guidelines. For example: - For frozen meals, a standard guideline would be to microwave it for 3 to 4 minutes per 100 grams of food, at half power. - For reheating leftovers or precooked meals, the typical recommendation is around 2 minutes at full power for a single portion. It is important to note that these guidelines should be considered as a starting point and that monitoring the food item while heating is essential to avoid overcooking or uneven heating. Reheating in intervals (pausing to stir or reposition the food) may also be helpful to achieve desired results. Given the multiple scenarios and methods provided, it's not possible to determine which method is more reasonable without more information about the specific goal involving a microwave. However, the scenarios demonstrate various methods, tailored to different goals, that are reasonable and practical in achieving the intended outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Toolbox: A toolbox is usually a portable storage container for tools, including saws, wrenches, and screwdrivers. However, the question states that the saw is too big to fit with all the other tools, making this option less suitable. 2. Cabinet: A cabinet is a storage unit with shelves and drawers, typically larger than a toolbox. Since the saw is too big to fit with other tools, a cabinet may be a suitable option as it can provide additional and separate storage space. 3. Basement: A basement is a large space beneath a building, providing ample room for storage. However, it does not specifically cater to organizing tools and may not be the most appropriate solution. 4. Toolshed: A toolshed is a small building used for storing tools and equipment. This option is suitable given the size of the saw and the need to store it with other tools. 5. Tool kit: A tool kit usually contains a specific set of tools designed to perform particular tasks. Since the saw is too big to fit with the other tools, it's unlikely to fit in a general tool kit.

Question: Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy because of who? Movie plot title: Raging Bull Movie plot: The film opens in 1964, where an older and fatter Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) practices his stand-up comic routine before his debut at a comedy nightclub. A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey has a word with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. When Tommy Como hears... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy because of Vickie. In the movie Raging Bull, Jake becomes increasingly jealous of the attention his wife, Vickie, receives from other men. He suspects that she may have feelings for someone else, especially Tony Janiro, whom Jake eventually beats in a fight to display his dominance. As the movie progresses, Joey gets into a fight with Salvy, in part due to a tense dynamic between the characters and rising suspicions about Salvy's connection to Vickie. This leads Jake to confront Joey about his motives for the fight and question if it was because of Vickie that Joey fought with Salvy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to wear appropriate colors for a job interview Understand that colors can signify different personality traits. Different colors and shades make our environment, and they also send different signals to our brain and invoke varied responses. Because of this, it is important to think about the colors you are wearing and what they say about you. OPT: [-] Finding an outfit to wear with color for job interviews can go a long way towards achieving your desired look and tone. Dress in bright colors, but wear something comfortable.; [-] Otherwise, you may not be as aware of what the environment will hold, for example. The color blues, blues, and greens are often used for formal events.; [-] A recently published survey by careerbuilder revealed that black and blue are regarded as the best colors to wear on a job interview while orange is the worst. In a professional setting, the safest bet is to go for a conservative color.; [-] Draw out any emotions in your already-happy demeanor. These \\" emotions \\" can only be classified as \\" shyness \\" or \\" boredom.;","completion":"[-] A recently published survey by CareerBuilder revealed that black and blue are regarded as the best colors to wear on a job interview while orange is considered the worst. In a professional setting, it is always safe to lean towards a conservative color palette. Interestingly, black signifies leadership qualities while blue suggests that the wearer is dependable and trustworthy. On the contrary, curious as it may seem, orange is least preferred since it often hints at the wearer being either unprofessional or overly audacious, neither of which are generally desirable traits in a professional setting. Navigating the color spectrum, one can consider other colors like green and brown which suggest calmness, stability, and reliability but they may not represent dynamism. For a pop of color, a burgundy tie or lavender blouse can demonstrate confidence and creativity without crossing the line of professionalism. White is another safe option that communicates simplicity, cleanliness, and precision. If you're going for a lighter palette, pastel shades, especially of blue and pink, can help project a calm and cooperative nature. However, it's important to balance these color implications with factors like the interview's context, your role, the company culture, and even the industry you're in. For instance, if you're interviewing for a creative role, brighter colors might be welcome and could illustrate your vibrant creativity. In contrast, financial and legal industries lean towards classic, deep colors to represent tradition and stability. In conclusion, when choosing an outfit for a job interview, steer clear of excessively bright colors or bold patterns that might distract or even put off the interviewer. Instead, promote a professional image by opting for more subdued, conservative colors. While black and blue are safe bets, do not hesitate to incorporate subtle variations based on the industry, role, and company culture. After all, the goal is to feel confident and present a smart, well-put-together professional image, and appropriately chosen colors can play a crucial role in achieving that."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Eat when you’re hungry Eat what you want Eat consciously Stop when you are full The difference lies in the approach and the detail. I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel. YOU CAN STILL EAT DIET FOOD Low fat ice-cream, Diet Coke and protein powder are still in my diet but I eat them because I prefer the taste over their ‘real’ counterparts.

The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. and the situation: James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. Answer the following question: Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","completion":"the vapor light is more energy efficient than the regular light bulb. There are a few reasons why vapor lights are more energy efficient compared to regular light bulbs. Firstly, vapor lights, like sodium vapor and mercury vapor lights, have a higher efficiency by converting a greater portion of electrical energy into visible light. This is primarily due to the process of electroluminescence, which occurs when an electric current passes through the gases within the bulb. This causes the solid sodium or mercury to vaporize and emit visible light. The higher efficiency directly translates to lower energy consumption for the same amount of light output produced. In terms of luminous efficacy, which is a measure of how well a light source converts electricity into visible light, vapor lights are superior to regular light bulbs. For instance, sodium vapor lights typically have a luminous efficacy of around 100-150 lumens per watt, whereas mercury vapor lights can have values between 35-65 lumens per watt. In comparison, traditional incandescent light bulbs have a much lower luminous efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watt. This means that vapor lights produce much more visible light for the same amount of electricity consumed, making them more energy efficient. Additionally, vapor lights are known for their longer lifespans in comparison to regular light bulbs. Sodium vapor and mercury vapor lights can last between 12,000 to 24,000 hours, whereas traditional incandescent light bulbs have an average lifespan of 1,000 to 2,000 hours. This longer lifespan reduces the need for frequent replacements, which not only saves energy but also reduces maintenance costs and contributes to less waste generation. Another factor to consider is that vapor lights are generally used in outdoor applications, such as streetlights, where they need to provide sufficient illumination over large areas. In these situations, energy efficiency is crucial to cater the needs of a large-scale lighting infrastructure with minimal energy consumption and maintenance efforts. In conclusion, based on the process of electroluminescence, higher luminous efficacy, and longer lifespan, vapor lights are more energy-efficient compared to regular light bulbs, making them suitable as a more sustainable and cost-effective lighting solution, particularly in outdoor applications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I hate it when airlines lie about arrival times Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet is a strong negative emotion, primarily frustration, directed towards airlines that intentionally or unintentionally provide inaccurate information about their flight's arrival times. It signifies the dissatisfaction and annoyance experienced by the person who posted the tweet, potentially due to a personal experience they may have had related to the subject matter. This sentiment likely stems from multiple factors, including expectations being set by the airlines and then not being met, as well as the inconvenience caused by unexpected delays or altered travel plans. The statement conveys a sense of disappointment and mistrust, as the person feels misled or deceived by these inaccurate claims. It also highlights an underlying belief or expectation that airlines should be transparent and truthful about their flight schedules and any potential changes thereof. In addition to expressing annoyance, the tweet implies the potentially negative impact that such practices can have on the reputation of airlines. It suggests that this dishonest or unreliable behavior might lead to a loss of credibility, consumer trust, and customer loyalty. This criticism could be particularly revealing, given that people often rely on airlines to provide seamless transportation and expect them to be reliable and efficient. The choice of the word \\"lie\\" in the tweet also suggests a strong emotional response. It implies deliberate deception, which contributes to the feeling of betrayal and mistrust that the person tweets about. The word carries a heavy connotation, indicating a serious issue that needs addressing by the airlines in question. As a result, the sentiment embodied in the tweet reflects a deep-rooted frustration and dissatisfaction towards the airline industry's practices concerning arrival times. It highlights the importance of maintaining honest and transparent communication between service providers and customers and the potential consequences if this trust is compromised.

She said “are you kidding” and then said she didn’t want to talk to me, before actually being unable to talk due to work. When she comes back I call her a pet name, and she tells me not to call her that. I apologize, use another, only to be told not to call her anything, to which I apologize again, not only for using pet names when she’s not in the mood but also for previously upsetting her. I do, however, say that I was just trying to make a joke, and she goes into how she thought she could trust me in talking about her sexuality with me and how I have never called her straight as a joke before, and it hurts because while she’s fine with hella gay being that gay is a blanket term, being called straight reminds her of people who say bi people in straight relationships are just straight. I repeat that I was just mocking that behavior, and say that I had previously made the exact joke, and recently. She says she doesn’t remember, so I find a screenshot from the weekend where she said she felt gay and I said “and you find me hot? That’s pretty fuckin’ straight” to no ill effects. She then said “fuck you” and “you always have to be right” before telling me not to talk to her. I oblige for a bit, then text her a paragraph of apology which she responds by saying she can’t forgive me until I apologize in person. So reddit, am I the asshole?

Choose a movie: I will select a popular movie to write a negative review of. In this case, I've chosen the movie \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction\\" (2014). 2. Watch the movie: In order to write an honest review, I would watch the movie to understand its plot, characters, and visual effects. 3. Analyze story and screenplay: I will pay close attention to the movie's narrative, dialogue, pacing and overall storyline, and identify any weaknesses or issues. 4. Evaluate acting: I will assess the acting performances by the movie's main characters and supporting roles, and analyze if any of them were subpar or problematic. 5. Assess visual effects and action sequences: Since \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction\\" is an action movie, I will analyze its visual effects and action scenes to determine whether they meet audience expectations or fall short. 6. Write the review: Finally, I will write the negative movie review, detailing the identified weaknesses in the story, acting, visual effects, and overall satisfaction. Here's the negative movie review for \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction\\" (2014): \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction,\\" directed by Michael Bay, is a disappointing addition to the popular Transformers movie franchise. The film utilizes an excessive runtime of 165 minutes to deliver a convoluted and overblown plot that ultimately falls short of audience expectations. The story, centering around the battle between Autobots and Decepticons, appears to have undergone a transformation of its own - into a confusing, disjointed mess. Although the initial promise of an interesting human-robot alliance offers some intrigue, it quickly gives way to a jumble of subplots and unnecessary characters. As for the acting, Mark Wahlberg's performance as the film's lead, Cade Yeager, is decidedly underwhelming. Though he has his moments, most of his heroics are overshadowed by poor character development and weak dialogue. Furthermore, the overuse of clichéd one-liners does little to elevate the movie from the quagmire of mediocrity. Action sequences and visual effects should be the cornerstone of any Transformers movie, but \\"Age of Extinction\\" suffers from a series of protracted and repetitive scenes. Instead of delivering thrills, they create a sense of fatigue, leaving viewers disengaged. In summary, \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction\\" is a letdown in terms of both storytelling and spectacle. Despite its lofty ambitions and potential for exciting action sequences, the movie leaves much to be desired and ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying experience for fans of the Transformers universe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. The answer is:","completion":"The most abundant group of people in Brazil in 1872 were the browns, who made up 38.3% of the population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate to English","completion":"I advocate for a Europe-wide mandatory installation of automatic fire extinguishing systems in the engine compartment, which already exist in motorsports. Your concerns about vehicle safety are valid, especially when it comes to preventing fires in the engine compartment. The benefits of mandating automatic fire extinguishing systems in the engine compartment of all vehicles across Europe would go beyond motorsports and could potentially save lives and reduce damages caused by vehicle fires. Firstly, implementing such systems can significantly enhance passenger and driver safety. Engine fires can be life-threatening and can lead to severe accidents; therefore, having an automatic fire-extinguishing system in place can help limit these risks by swiftly detecting and suppressing a fire. This early intervention can prevent fires from spreading to other areas of the vehicle or causing further damage to the vehicle's surrounding environment. Moreover, these fire-suppression systems benefit the environment by reducing air pollution caused by vehicle fires. By promptly extinguishing a fire, the system would minimize the release of hazardous chemicals and smoke into the atmosphere. This is particularly important as the automotive industry moves towards a greener future. In addition, implementing such systems in all vehicles across Europe would indirectly contribute to economic benefits. With quicker fire detection and suppression, fewer vehicles will end up being destroyed as a result of engine fires, reducing claims under insurance policies and resulting in lower premiums for consumers. This would also mean less expense for emergency services, as they would have to respond to fewer vehicle fire incidents. Furthermore, the mandatory installation of automatic suppression systems would create new opportunities for manufacturers to develop cutting-edge fire safety technology for the automotive industry. This would not only open up a lucrative market for new technologies but would also lead to the development of advanced systems, enhancing the fire safety in vehicles even further. Lastly, implementing such systems in vehicles would raise public awareness about fire safety and the importance of having effective fire-protection measures. This could lead to more responsible behavior on the part of drivers, ultimately reducing the number of vehicle fires. In conclusion, making the installation of automatic fire-extinguishing systems mandatory across Europe would benefit vehicle safety, the environment, and the economy. It would lead to increased innovation in the automotive industry and promote a greater sense of responsibility among drivers. The investment in such systems is likely to pay off in the long run, resulting in a safer and more sustainable future for European motorists."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Because of the threats and despotic policies employed by the Darwinist dictatorship, people have been unable to openly express their opposition to Darwinism, and have even had to role play, up until today. The concept of a Darwinist dictatorship refers to a hypothetical authoritarian regime where the principles of Darwinism, especially the ideas of natural selection and evolution, are forced upon the population without allowing room for dissent or alternative viewpoints. This hypothetical scenario is often used as a criticism against the scientific validity and moral implications associated with the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. It is important to note that the term \\"Darwinist dictatorship\\" is primarily used by critics of Darwinism and does not represent a real-world political system. It is often used as a rhetorical device to showcase the perceived authoritarian nature of Darwinism being taught as the primary explanation for the origin and diversity of life on Earth. Critics argue that by not allowing room for alternative theories, such as those related to intelligent design or creationism, a metaphorical dictatorship is created in the educational and scientific communities. The notion of a Darwinist dictatorship silencing opposition and coercing individuals into role-playing as supporters of Darwinism is not grounded in factual evidence. In reality, scientific discourse and academic debate are encouraged in most democratic societies. The theory of evolution is widely accepted by the scientific community because of its strong empirical backing and its ability to accurately explain and predict various biological phenomena. However, the idea of a Darwinist dictatorship highlights the need for open discussion and critical evaluation of scientific theories, including evolution, in order to ensure that scientific advancements are not hindered by ideological dogma or political agendas. It is essential for society to foster a respectful and inclusive environment for scientific inquiry and debate, with the understanding that scientific knowledge is provisional and subject to revision as new evidence emerges.

The translation provided above illustrates the scenario where the CALDH (Center for Legal Action on Human Rights) might need to transfer a case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights if local or national courts are incapable of providing a fair and just resolution. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, situated in San José, Costa Rica, is an autonomous judicial institution responsible for upholding and promoting human rights in the American continent. Established in 1979, the Court not only settles cases (contentious jurisdiction) but also issues advisory opinions (advisory jurisdiction) to member states of the Organization of American States (OAS). The mention of transferring the case to Europe suggests that if the Inter-American Court of Human Rights proves to be ineffective in resolving the matter, more options might be available to seek justice in Europe, perhaps in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR is a supranational court established in 1959, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights, a treaty signed by the 47 member states of the Council of Europe. Its primary function is to hear claims of human rights violations by individuals or entities against the member states. Although the primary jurisdictions of both Courts (Inter-American Court of Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights) are geographically and organizationally distinct, it is worth noting that in some circumstances, international collaboration and cooperation might be required to address certain human rights issues effectively. Furthermore, some countries have established tribunals or courts tailored to address specific human rights violations, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), making it possible for cases to be transferred to Europe in certain circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usage: Title: Suspended. Sentences: 1. The boy got suspended from school. 2. He liked the time off. 3. He acted up again. 4. He was hoping to get suspended. In this situation, we have the title and four sentences that form the context of the story. Part #2: Understand the two sentence options for the fifth sentence. Usage: Options: a. The boy got expelled. b. Travis lost the race and his bike. Here, we have two options for the fifth sentence that may or may not relate to the story. Part #3: Choose the sentence that does not connect with the rest of the story. Usage: Choice 'b' does not connect with the rest of the story. The sentence \\"Travis lost the race and his bike\\" has no connection to the boy's suspension and his behavior. It talks about a race and a bike, which are unrelated to the existing storyline. Part #4: Determine if both sentences are plausible and if so, choose the one that makes less sense. Usage: In this case, choice 'a' is plausible as it shows a consequence of the boy's actions (getting expelled), but choice 'b' is less plausible since it is unrelated. We would go with choice 'b' as it makes less sense in the context of the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Options: ['a ) 3 hours', 'b ) 4 hours 15 minutes', 'c ) 6 hours', 'd ) 2 hours 5 minutes', 'e ) 8 hours'] Output:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task The task is to find out how long it took to fill the drum completely with rainwater. Step 2: Use the given information We know that: - The rain has been falling at a rate of 5 centimeters per hour - The drum is a cylinder with a depth of 15 centimeters - The drum has an area of 300 square centimeters Step 3: Calculate the volume of the drum Since the drum is a cylinder, we can calculate its volume by multiplying the depth by the area. Volume = Depth × Area Volume = 15 cm × 300 cm² Volume = 4500 cubic centimeters Step 4: Determine how long it took to fill the drum To find out how long it took to fill the drum, we can divide the volume of the drum by the rate of rainfall. Time = Volume ÷ Rate of rainfall Time = 4500 cubic centimeters ÷ 5 centimeters per hour Time = 900 hours Step 5: Convert the time from hours to hours and minutes To convert hours to hours and minutes, we can multiply the decimal part by 60. 900 hours = 9 hours + (0.00 * 60) minutes = 9 hours Step 6: Match the answer with the given options Our answer, 9 hours, is not listed in the given options.

Burrel's innovative design, which combined the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's CPU, the Motorola 68K, received the attention of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the \\"Snow White\\" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985. He went on to found NeXT, another computer company targeting the education market, and did not return until 1997, when Apple acquired NeXT.

Sentence 2: Herbert Hepburn Calvert was born on 30 December 1870 in London. He was the first son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace (née Hepburn). Step 2: Identify the information given in both sentences. Sentence 1: - Herbert Hepburn Calvert's birth in London - Birthdate: December 30, 1870 - First son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace - Grace's maiden name: near Hepburn Sentence 2: - Herbert Hepburn Calvert's birth in London - Birthdate: 30 December 1870 - First son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace - Grace's maiden name: née Hepburn Step 3: Compare the information provided in both sentences to evaluate if they mean the same thing. The information shared in both sentences is similar with one minor difference. In Sentence 1, Grace's maiden name is given as \\"near Hepburn,\\" while in Sentence 2, it is rightly given as \\"née Hepburn.\\" Since 'née' means 'originally born as' or 'formerly known as', the phrase 'née Hepburn' in Sentence 2 indicates that Grace's maiden name was Hepburn before her marriage.

Aside from the minor difference in how Grace's maiden name is presented, both sentences convey the same overall meaning. They both provide information about Herbert Hepburn Calvert's birth, his parents, and his mother's maiden name.

Jill had hypertension, while her sister Beth had normal blood pressure. But I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases.

Analyzing the context: Robin is inviting Jesse on a camping trip, which indicates that they are likely friends or at least acquaintances. This suggests that Robin is trying to engage in a fun, social activity, and therefore would likely experience positive emotions associated with making plans and spending time together. 2. Analyzing the emotions: a) Scared: This emotion may occur if there were any threats or dangers associated with the camping trip, or if Robin were afraid of rejection or negative responses from Jesse. However, based on the context provided, there is no indication of any threats or fears involved. b) Free: This emotion may occur if Robin feels a sense of liberation or release after proposing the camping trip. As the activity involves spending time outdoors and away from daily life responsibilities, there is a possibility that Robin would feel free as a result of their invitation. c) Angry: This emotion may occur if there was a conflict or a negative encounter between Robin and Jesse. However, based on the context provided, there is no indication of any reason for anger. Considering each emotion and the context given, it is most likely that Robin would feel \\"free\\" after asking Jesse if they would like to leave on a camping day, as this corresponds with the positive emotions associated with engaging in an enjoyable activity with another person and the escapism from daily life that camping often provides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two men then begin poolside horseplay, one of them throwing the other one into the pool. the man who was thrown into the pool","completion":"Let's think step-by-step about what likely happens next: 1. The man who was thrown into the pool would resurface after hitting the water. The impact of being pushed into the pool would cause him to go briefly underwater before coming back up. Justification: When a person is thrown into a pool, especially during horseplay, it is natural for them to go underwater initially due to the force of the push and gravity pulling them down. 2. The man who was thrown into the pool would probably splash water around and react to the situation. He might either laugh or express surprise, depending on his personality and the context of their horseplay. Justification: People's reactions to being thrown into a pool can range from amusement to annoyance, but considering the two men were engaging in horseplay, a lighthearted reaction is more likely. 3. The wet man in the pool might decide to take revenge on his friend by attempting to pull him into the pool as well. This could be either through reaching out to grab his friend's arm or gesturing for him to join him in the pool. Justification: Good-natured horseplay often involves reciprocation, like taking turns in splashing water or trying to push one another into the pool. 4. As the horseplay continues, other people around the pool might join in or simply watch the action unfold. Some may laugh or cheer while others might prefer to keep their distance in order to avoid getting splashed. Justification: When a lively event like poolside horseplay occurs, it can either attract more people and deepen the excitement or deter others who are not interested in participating. So, the next events in the paragraph might read: \\"The man who was thrown into the pool resurfaced, laughter bubbling forth as he wiped water from his face. Seeing the grinning face of his friend who pushed him in, he reached out his hand to attempt to pull him into the pool as well. The playful commotion began to draw the attention of others around the pool, some cheering them on as others retreated to avoid the splashing water.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"yeah yes exactly um-hum i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave.\\" true?","completion":"To carefully analyze the premise and evaluate the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave,\\" let's break down the text and its key components. The speaker acknowledges that they know \\"how to behave such that there isn't\\" an invasion of their privacy. It suggests that the individual is aware of the social norms, standards, and expectations that are necessary to maintain their privacy. The speaker also alludes to the fact that if they were to \\"deviate from social norms of behavior,\\" such as running up and down the street yelling, their privacy will be invaded. This highlights the speaker's perceived consequences of deviating from expected behavior. Now, regarding the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave,\\" several factors need to be taken into consideration. 1. Awareness of Social Norms: The speaker seems to be aware of the social norms and the importance of adhering to these standards to maintain their privacy. This awareness could suggest that the individual generally understands how to behave appropriately within a societal context. 2. Variable Circumstances: The speaker states that they have thought about their behavior and the possible ramifications. However, it is essential to acknowledge that different situations may call for different behavioral responses. While the speaker seems confident in their ability to behave in a way that protects their privacy, it cannot be assumed that they will know how to behave in every situation they may face. 3. The Ability to Adapt: The hypothesis also doesn't account for the individual's ability to adapt to new or changing situations. As society evolves, so do its norms and expectations. A person's ability to alter their behavior in response to these changes is a critical aspect of knowing how to behave. 4. Personal Growth and Development: Another factor that may impact the truthfulness of the hypothesis is the speaker's ability to learn and grow over time. As an individual matures and engages in a variety of experiences, their understanding of social norms and appropriate behavior also evolves. Considering these factors and the premise's context, the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave\\" could be viewed as partially true. Although the speaker demonstrates an awareness of social norms and the consequences of deviating from them, it is important to recognize that situations vary and knowing how to behave in one instance does not guarantee appropriate behavior in every situation. Furthermore, understanding social norms is a continuous learning process, and the individual's ability to adapt, learn, and grow contributes significantly to their overall mastery of behavioral expectations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making pet treats, we'll take these simple steps that are easy to understand: 1. Choose the type of pet treats: First, decide if you want to make treats for a dog, cat, or another pet. Different pets have different tastes and dietary needs, so it's important to pick treats that will be tasty and healthy for your pet. 2. Find a recipe: Look for a pet treat recipe that is easy to follow and uses ingredients that are safe for your pet. You can find recipes online, in pet treat cookbooks, or even ask your veterinarian for recommendations. 3. Gather the ingredients: Once you have a recipe, make a list of all the ingredients you'll need. You might already have some of the ingredients at home, but you might need to visit a store to buy the rest. 4. Get your tools ready: Before starting, make sure you have all the tools you need, like bowls, spoons, cookie cutters, and a baking sheet. 5. Follow the recipe: Carefully read the recipe and follow the steps to prepare the pet treat dough. Make sure to mix the ingredients well and ask an adult for help if needed. 6. Shape the treats: Once the dough is ready, use cookie cutters or your hands to shape the treats into fun shapes that your pet will enjoy. 7. Bake or dry the treats: Some pet treats need to be baked in the oven, while others may need to be air-dried. Follow the instructions in the recipe to finish making the treats. 8. Let them cool: After the treats are done, let them cool down for a bit. This is important because hot treats can hurt your pet's mouth. 9. Store the treats: Once the treats are cool, put them in an airtight container to keep them fresh. You can store the container in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. 10. Enjoy: Finally, give your pet the tasty and healthy homemade treats you made, and watch them enjoy their special snack! Remember, if you are unsure about any ingredients or steps, you can always ask an adult for help or advice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Bryan C. Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.” Sacred...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Richard I (8 September 1157 - 6 April 1199) was King of England from 1189 until his death. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was known as Richard Coeur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior. Richard had already taken the cross as Count of Poitou in 1187. His father and Philip II had done so at Gisors on 21 January 1188 after receiving news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin. After Richard became king, he and Philip agreed to go on the Third Crusade, since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories. Richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross. He started to raise and equip a new crusader army. He spent most of his father's treasury (filled with money raised by the Saladin tithe), raised taxes, and even agreed to free King William I of Scotland from his oath of subservience to Richard in exchange for 10,000 marks. To raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions, lands, and other privileges to those interested in them. Those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts. William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and the King's Chancellor, made a show of bidding PS3,000 to remain as Chancellor. He was apparently outbid by a certain Reginald the Italian, but that bid was refused. Richard made some final arrangements on the continent. He reconfirmed his father's appointment of William Fitz Ralph to the important post of seneschal of Normandy. In Anjou, Stephen of Tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement. Payn de Rochefort, an Angevin knight, was elevated to the post of seneschal of Anjou. In Poitou the ex-provost of Benon, Peter Bertin, was made seneschal, and finally in Gascony the household official Helie de La Celle was picked for the seneschalship there. After repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his French possessions, Richard finally set out on the crusade in summer 1190. (His delay was criticised by troubadours such as Bertran de Born.) He appointed as regents Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex--who soon died and was replaced by Richard's chancellor William Longchamp. Richard's brother John was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against William. When Richard was raising funds for his crusade, he was said to declare, \\"I would have sold London if I could find a buyer\\". In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred I of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip and Tancred. Its main terms were: Joan was to receive 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold as compensation for her inheritance, which Tancred kept. Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, son of Geoffrey, as his heir, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age, giving a further 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold that would be returned by Richard if Arthur did not marry Tancred's daughter. The two kings stayed on in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip Augustus plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys (who had supposedly been the mistress of Richard's father Henry II). In April 1191 Richard left Messina for Acre, but a storm dispersed his large fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister Joan and his new fiancee Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, along with the wrecks of several other vessels, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos. On 1 May 1191 Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Lemesos (Limassol) on Cyprus. He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and treasure. Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol. Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time, in particular Guy of Lusignan. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival, Conrad of Montferrat. The local magnates abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. Isaac changed his mind, however, and tried to escape. Richard's troops, led by Guy de Lusignan, conquered the whole island by 1 June. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. Richard named Richard de Camville and Robert of Thornham as governors. He later sold the island to the master of Knights Templar, Robert de Sable, and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy of Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom. The rapid conquest of the island by Richard is more important than it may seem. The island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea. Cyprus remained a Christian stronghold until the battle of Lepanto (1571).

No; The statement \\"In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.\\" does not address the question about which type of spider has the most eyes. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: Most spiders possess eight eyes that are vital for their survival as they rely on them for sensory information, especially in terms of locating prey and detecting threats. However, some species might have fewer eyes, like the cave spiders (Meta menardi), which only have six eyes arranged in a U-shape pattern. The number of eyes does not necessarily indicate how well a spider can visually perceive its surroundings. For example, the jumping spider (Salticidae) family, which has eight eyes, has some of the best vision among spiders. Their anterior median eyes are particularly large and highly advanced, facilitating their ability to recognize suitable prey, potential mates, and other stimuli. In general, the number of eyes in spiders does not differ vastly between different species, but their arrangement, eye structure, and visual capabilities vary greatly. Consequently, it is not possible to pinpoint a specific spider type that has the \\"most eyes\\" as it is not a defining characteristic among spider varieties.

Answer the following question: Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen. He is trying see how temperature effects its deviations from ideality. He slowly increases the temperature of the oxygen and continues to measures its deviations. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will increasing the pressure cause the expected volume be more or less? Answer:","completion":"Given the scenario, Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen and is focusing on the effects of temperature on deviations from ideality. However, you asked about the effect of increasing pressure on the expected volume. In general, when dealing with gases, the Ideal Gas Law can be used as an approximation to describe their behavior. The Ideal Gas Law is represented by the equation PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. When pressure increases while keeping the number of moles of gas and the temperature constant (as it is in a sealed container), the expected volume will decrease according to the Ideal Gas Law. This is because, when pressure increases, the molecules of the gas are compressed into a smaller space, which reduces the volume occupied by the gas. However, real gases deviate from the behavior of an ideal gas as pressure and/or temperature change. This deviation can be quantified using the compressibility factor (Z), which is the ratio of the real molar volume to the ideal molar volume (Z = V_real / V_ideal). For real gases like oxygen, increasing the pressure may result in deviations from ideality, which could lead to an expected volume that is more or less than predicted by the Ideal Gas Law. The extent of deviation will depend on the specific gas and the conditions under which it is being measured. In the case of oxygen, for low to moderate pressure and high temperature, deviations from ideality are generally small. However, at high pressures and low temperatures, deviations may become more significant. In summary, increasing the pressure will generally cause the expected volume to be less according to the Ideal Gas Law. However, due to deviations from ideality, it is crucial to consider factors such as the specific gas being studied and the conditions under which the experiment is performed, as these factors may affect the real behavior of the gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

China Merchants Bank Co Ltd has teamed up with ride-hailing major Didi Kuaidi to provide automobile financing and expand its reach in China's booming mobile payment industry. The two have inked a comprehensive partnership, which includes a strategic investment by the former in the latter. Under the partnership, CMB will become the first bricks-and-mortar bank that can offer in-app credit card payments to Didi users. At present, users of Didi can only choose third-party payment solutions like WeChat Payment and Alipay to pay cab fares. Zhao Ju, vice-president of CMB, said the cooperation with Didi was an important step in its mobile Internet finance strategy. \\"CMB's mobile payment is going to enter a new chapter by leveraging Didi Kuaidi's vast user base,\\" he said. According to a report by China Internet Network Information Center earlier this month, Didi holds 87.2 percent of China's private car hailing market. The company said it has received 1.43 billion car-hailing requests on its platforms in 2015, which means 1.43 billion payments were made via smartphones. CMB is expected to use Didi to reach the core users of China's mobile payment market. Jean Liu, president of Didi, said many of the expats prefer payment by credit card rather than Alipay or WeChat. \\"The new partnership will help improve service quality and customer loyalty,\\" she said. The investment makes CMB part of Didi's existing investors, including Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and China Investment Corporation. Both of the companies declined to reveal the actual amount of the investment. Liu, who showed up on Tuesday for the first time in public after her treatment for breast cancer, said the cooperation with CMB is for the long run and \\"the capital investment is only part of it\\". Under the partnership, CMB and Didi will cooperate on a wide range of initiatives on financial services and online-to-offline cooperation. Apart from the in-app credit card payments, the two companies are going to launch joint credit cards in late February and automobile financing services for Didi's car owners. CMB's branches across China are expected to help Didi recruit more drivers. \\"There is a lot of room for imagination in our partnership,\\" Li said, adding in future people may use their CMB credit card reward points to pay for the ride on Didi. Li Chao, an analyst with iResearch Consulting Group, said the partnership may not significantly boost CMB's mobile payment business. \\"Didi has educated the market for three years and its customers have formed the habit of paying by WeChat or Alipay. So I think CMB can only turn a very smart proportion of Didi users into its payment customer,\\" he said. \\"But the move shows that China's traditional banking industry is finally thinking out of the box and looking for outside partners in Internet finance competition,\\" he said.

He threatens to sodomize her for not following his orders, he spanks her when he is mad at her and he gets off on dominating her. He finally does sodomize her until she passes out...sorry, none of that is my idea of a loving relationship.

Premise: Mohammed Ali had a vision for his new domain. Hypothesis: Mohammed Ali flew by the seat of his pants. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the terms used in the premise and the hypothesis. - A vision refers to a clear idea or plan for achieving a certain goal. - Flying by the seat of one's pants means making decisions or taking actions based on instinct or intuition rather than following a well-defined plan. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. - The premise states that Mohammed Ali had a vision for his new domain, meaning he had a plan or strategy in mind. - The hypothesis suggests that Mohammed Ali relied on instinct or intuition instead of following a clear plan. Step 3: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis. - The premise and hypothesis seem to contradict each other. Having a vision usually implies that there is some degree of planning or strategic thought, while flying by the seat of one's pants implies an absence of a plan and reliance on instincts.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is Iain Duncan Smith. Iain Duncan Smith is a British Conservative Party politician who serves as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chingford and Woodford Green, a constituency located in Greater London. He was first elected as MP for the area in 1992, and he has held the seat ever since. Iain Duncan Smith, full name George Iain Duncan Smith, was born on April 9, 1954, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and later pursued a military career, serving in the Scots Guards from 1975 to 1981. After leaving the military, he worked in various business roles before entering politics. In 1997, Iain Duncan Smith was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Social Security, and in September 2001, following the Conservatives' failure to win the general election, he became the leader of the Conservative Party. He replaced William Hague as the new party leader, beating Kenneth Clarke in the leadership election. Under his tenure as party leader, Iain Duncan Smith faced several challenges, including internal disputes and disagreements within the party. His leadership faced widespread criticism from his party as well as the media, ultimately resulting in a vote of no confidence by Conservative MPs in October 2003, which led to his resignation as party leader. He was succeeded by Michael Howard. After stepping down from the leadership, Iain Duncan Smith remained active in British politics, focusing on various social issues. In 2004, he founded the Centre for Social Justice, a think tank focused on addressing social problems in the United Kingdom. When the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to power in 2010, Iain Duncan Smith was appointed the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, a role he held until March 2016 when he resigned over proposed changes to the welfare system. In recent years, he has continued to serve as a backbench MP and has been outspoken on a range of issues, including Brexit and the UK's relationship with the European Union. In summary, Iain Duncan Smith is the former Conservative Party leader who is currently serving as the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green.

US Internet speeds lag many in Asia, Europe Cambridge-based Akamai Technologies recently issued it State of the Internet report, based on information about trillions of data transfers. Despite ambitious plans by private companies and governments to boost the adoption of broadband technology, the average Internet connection speed in the United States is still slower than those of many other countries. Cambridge-based Akamai’s latest State of the Internet report found the average US connection speed to be 11.7 megabits per second last quarter, about half the speed of top-ranked South Korea. Akamai, which helps Web companies boost their loading speeds by distributing Web files to locations that are closer to end users, compiled the information from the trillions of data transfers its network makes every quarter. The United States ranked 16th in terms of average Internet speeds, behind the United Kingdom and ahead of Canada. In addition to South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore had higher average speeds, as did Israel and a number of Northern Europe countries. Speeds in the United States barely budged in the last year, rising slightly from an average of 11.4 Mbps, past Akamai reports show. And eight months after the Federal Communications Commission increased the standard for broadband download speeds to 25 Mbps from 4 Mbps, no state’s average was that fast. In five places, at least 10 percent of connections met that benchmark:the District of Columbia, Delaware, Utah, Washington, and Massachusetts. A fourth of South Korean connections hit that benchmark, and the figure was around 16 percent in second-ranked Hong Kong. There are many ways to measure Internet speeds. Download speeds are often faster than upload speeds, peak speeds are different from average speeds, and including mobile connections can skew the metrics. Netflix reports how fast it delivers movies and TV shows to different groups of customers, while the company Ookla reports results from its website Speedtest.net. The federal government has its own standard. Among states, Akamai said, Massachusetts connections were the third-fastest, averaging 15.3 Mbps. At the top was Washington, D.C., with average connection speeds of 19 Mbps, while Delaware was second, averaging 16.7 Mbps. Compared to those in much of the world, US connection speeds are relatively fast, topping every other country in the Americas. The global average was 5.1 Mbps, less than half of the US average, but 17 percent higher than it was last year.

Article: Inland waters may be grouped into two general classes: standing waters and flowing waters. As is often the case, the boundary between these two classes is not sharp and clear. A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \\"lakes\\" disappear completely during each dry season. Standing waters vary from very shallow to very deep, from clear to muddy, from fresh to salty. In flowing waters we roughly distinguish between brooks, creeks, and rivers. The size and age of flowing waters are unimportant. Speed of flow, clearness, oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics are used by scientists in studying flowing-water ecosystems.

Question: Information: - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Island Records is a Jamaican-English record label that operates as a division of the Universal Music Group (UMG). It was founded by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959. Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. Both Island and another label recently acquired byPolyGram, A&M Records, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s. - Cold Chillin' Records was a record label that released some music in the golden age of hip hop from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. A producer-and-crew label founded by manager Tyrone Williams and run by Len Fichtelberg (d. November 4, 2010), most of the label's releases were by members of the Juice Crew, a loosely knit group of artists centered on producer Marley Marl. In 1998, the label shut down and the majority of its expansive catalog was bought by Massachusetts-based LandSpeed Records (now Traffic Entertainment). - Hip hop is a subcultural art movement that was formed during the early 1970s primarily by African-American and Afro Puerto Rican youths residing in the South Bronx in New York City. Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify. - \`\` Mother Mother '' is a song by Tracy Bonham from her debut album The Burdens of Being Upright .

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

The flour will help the stew become thicker as it cooks. 2. Cornstarch: Another option is using cornstarch. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water. This will make a slurry. Slowly pour this slurry into the stew while stirring. This will also make the stew thicker. 3. Cook longer: You can also let the stew cook for a longer time. As it cooks, some of the liquid will evaporate, making the stew thicker. Make sure to keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pot.

Help as much as you can. I was a student nurse at the time. I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Question: Who, of the artists whose death years are mentioned in the passage, did not live to see the 1450s? Context: The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images.

Given these facts, what can be water vapor condensing in air be a hindrance to among the following options: - eating - driving - survival - rain - movement - farming - vehicles - cooking A:","completion":"Among the given options, water vapor condensing in the air, leading to fog, can typically be a hindrance to driving, movement, farming, and vehicles. 1. Driving: Fog poses a significant danger while driving, as it severely reduces visibility for drivers. Poor visibility can lead to slower reaction times and an increased likelihood of collisions. Drivers need to be extremely cautious during foggy conditions, using their fog lights and low-beam headlights to improve visibility, while also decreasing their speed to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Hazards on the road may also be harder to perceive, further increasing the risk of accidents. 2. Movement: Reduced visibility caused by fog can impact any mode of transport, including walking, cycling, and even aviation. Limited sight can create difficulties in determining one's location, direction, and distance from obstacles. Navigating in foggy conditions requires added caution, as it is easier to miss signs, landmarks, and other crucial navigational aids. Moreover, fog hampers the detection of approaching vehicles or pedestrians, increasing the risk of accidents. 3. Farming: Excessive or long-lasting fog can have detrimental effects on farming, particularly in terms of sunlight availability. Many crops rely on an adequate amount of sunlight for photosynthesis, which is crucial for their growth and development. Extended periods of fog can block sunlight and reduce solar radiation, which may lead to decreased crop yields. Additionally, high humidity levels during foggy conditions can promote the growth of fungal diseases, further affecting the health of crops and decreasing their productivity. 4. Vehicles: Foggy conditions can affect the overall performance of vehicles, especially when visibility is severely limited. During fog, condensation can form on vehicle windows and mirrors, reducing the driver's ability to see surrounding traffic and potential hazards. External sensors on vehicles, such as rearview cameras and proximity sensors used for parking, may become obstructed by fog, rendering these safety features less effective. Moreover, fog can lead to the accumulation of moisture in sensitive areas of vehicles like the engine and electrical components, potentially causing malfunctions and increasing the risk of accidents. Overall, water vapor condensing in the air and the formation of fog can pose challenges for people in various activities, with the primary hindrance being the significant reduction in visibility. This reduction in visibility makes driving, movement, farming, and vehicles more challenging or dangerous, making caution and preparedness essential when dealing with foggy conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Orestis Makris ( Greek : ; September 30 , 1898 -- January 29 , 1975 ) was a Greek actor and tenor . He graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and first entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925 . He later joined the Papaioannou troupe , before moving to more comedic roles . Makris excelled in the portrayal of folk characters , especially the stock role of the \`\` drunkard '' . Makris also participated in about forty movies , mostly as an over-strict father . He is considered one of the most significant modern Greek actors . He was decorated with the Order of the Phoenix . He died on January 29 , 1975 in Athens and is buried at the First Cemetery in a family grave . - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Spinto (from Italian, \\"pushed\\") is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms \\"lirico-spinto\\" or \\"jugendlich-dramatisch\\" are used to denote this category of voice.) - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\". What is the relationship between 'orestis makris' and 'opera'?","completion":"Orestis Makris was a Greek actor and tenor, known for his significant contributions to Greek theater and cinema.

As a tenor, he participated in opera and classical singing performances. Later, he transitioned to more comedic roles in theater and cinema, where he excelled in portraying folk characters.

What animal normally represents the box of low market share and low market growth in the Boston Matrix (or 'BSG Matrix' or 'Growth-Share Matrix') marketing model?","completion":"The Boston Matrix, also known as the BCG Matrix or Growth-Share Matrix, is a marketing model developed by the Boston Consulting Group in the early 1970s. It is a strategic analysis tool that helps businesses evaluate the performance and potential of their products or services by categorizing them into four different quadrants based on their market share and market growth. In the Boston Matrix, animals are often used as symbols to represent these quadrants, and the animal that normally represents the box of low market share and low market growth is the \\"Dog.\\" Below is a detailed explanation of the Boston Matrix and its four quadrants: 1. Stars (High Market Share, High Market Growth) These are products or services that have a high market share in a steadily growing segment. They generate significant revenue and are considered leaders in their market. Companies should invest in these products or services to maintain or even increase market dominance. 2. Cash Cows (High Market Share, Low Market Growth) These products or services have a high market share in a mature, slow-growing industry. They generate substantial cash flow but have low growth potential. Companies should focus on maintaining their market share and extracting profits from these products or services. 3. Question Marks (Low Market Share, High Market Growth) These products or services have low market share in a fast-growing market. They have potential for growth and can possibly become Stars or Cash Cows in the future, but they also require significant investment. Companies need to carefully analyze these products or services and decide whether to invest in them or reallocate resources elsewhere. 4. Dogs (Low Market Share, Low Market Growth) These are the products or services that have a low market share in a stagnant or declining market segment. \\"Dogs\\" typically generate low revenue and have limited potential for growth. Companies should carefully evaluate the performance of these products or services and consider divesting or phasing them out if they are not generating significant profits or contributing positively to the business. In summary, the \\"Dog\\" quadrant represents products or services with low market share and low market growth in the Boston Matrix. These products or services are not significant contributors to a business's overall growth or profitability and often require careful evaluation and strategic decision-making to either eliminate or turn them around."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this step-by-step. 1. Fact 1 states that a gasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into motion. This implies that the primary function of a gasoline lawn mower is to transform the chemical energy stored in gasoline into the mechanical energy needed to power the lawn mower's motor and enable movement. 2. Fact 2 states that movement is thought in motion. While this statement is somewhat abstract, it implies that movement can be considered a representation of the transfer of energy from one form to another (in this case, from gasoline to motion). Considering these facts, it can be deduced that a gasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into movement, as it transforms the stored chemical energy into mechanical energy that powers the motor and allows the lawn mower to move."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Lamberts were the principals in a distinguished Madison Avenue jewelry house and were prominent college football boosters.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

This is the subject of my sentence and it will be introduced first. Step 3: I have to give details about this restaurant. The next information I have is the 'eatType' - it's a pub. I've seen that 'eatType' refers to the type of establishment. It's also typical in English to follow the introduction of a business's name with the kind of business it is, adding this immediately after the name. Step 4: A predicate to the subject is that it's family-friendly. I need to incorporate this piece of information as part of the main characteristics of the subject (pub), as this attribute would be a decisive factor for the target customers. Step 5: The next detail to give is the customer rating. It helps to add legitimacy and reputation to the business. Putting this towards the middle to end of the sentence can ensure that the information flow is smooth, easing the reader into this bit of potentially perplexing data. Step 6: The last component is the location of the restaurant - near the Ranch. Location is a crucial detail when describing a business.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: tin foil","completion":"To determine which solution is best for using tin foil, we must first understand the goal or application for which the tin foil will be used. Tin foil, also commonly referred to as aluminum foil, is a thin, pliable sheet of aluminum that has a wide range of uses in both domestic and industrial settings. Let's consider various options and applications to help you choose the best solution for your specific goal: 1. Food Packaging and Preservation: Aluminum foil is an excellent choice for various food packaging and preservation purposes. Its ability to form a barrier against light, oxygen, moisture, and microorganisms makes it ideal for wrapping and preserving food items. As a result, a 1) heavy-duty aluminum foil with a thickness between 16 and 24 microns is recommended for effectively protecting and preserving different types of food. 2. Cooking: Tin foil can be used in cooking techniques such as baking, grilling, and steaming. For example, wrapping food items in foil before cooking can help maintain moisture and flavor while reducing cooking time. In this case, 2) a standard aluminum foil with a thickness of approximately 12 to 16 microns should suffice, as it can withstand the heat and force required for various cooking methods. 3. Heat Insulation and Reflectivity: If the goal is to use the tin foil for its heat insulation and reflectivity properties, such as creating a solar oven or an insulated container, then 3) aluminum foil with a reflective side (which typically has a shiny finish) would work best. This foil variant can reflect up to 95% of the sunlight and help maintain a consistent internal temperature. 4. Art and Craft Purposes: Aluminum foil is widely used for various art and craft projects due to its flexibility and ease of manipulation. If your goal is to use the tin foil for artistic or creative purposes, then a 4) colored or embossed aluminum foil can add an aesthetic appeal to your project. These foils can come in various thicknesses depending on the intricacy and structural requirements of your artwork. 5. Industrial Uses: In certain industrial applications like manufacturing, insulation, or electronics, the use of tin foil might require specific properties like electrical conductivity, higher thickness levels, or added chemical resistance. In these cases, a 5) specialized aluminum foil tailored for the specific industry's requirements will be the best choice. Consult with an expert in the field to determine the most suitable foil type for your needs. Depending on the intended use of the tin foil, one of these solutions will be better than the others for your goal. Assess the requirements and applications of your project, and choose the appropriate aluminum foil solution accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:","completion":"Title: Lady Says Sorry for Hurting Little Boy with a Knife Once upon a time, in a quiet street, lived a woman and a little boy of eight years old. They lived close to each other but they know each other very well. One very sad day, the woman did something very bad. She hurt the little boy. It was so bad that she even used a knife, which made a small hole in the boy's skin. None of us should ever hurt another person. It's like when you accidentally push your friend during playtime and they fall down. That's not nice, right? This woman did something much worse. The neighbors, those are the people who also live in the same street, saw this and became very worried. When grownups see something bad, they know they have to tell someone who can make things right. Just like how, when you see someone being mean at school, you tell your teacher, right? Similarly, the lady's neighbor informed the police about what she had done. The police are like grown-ups for grown-ups. They make sure everyone is safe and are not being hurt by anyone, just like your parents or teachers who look out for you. Hence, after hearing this, the police took matters into their hands. When the woman was asked about it, she admitted, which means she accepted that she did hurt the little boy with a knife. Sometimes grown-ups make mistakes too, just like little kids, but they also must say sorry and try to be better. This story is a reminder of how important it is to be kind, not hurt others, and if we do something wrong, we need to say sorry and try to be better next time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prepare the cleaning supplies: Gather all your cleaning supplies, such as a vacuum cleaner, cleaning cloths, floor cleaner, window cleaner, a broom, and a mop. Making a list of the rooms and the necessary supplies for each helps in streamlining your cleaning process. 2. Start from the top: Begin your cleaning routine with high, hard-to-reach areas like ceiling fans, shelves, and light fixtures. Use a long-handled duster or a dusting brush with an extension pole to dust these areas. This ensures that dust or debris from higher places doesn't settle on newly cleaned lower surfaces. 3. Dust off the furniture: Wipe all the furniture, including tables, chairs, and bookshelves, using a microfiber cloth to remove dust and dirt. 4. Clean the windows: Spray window cleaner onto the windows and wipe them down with a clean cloth, ensuring no streaks are left behind. This should be done for all the windows in the house, including those in your parents' room, which you have already opened for ventilation. 5. Vacuum the floors: Vacuum carpets and rugs thoroughly, taking care to vacuum underneath furniture and in corners. Use the vacuum's brush attachment for baseboards and other hard-to-reach areas. 6. Sweep and mop hard floors: After vacuuming, sweep the hard floors using a broom and dustpan, ensuring all debris is collected. Following this, mop the floors using an appropriate cleaning solution and allow the floors to dry. 7. Deep clean the kitchen: Wipe down countertops, appliances, and the stovetop. Clean the insides of cabinets and drawers, as well as the refrigerator. Disinfect the sink and clean the faucet. Sweep and mop the kitchen floor. 8. Tackle the bathroom: Scrub the toilet, sink, and bathtub or shower using bathroom-specific cleaning products. Clean the bathroom mirrors and wipe down all other surfaces, including countertops and shelves. Sweep and mop the bathroom floor. 9. Organize personal items: Put away any items that are out of place, such as clothes, shoes, or books. Make sure all personal belongings are properly stored in their designated places to give your house a neat and organized appearance. 10. Take care of the trash: Empty all trash cans throughout the house and replace the liners. Ensure that all garbage is appropriately disposed of, and recycling items are placed in the correct bins. 11. Add final touches: Re-arrange any throw pillows or decorative items to add flair to your cleaned home, and place fresh flowers or plants strategically around the house to give it a lively and inviting atmosphere. 12.

While the other options, such as casino (B), theatre (C), show (D), and comedy (E), might be related to screen-based entertainment, they have some limitations compared to movies. For instance: B. Casino - Casinos are generally places where people go for gambling, and although they might have screens for virtual games or monitoring purposes, they are not primarily associated with entertainment on a screen. C. Theatre - Theatre is a more traditional form of entertainment involving live performances, primarily witnessed in-person. While there are cases where theatre performances are recorded or adapted into movies, the primary experience of theatre is not screen-based. D. Show - A show, including TV shows, series, or talk shows, can be considered screen-based entertainment.

Here is a news article: Karl Martin’s toothbrush holder. Courtesy Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers Ltd During the Bronze Age, around 4,000 years ago, in what is now Afghanistan, an artisan from the Indus Valley (or Harappan) civilization made a ceramic pot. The four-inch-tall vessel was distinguished by a doe-eyed antelope painted across its flank. We’ll never know who used it, or for what—at least before 2013. That’s when Karl Martin, a valuer at Hansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire, England, purchased the pot at a car boot sale, a kind of English flea market. And why not? He got it and another pot for a total of £4—or, £1 for every thousand years since it had been made. Of course Martin didn’t know at the time that he was buying an authentic artifact from one of the cradles of civilization. All he knew, he said in a Hansons release, was that he “liked it straight away,” so he gave it a place of honor in his household where he would see it every day. It was in the bathroom, where it held his toothbrush and toothpaste. There it sat for years. And there it would have stayed, if not for the fact that Martin often encounters antiquities in his line of work. One day, he was helping a Hansons colleague unload some items headed for the block when he spotted some familiar-looking pottery, coated with patterns and animals like those on his toothbrush-holder. He brought his holder to the colleague, James-Seymour Brenchley, Hansons’ Head of Ancient Art, Antiquities & Classical Coins. Brenchley was able to link the pot’s painting style to that of other Indus Valley artifacts. He speculates that the pot had arrived in the United Kingdom via British tourists. Martin decided to put it up for auction at Hansons, where it sold this week for £80—“not a fortune,” Martin admits, but still a 1,900 percent profit, not adjusting for inflation. Mohenjo-Daro, a major Indus Valley city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Quratulain/CC BY-SA 3.0 The Indus Valley Civilization flourished in the northwestern part of South Asia between 2600 and 1900 BC, across parts of modern-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Its most distinctive artifacts are probably carved seals used to mark trade goods with symbols that may or may not represent one of mankind’s earliest written languages. (The Indus script is the subject of much heated scholarly debate.) But the Indus Valley pot is not the only antiquated item in the United Kingdom that had been unintentionally repurposed for modern times. Earlier this week, researchers realized that Henry VII’s unidentified bed was used to decorate film and television sets between the 1970s and 1990s. That’s at least two items for a first-class master bedroom suite. ||||| A piece of pottery snapped up for a song at a Midlands car boot sale has turned out to be a genuine ancient antiquity made in 1900 BC – making it 4,000 years old. The pottery jar, featuring a painting of an antelope, was spotted on a stall at Willington car boot sale five years ago by Derby man Karl Martin – and he bought it along with another pot, £4 for the pair. “I liked it straight away,” said Mr Martin, 49, a keen collector who followed his passion for all things old, quirky and collectable by joining the team at Derbyshire’s Hansons Auctioneers seven years ago. “I used it in the bathroom to store my toothpaste and toothbrush – it even ended up getting a few toothpaste marks on it. “I suspected it might be very old but forgot all about it.Then, one day at work, I was helping Hansons’ antiquities expert James Brenchley unload a van and noticed some pottery which was similar to my toothbrush pot. The painting style looked the same and it had similar crudely-painted animal figures. “I rescued the pot from my bathroom and asked him to examine it for me. He confirmed it was a genuine antiquity from Afghanistan and dated back to 1900 BC. “That means it’s around 4,000 years old – made 2,000 years before Christ was born. It’s amazing, really. How it ended up at a South Derbyshire car boot sale, I’ll never know. “I like the pot but decided to sell it at Hansons’ November antiquities auction just to see how it would do. There was interest straight away with advance bids placed and it eventually sold for £80 – not a fortune but a decent profit. Perhaps I should have held on to it. I feel a bit guilty about keeping my toothbrush in it now.” James Brenchley, head of antiquities at Hansons Auctioneers, said: “This is an Indus Valley Harappan Civilisation pottery jar dating back to 1900 BC. This was a Bronze Age civilisation mainly in the north western regions of South Asia. “Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early cradles of civilisations of the Old World, and of the three, the most widespread. The civilisation was primarily located in modern-day India and Pakistan as well as Afghanistan.” “I do come across items like this from time to time and was familiar with the painting technique. It was probably brought back to the UK years ago by wealthy travellers.” The pottery was sold at Hansons Auctioneers on November 26. Entries are now invited for its next Antiquities and Historica Auction on February 25.

I'll explain the answers to both of your questions one by one and then compare them. Question 1: RT News, which stands for Russia Today News, is a news channel that sometimes presents news or stories with a different perspective than other news channels. Some people believe that they have a tendency to talk about or support conspiracy theories more often.

What are the pros and cons of swimming in underwear?","completion":"No, these two questions are not the same. They address different topics and contexts. I'll provide detailed answers for both questions: 1. Why didn't Horace Slughorn edit the potions recipes like Snape? To understand why Horace Slughorn did not edit the potions recipes like Snape, it is essential to consider their characters and roles in the Harry Potter series. Horace Slughorn is the Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House for part of the series. He is known for his love of comfort, his selective associations with people he considers influential or talented, and his adherence to tradition. Slughorn follows potions recipes strictly, as they are presented in textbooks, and he values their established nature. He could also be motivated by the intent not to confuse students with an alternative approach to the potions-making process. On the other hand, Severus Snape, another Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House, is more innovative and experimental in his methods. In his student years, Snape made modifications to the potions recipes by adjusting the ingredients, quantities, or process in a way that improved the outcomes. He documented these changes in his old potions textbook, and Harry would later rely on these modifications. Snape's approach to potions suggests he valued skill and mastery beyond simply adhering to the instructions. In summary, Horace Slughorn did not edit the potions recipes like Snape due to differences in their characters, their approaches to potions-making, and their adherence to tradition versus the pursuit of mastery. 2. What are the pros and cons of swimming in underwear? Pros: - Accessibility: Swimming in underwear can be more immediately accessible, especially in a spontaneous situation where swimwear isn't available. - Comfort: Some people may find their underwear more comfortable than swimwear, as they are generally designed for everyday wear and fit. - Cost efficiency: If you do not have a bathing suit or do not want to invest in one, underwear can be a cost-effective alternative. - Less restrictive: Underwear can provide a feeling of freedom and reduced restriction, especially in comparison to tight, form-fitting swimwear. Cons: - Hygiene: Swimming in underwear can raise hygiene concerns, particularly in public pools, where there may be restrictions on proper swimwear to minimize bacterial contamination. - Ill-suited fabric: Most underwear is made from materials that were not designed for swimming, such as cotton, which retains water and takes longer to dry than swimwear fabrics. - Transparency: Wet underwear might become partially transparent. This could make you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious, especially in a public setting. - Durability: Regular underwear is not meant for swimming and may wear out or degrade more quickly due to the exposure to water and the chlorine or minerals found in swimming pools or other bodies of water. - Social norms: Swimming in underwear might be viewed as inappropriate or disrespectful in some environments, such as public pools or beaches, due to cultural norms and expectations. In summary, while swimming in underwear can offer certain benefits like accessibility, comfort, and being less restrictive, it may raise hygiene concerns, be ill-suited for swimming, lead to transparency and durability issues, and potentially violate social norms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How many Armenians were slaughtered between 1894-1896 Answer: While Western Armenia still remained under Ottoman rule, the Armenians were granted considerable autonomy within their own enclaves and lived in relative harmony with other groups in the empire (including the ruling Turks). Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"No, the question was not answered in a satisfactory fashion. Allow me to provide a more accurate and detailed response. The events that took place between 1894-1896, often referred to as the Hamidian massacres, were a series of government-sanctioned mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire carried out under the rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The exact number of the Armenian deaths during this period is subject to some debate, but the historically accepted estimates range between 100,000 and 300,000. There are several factors that contribute to the wide range in numbers: 1. Lack of accurate official records: During that period, official records from the Ottoman government are limited, and what does exist is often either not detailed enough or biased. Therefore, many historians and scholars rely on reports from other sources, like foreign diplomats and missionaries, to base their estimates on. 2. Discrepancies in contemporary accounts: During the time of these massacres, the international press, missionaries, and foreign diplomats were reporting wildly different figures, depending on their political leanings and affiliations. Some exaggerated the mortality rates to create more sympathy for the Armenian cause, while others downplayed the numbers to avoid international condemnation of the Ottoman Empire. 3. Definition of \\"slaughtered\\": The term \\"slaughtered\\" can include not only those directly killed but also those who perished due to indirect causes like starvation, disease, and exposure, resulting from displacement and deprivation of resources. This broader interpretation of the term leads to higher mortality figures. Taking these factors into account, most historians and scholars agree that at least 100,000 Armenians were killed during the Hamidian massacres between 1894-1896, but the numbers possibly go up to 300,000. It is crucial to emphasize that the estimates are subject to interpretation, and discrepancies in contemporary accounts make it challenging to pinpoint a specific number definitively.

I went to unlock the door and found my key wouldn't go in. I kept trying while my daughter went to get a flashlight. When she returned with it we found somehow the lock had been \\"stuffed\\" with sunflower seed shells. Thinking that one of the neighborhood children had been up to no good, I really didn't give it much consideration. I found all windows were locked up tight. So I returned to the back door. Oh my God, I will never forget the shock of that moment. The house was empty! Other than a few things remaining on the back porch, everything was gone! Then I heard a car pull into the driveway and found two policemen walking up. They inquired why I had broken into the house. They then asked me for proof that I lived at that address, so I asked them to wait a minute while I went to get my rent receipt and identification from inside the house. I explained the matter to them and showed them the door lock. I could tell from their actions and tone of voice that they thought I was breaking into an empty house for somewhere to sleep. I asked a neighbor for the phone number of house owner and the officer made a call. The owner was quite shocked to hear my story. She said that my roommate had been going through an eviction process with the court when I moved in with her and had lost the case. She had been ordered to move by 10 am on that date. The court order had been issued the same day I had paid her 1/2 of the rent and a deposit of 300,000. The owner was very kind and understanding but there was nothing she could do.

Designed for use in premium economy and business class, at the flick of a switch, the seat can be transformed from single upright seat, to four-foot 'couch' and even into a full length double bed. It will allow young passengers in premium economy to lie flat, and will stagger seating to avoid the dreaded elbow clash - a very common complaint on long-haul flights. Hong Kong designer James SH Lee of Paperclip Design, came up with the concept, named Butterfly seating, which recently one first prize at IATA's 2014 Passenger Innovation Awards. A business class seat in upright mode. Passengers get a spacious private suite with a seat plus a side couch and direct aisle access. The idea of Butterfly seating is to allow for individual demand of the cabin on each individual flight - despite the limited space on an aircraft. While only the business class passengers will be able to transform their seats into a full length bed, this is the first time that premium economy travellers will have access to a 'couch' allowing younger passengers the chance to sleep more comfortably. Lee told MailOnline Travel: 'This flexibility allows airlines to make use of resource more efficiently so that the cost is lowered. The layout maximises bed space, with the sleeping surface utilizing nearly every inch of available floor area. 'They can also react to fluctuations much quicker than before, making them much more resilient to the risks of changing market conditions.' 'For passengers this equates to more stable fares long term, and the flexibility means more options for them. 'In the past if the business class cabin is full, then it's sold out. But with butterfly they can turn some premium economy seats into business class, and vice versa, if there's a need. At 53cm, the seating will be as wide as many current business class seats in a 777 sized cabin. Fliers in business class can transform the seat into a large bed, accommodating various sleeping positions. In premium economy, young passengers will be able to lie flat as their seat can be transformed into a 'couch' The seats will also feature large cocktail trays, seat pockets on the side and an adjustable ottoman. Meanwhile, passengers in business class will be able to transform the seat into one of the largest bed surfaces currently available. At 195.6cm long from top-to-toe, the seat becomes a private suite including a side couch. A graphic shows the conversion from premium economy to business class. A mechanism that allows flight attendants to flip the window seat over, turning it into a couch. Passengers in Business Class will be able be offered one of the largest surfaces currently available. The designer added: 'Academic research on convertible seating used in European short haul flights shows a 3.3 per cent increase in revenue, which is hugely significant for the airline industry which makes a net profit between zero to four per cent globally.' 'Butterfly helps to extend this benefit to long haul markets,' he said.

They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina. - Spirula spirula is a species of deep-water squid-like cephalopod mollusk. It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it is commonly known as the ram's horn squid or the little post horn squid. Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid. - Permoceras , the sole member of the Permoceratidae , is a coiled nautiloid with a smooth , compressed involute shell , whorls higher than wide , earlier whorls hidden from view . The venter is rounded as are the ventral and umbilical shoulders , the flanks flattened . The siphuncle is ventrally subcentral . The suture , which is most characteristic , has a deep , narrow pointed ventral lobe and large , asymmetrical pointed lobes on either side . Permoceras is included in the nautilid superfamily , Trigonocerataceae , and is derived from the Mississippian ( L Carb ) - Triassic Grypoceratidae . Permoceras was first identified in the Lower Permian of Timur in the East Indies and named by Miller and Collinson in 1953 Permoceras almost precisely resembles Pseudonautilus from the Upper Jurassic . - Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs. - The siphuncle is a strand of tissue passing longitudinally through the shell of a cephalopod mollusk. Only cephalopods with chambered shells have siphuncles, such as the extinct ammonites and belemnites, and the living nautiluses, cuttlefish, and \\"Spirula\\". In the case of the cuttlefish, the siphuncle is indistinct and connects all the small chambers of that animal's highly modified shell; in the other cephalopods it is thread-like and passes through small openings in the walls dividing the chambers. - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot.

As they grow closer during their hostile confrontations, they are forced to confront their feelings for each other amidst a world full of deceit, rivalries, and danger. The movie begins with Farrell (played by a popular Hollywood actor), a skilled undercover agent, receiving his new assignment to infiltrate the criminal empire of Gilda (played by a renowned actress), a feared and mysterious figure in the city. Gilda runs her business with an iron fist and is known to be ruthless towards anyone who dares to defy or deceive her. The authorities believe that she has a significant role in human trafficking, arms dealing, and various other criminal activities. Farrell's mission is to collect concrete evidence and bring down her empire. Farrell's journey starts by working his way up in the underground criminal world, gaining trust, and gaining access to Gilda's inner circle. As he gets closer to her, he begins to discover that Gilda is not the cold, heartless criminal everyone thinks she is. There's another side to her - one that is scarred by a dark past and a series of personal losses. Farrell finds it hard to maintain a facade as he too begins to empathize with Gilda's position. One night, as they both attend a lavish party hosted by Gilda, an unknown group of assassins attacks Gilda's headquarters. Farrell, in the heat of the moment, saves Gilda from the assassins and ends up killing some of them in the process. This act changes the dynamics of their relationship, bringing them closer as the walls between them start to crumble. A connection forms between them, but they are still bound by their roles as enemies. As Farrell continues his mission, he uncovers that there is a mole in Gilda's organization who is also trying to bring her down. This discovery raises the stakes as Farrell slowly unearths several layers of deceit not only in Gilda's world but also within his own agency. To complicate matters further, they find themselves caught in a struggle amidst rival crime syndicates which take notice of their growing power. With tensions rising, Farrell and Gilda are faced with their most hostile confrontation yet, in a secret and dangerous location where their lives hang in the balance. As they passionately argue and physically struggle against each other, the conflict reaches a boiling point, and their suppressed emotions come to the surface. In an unexpected moment, Farrell whispers Gilda's name and they find themselves passionately kissing, finally surrendering to the feelings they could no longer deny. There is no turning back now as Farrell and Gilda must choose between their loyalties and their love. Facing insurmountable odds like betrayal from their closest allies, attempts on their lives, and rival gangs looking to devour their empire, they decide to work together against the forces that wish to tear them apart. In a final showdown of breathtaking action, they manage to eliminate the most powerful threats to their love and freedom. Ultimately, with collected evidence in hand and a shared determination to right their wrongs, Farrell turns Gilda over to the authorities with her full cooperation for a reduced sentence. Epilogue: Several years later, Gilda is released from prison and finds a changed world. She is unsure of her place in this new reality when she sees a figure waiting for her outside the prison gates - Farrell. He believes in the second chance they have been granted, and as they embrace each other, together, they walk into an uncertain but hopeful future. \\"Crossing Fates\\" is a spellbinding romantic drama with action-packed sequences that unravel a twisted web of deception, betrayal, and reluctant love between two complex characters bound by circumstances and destiny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a news article: Alaska State Troopers say a Swiss woman who was trying to wade across a swollen Alaska river to see an abandoned bus made famous in the movie \\"Into the Wild\\" has drowned. Troopers say 29-year-old Claire Jane Ackermann attempted to cross the Teklanika River with a 27-year-old man from France on Saturday when they lost their footing and were pulled under by the current, according to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. The man survived. The old Fairbanks city bus was where 24-year-old Chris McCandless camped out and starved to death in 1992. It has become a destination for adventurers. The 2007 movie was an adaptation of the Jon Krakauer book about McCandless, who began wandering across the country after college. ||||| Swiss woman drowns in Teklanika River, near 'Into the Wild' bus FAIRBANKS — The fact that a 29-year-old Swiss woman drowned Saturday while attempting to cross the Teklanika River on the Stampede Trail doesn’t surprise Jon Nierenberg.What surprises him is that it didn’t happen to someone a lot sooner.Nierenberg, who owns a lodge four miles from the end of Stampede Road, said it was just a matter of time before someone drowned trying to cross the river to reach the old Fairbanks city bus made famous in the movie “Into the Wild.”Since the critically acclaimed film was released three years ago, the bus where 24-year-old Chris McCandless starved to death in 1992 has become a destination for adventurers following in McCandless’ footsteps.“Honestly, I’m amazed this hasn’t happened earlier,” Nierenberg said Monday by phone.Whether or not backpacker Claire Jane Ackermann was on her way to the bus is not known, but Nierenberg said practically everyone who hikes the Stampede Trail has the same destination in mind.“It’s not a casual place to go hiking,” Nierenberg said. “I have absolutely no doubt what she was doing out there.”Ackermann was trying to wade east to west across the swollen stream with a 27-year-old man from France about 1 p.m. Saturday. The pair were headed in the direction of the bus. The two hikers had tied themselves onto a rope that had been placed across the stream earlier this summer. They lost their footing and were pulled under by the current.The man told Alaska State Troopers and rangers from Denali National Park and Preserve that he was able to cut himself free from the main line and make his way to the bank, where he dropped his backpack. When he turned back, the man said, Ackermann was under water.The hiker made his way back and cut her loose from the main line. He floated downstream with her for half a mile. When the man pulled her to shore, Ackermann was unresponsive. The man tried to resuscitate her but was unsuccessful.The French hiker ran into another hiking party, which reported the incident to troopers and the National Park Service. Ackermann’s body and the French hiker were flown out by a park helicopter Saturday evening.Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said a trooper asked the French man whether they were hiking to the old green-and-white bus. “He said ‘no,’” Peters said. “He said they were just hiking in the area.”“It’s anybody’s guess what they were doing out there,” she said.The bus, located about 18 miles from the end of Stampede Road off the Parks Highway in Healy, has become a destination for people from around the world since Jon Krakauer wrote his best-selling book “Into the Wild” in 1996. After the book was adapted into a critically acclaimed film starring Emile Hirsch and directed by Sean Penn three years ago, the number of hikers trying to reach the bus increased significantly.Troopers and park service rangers have conducted several search and rescues involving hikers who have become lost or stranded while hiking to the bus in the last few years.A month ago, troopers rescued four teenagers who became stranded on their way to the abandoned bus. The teens, ages 16 and 17, got separated after their vehicle became stuck on Stampede Trail. The teens were found by a Fairbanks trooper in a Super Cub and a Cantwell trooper on an ATV.“Everybody has noticed an increase (in the number of hikers going to the bus) in the last three years,” said Richard Moore, north district ranger for Denali National Park and Preserve. There is “general concern” because many of the people hiking to the bus are inexperienced in the Alaska backcountry, he said.“We try to give information to people and tell them that they should be prepared and educated about how to travel in the backcountry,” Moore said.The Stampede Trail river crossing is along the park’s northern boundary and park rangers are still trying to determine if Ackermann drowned inside or outside of the park. She was about a half-mile inside the park boundary when she was brought to shore by her companion.The Teklanika River, about 10 miles from the end of Stampede Road, poses the biggest challenge — and threat — for hikers on the Stampede Trail. The swift, glacier-fed stream is difficult to cross even at low water.On Saturday, the river was raging because of glacial melting in the warm temperatures, park spokesperson Kris Fister said.A week and a half ago, two hikers called Nierenberg on their satellite phone when they couldn’t get back across the river after hiking to the bus.Nierenberg told them they could wade upstream to look for a better place to cross or wait until early morning to cross when the water was at its lowest point. He also gave them the phone number for Era Aviation to call for a helicopter if they wanted to spend the 1,000 or so that would cost.As it turned out, the two hikers met three others, and the group was able to cross.For whatever reason, Nierenberg said, he has seen an increase in the amount of bus traffic this summer. Some of the hikers stop at his lodge to talk about the trail and river crossing, but most of them don’t, he said. The ones that stop usually don’t have a clue what they’re doing, Nierenberg said.“Most of these guys don’t have any conception of river crossings,” he said. “Most of their knowledge is from YouTube.”The rope across the river, which is still in place, appears to be about 3/8-inch braided, nylon rope and is tied on both ends to small trees and brush, said Moore, who has seen pictures. A rope across the river is not uncommon, the ranger said.“Every time I’ve gone out there, someone has put up a rope somewhere across the river,” he said. “It either gets broken or taken down or disappears in the winter.”Using a rope as a crossing aid is risky, Moore said.“If properly used, it could help, but unfortunately a lot of people don’t use it properly, and it leads to incidents like we had Saturday,” he said.Most people bring rope to help get them across the river, Nierenberg said. A former park ranger in Denali, Nierenberg said he was trained to cross rivers using walking sticks or a pole pointed upstream held by multiple people.“Some of these guys are talking about crossing with rope tied around their waist, which is like suicide,” he said.A rope, he said, “is like tying yourself into a raft in whitewater — it can help you live or it can help you die.”Nierenberg speculated that a group of five motorcyclists from the Lower 48, who hiked to the bus about three weeks ago, installed the rope. One of the motorcyclists was nearly swept downriver after getting knocked off his feet on the way back, he said.“He was holding onto the rope and ended up having to let go,” said Nierenberg, who talked to the men before they left and when they returned. “His friends ran downstream and fished him out.“When he came back here his eyes were pretty wide,” Nierenberg said. “He knew that he had almost died.”Rangers are still trying to determine whether the rope is inside or outside the park boundary, Moore said.“Our best guess is one side may be in the park and the other side may not be in the park,” he said.If the rope is inside the park, Moore said, rangers will remove it. If the rope is on state land, he said, rangers will notify troopers.What action troopers might take is unclear, Peters said.“I think we will have to await word from the rangers before that would be assessed,” she wrote in an e-mail. “I don’t know if that would be an appropriate use of our resources, as it would have to be decided if it was an immediate threat to public safety.”Contact staff writer Tim Mowry at 459-7587. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The news article discusses the drowning of a 29-year-old Swiss woman, Claire Jane Ackermann, in the Teklanika River in Alaska while attempting to cross it to reach the well-known abandoned bus from the movie \\"Into the Wild.\\" The bus has become a popular destination for adventurers since Chris McCandless starved to death there in 1992, which later inspired Jon Krakauer's best-selling book and a critically acclaimed film.

This is evident from her statement, \\"I'm sick of this business. In fact, you just heard my last performance. First thing Monday morning I'm going out to find me a real job. One that will pay the bills.\\" Throughout the passage, there are no clear indications to support options A, C, or D. Her conversation with Jason suggests disillusionment with the music industry, as she is planning to quit performing and find a stable source of income that will pay her bills. While Jason's thoughts about Sondra are romantic, there is no indication that Sondra herself is interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with him, nor is there any information supporting the idea that she wants to explore new opportunities within the music industry. In summary, the passage strongly suggests that Sondra's main desire is to find a stable job that can provide her with financial security, moving away from her current career in the music industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is Gianni's job? Movie title: C'eravamo tanto amati Movie plot: In the first part (shot in black-and-white) the friends Gianni (Gassman), Antonio (Manfredi) and Nicola (Satta Flores) are partisans who fight for the liberation of Italy from the yoke of Nazi occupation and the fascist collaborationists aiding in it. After the end of World War II, the three go for different lives: Nicola in Nocera Inferiore (southern Italy), Antonio in Rome and Gianni in Pavia. Later, both Antonio and Gianni fall in love with young Luciana (Sandrelli), and through their relationships go back to the history of post-war Italy, along with the related hopes and disappointments. Gianni, now a lawyer's assistant, moves to Rome and arranges to marry the semi-illiterate daughter of a construction tycoon with questionable fame, a former fascist who managed to get good connections with the pro-American conservative Christian democratic party dominating public life (and building licenses) in post-war Italy. His wife, resenting her inadequacy, tries to turn into the woman he longs for but ultimately fails and dies in a car accident. Antonio, worker in a hospital, has instead remained loyal to the ideals of their youth, and is now a fervent communist activist. Nicola, the most intellectual of the trio, leaves Nocera and his family and moves to Rome, too, to try win a fortune on the famous TV quiz Lascia o raddoppia. After his failure, he leads an economically troubled life writing occasional articles for newspapers, increasingly turning himself into a caricature of an intellectual, lost in futile polemics. After several decades the three friends meet again in the trattoria where they spent their last evening together, commenting bitterly on their lives. Antonio, the orderly has less to complain about and tells his other friends that Luciana has become his wife and he now has two children with her. Later in the evening Nicola argues with him on ideological questions, eventually physically attacking him. In the fray, Gianni loses his driving license and the following day Antonio, Nicola and Luciana try to...

Date Sunday 22 May 2016 Add punctuation","completion":"Date: Sunday, 22 May 2016 Add punctuation: On Sunday, May 22, 2016, we were given the task to add punctuation to a sentence or a piece of text. Punctuation is a crucial part of written communication, as it helps convey the intended meaning, tone, and structure. Without the proper use of punctuation, text can become difficult to understand, and the intended messages may be lost or misconstrued. Punctuation marks that are commonly used include the comma (,), period (.), question mark (?), exclamation point (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), quotation marks (\\" \\"), apostrophe ('), brackets ([]), braces ({}), parentheses (()), ellipsis (...), hyphen (-), en dash (–), em dash (—), and slash (/). Each of these punctuation marks has a specific purpose and rules for proper usage. Here is a breakdown of how to use some of the most common punctuation marks: 1. Commas (,): Commas are used to separate items in a list, clauses in a compound sentence, and to indicate a pause in speech. They can also be used to separate an introductory phrase or word from the main part of the sentence. Example: I bought apples, bananas, and oranges at the store. 2. Periods (.): Periods are used at the end of a complete sentence to indicate a full stop. Example: She went to the gym after work. 3. Question marks (?): Question marks are used at the end of a sentence to indicate that it is a question. Example: Are you going to the concert tonight? 4. Exclamation points (!): Exclamation points are used to express strong emotions or to indicate that a sentence should be read with emphasis. Example: Watch out for the car! 5. Colons (:): Colons are used to introduce a list or to separate two independent clauses when the second clause explains or illustrates the first. Example: She has three favorite colors: red, blue, and green. 6. Semicolons (;): Semicolons are used to connect two independent clauses that are related in meaning but could also stand alone. Example: I have a big presentation today; I stayed up all night preparing for it. 7. Quotation marks (\\" \\"): Quotation marks are used to indicate direct speech, a quote, or the title of a short work (such as a poem or an article). Example: She asked, \\"Do you need any help?\\" 8. Apostrophes ('): Apostrophes are used to indicate possession or to create contractions. Example: Sara's book is on the table. (possession) Example: She's going to the movies. (contraction) 9. Parentheses (()): Parentheses are used to set off additional information or an explanation within a sentence. Example: She has two cats (Simba and Nala) who love to play together. 10. Hyphens (-): Hyphens are used to connect compound words or to separate syllables of a single word when it is broken across two lines of text. Example: My twenty-five-year-old cousin will be starting college in the fall. In conclusion, the proper use of punctuation is essential for clear and effective written communication. Learning how and when to use each punctuation mark will greatly improve your writing and make it easier for others to understand your intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: The logo on the side of the locomotive of the 0905 Budapest to Munich Intercity train could not have been more ironic: \\"Pan-European Picnic - 25 years of Open Borders.\\" The Pan-European Picnic was the remarkable event on the Hungarian-Austrian border in August 1989, when the border guards of Communist Hungary defied orders and stood aside and allowed hundreds of East German refugees to run across the border into Austria. The green carriages of the train to Munich on Thursday morning soon filled with Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and a host of other nationalities. They were trapped in Hungary by the decision of the Hungarian government to block their route to Germany. But the train did not go to Munich. The gates of the station had opened at 08:20, closely followed by a stampede of refugees. At 08:52 the government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, informed me that the refugees would be taken to refugee camps instead. At 11:00 the train left, and at 12:00 it arrived in Bicske, the site of a refugee camp, 37km (23 miles) west of Budapest. The refugees refused to leave, and a 28-hour standoff with police developed. I spoke to local people, who wandered down to the tracks to see world news unfolding on their doorstep. Many Hungarians, especially those fed a diet of anti-migrant vitriol on state radio and television, are suspicious of the thousands of people from other cultures now traipsing through their country. So I was surprised when one woman said quietly to me: \\"You should remember that many of us, Hungarians, were refugees too\\". She belonged to the Hungarian minority in Romania, and fled to the country in the 1980s, to escape the terrifying regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, she said. Hungarian government officials insist that there is no parallel between 1989 and 2015. Or between the Iron Curtain which once split Europe, and the razor wire fence they are still reinforcing along their southern border with Serbia. Or between the 1956 revolution, when a quarter of a million Hungarians escaped across the same border into Austria, to escape Soviet tanks, and current events. But the fact is that many Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, Poles, Serbs and Romanians, not to mention Germans and Austrians, have personal memories of having to run for their lives. Some remember those stories from their parents and grandparents. And when they see the refugees in Hungary today, they are torn between an official rhetoric which often demonises \\"illegal migrants\\", and their own experience of expulsion and charity. One big difference between 1956, 1989, and 2015 is cultural. Many of the new arrivals are Muslims. Some are Africans. These are not Europeans fleeing within Europe. Walk the streets of Budapest, Prague or Bratislava, and the faces are more homogenous. Only the Chinese and Vietnamese are here already in large numbers. This is largely the result of the mass murders and forced population movements of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath. Another problem is a genuine resentment in eastern Europe at being talked down to by west European leaders. For the Hungarians, the sheer numbers now are also an important factor. By Saturday night, 175,000 asylum seekers had been registered by the Hungarian authorities this year - 50,000 in August alone. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned that millions, not hundreds of thousands of migrants will flood Europe. Nobody knows if that is true, not even Mr Orban, but only one year ago two million Hungarians trusted his word enough to vote him into office for four more years. There is also now a sort of rearguard action by the governments of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to defend what they regard as \\"Christian Europe\\" from those it regards as \\"aliens\\". Robert Fico's Slovak government only reluctantly agreed to accept 200 asylum seekers from Syria, awaiting processing in neighbouring Austria, on condition that they are Christian. Yet another factor in the migration equation is the large ethnic Roma population in eastern Europe. Hungarian Justice Minister Laszlo Trocsanyi caused a stir recently by suggesting that Hungary could hardly help so many refugees, when it already has 800,000 Roma to integrate. Some criminal gangs from the Roma clans of eastern Hungary stand accused of muscling in on the lucrative business of trafficking migrants from the Serbian border to Austria. But most Roma are watching the current crisis from the sidelines. In Budapest, a man begging outside the East Station claimed to be Syrian. \\"Don't believe him\\", shouted a woman from the doorway of a shop - \\"he's a local\\". For local, read Roma. East station has now been re-Christened \\"the Middle East station\\", in popular parlance, because of the sheer number of Syrians and Iraqis around it. And the \\"pan-global picnic\\" continues, on every platform. Summary:","completion":"The logo on the Budapest to Munich Intercity train reads \\"Pan-European Picnic - 25 years of Open Borders\\" in reference to the historic event in 1989 when the Hungarian-Austrian border was opened, allowing East German refugees to cross into Austria. However, the recent journey saw the train filled with Syrian, Afghan, and Iraqi refugees, stopped by the Hungarian government and the passengers taken to refugee camps. Hungary has seen 175,000 asylum seekers registered within its borders just this year, with 50,000 arriving in August alone. The Hungarian government, along with Slovakia and the Czech Republic, are attempting to defend what they see as \\"Christian Europe\\" from the influx of refugees, leading to a clash between citizens' memories of their own past experiences as refugees and the often demonizing rhetoric surrounding \\"illegal migrants.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the man loses 60% by selling 20 pencils for a rupee, we will calculate the cost price as follows: Let the cost price of 1 pencil be x. Selling price of 20 pencils = 1 rupee Since there is a 60% loss, we know that the selling price (1 rupee) is 40% of the cost price (1 - loss percentage). Now, let's calculate the cost price of 20 pencils: 1 (selling price) = 40% of cost price 1 = 0.4 * (20 * x) => x = 1 / 8 Now we know the cost price of 1 pencil is 1/8 rupees.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Photo That Changed America's Civil Rights Movement The raw videos depict the last moments of Philando Castile‘s and Alton Sterling‘s lives. Widely shared on social media – one of them live – they have shocked an entire nation. Like the videos that showed the killings of Walter L. Scott, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner in 2014 and 2015, they provide the necessary imagery to force us to address, once again, the pervasive and inherent racial inequalities that still exist across the country. More than 60 years ago, when racial segregation was still the norm in many states, one grieving mother, Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley, understood the power of imagery to expose America’s racism. In August 1955, Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he stopped at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. There he encountered Carolyn Bryant, a white woman. Whether Till really flirted with Bryant or whistled at her isn’t known. But what happened four days later is. Bryant’s husband Roy and his half brother, J.W. Milam, seized the 14-year-old from his great-uncle’s house. The pair then beat Till, shot him, and strung barbed wire and a 75-pound metal fan around his neck and dumped the lifeless body in the Tallahatchie River. A white jury quickly acquitted the men, with one juror saying it had taken so long only because they had to break to drink some pop. When Till’s mother Mamie came to identify her son, she told the funeral director, “Let the people see what I’ve seen.” She brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till’s remains, but it was the publication of the searing image photographed by David Jackson and first published in Jet magazine, with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child’s ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism. For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother’s determination to expose the barbarousness of the crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn’t see. In this video narrated by Bryan Stevenson, an attorney and the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has no doubt: “Without the images,” he says “no one would be prepared to believe the violence we’ve witnessed.” In revisiting Jackson’s photograph today, he believes, “that image still has resonance, it still has power. I think it still expresses the pain and anguish of a huge part of our population that is still hoping for basic recognition of their humanity.” Summary:","completion":"The brutal murder of Emmett Till, a black teenager, in 1955 and the publication of his mutilated body's image in Jet magazine, marked a turning point in the American civil rights movement. The image, captured by David Jackson, exposed the extent of racial violence and forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism. Today, videos capturing the killings of people like Philando Castile and Alton Sterling serve a similar purpose, highlighting racial inequalities across the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The food was below average, with my steak being overcooked and bland, and the side dishes lacked flavor and creativity. It seemed as though little effort was put into the preparation and presentation of the dishes, which was disheartening considering the reputation of the restaurant. The service I received was slow and unresponsive. Our server took a long time to take our order, as well as to bring our food and drinks. When we needed something, it was difficult to get their attention, and when we finally did, they often forgot our requests. It made me feel like our dining experience was not a priority to the staff, which was frustrating. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also not what I expected. The lighting was too bright and harsh, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the meal. The noise level was also quite high, as the tables were closely packed together and conversations from other diners made it hard to carry on a conversation with my own party.

Winning several critical battles, this leads to a significant decline in the cartel's influence in key areas such as Cordoba, Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca. As a result, peace and stability gradually return to these regions, while the people of Mexico begin to rebuild their lives and communities in a safer environment. Throughout this process, the Mexican government works closely with the United States and other international partners to improve border security and prevent the expansion of the Zetas and other drug cartels into new territories. These cooperative efforts prove successful, contributing to a safer and more secure future for both Mexico and its neighbors. Step-by-step justification: 1. Given that Raul Lucio Hernandez Lechuga, a key figure in the Zetas, is captured, it's logical to assume that the authorities would intensify their efforts to dismantle the cartel. 2. As these efforts are successful in critical battles, the cartel's influence in the mentioned regions would diminish. 3. Peace and stability returning to the affected regions is a positive outcome for the people living there. 4. The mention of international cooperation with partners, particularly the United States, aligns with efforts to address the broader issue of drug cartels and their expansion into other territories. 5.

Jennifer asked Felicia to help them make a diet plan and exercise routine. Possible answers: [i] Jennifer wanted to lose weight.. [ii] Felicia wanted to lose weight..","completion":"To determine the correct ending of the sentence, let's analyze the sentence information and use context clues. The sentence states that \\"Jennifer asked Felicia to help them make a diet plan and exercise routine.\\" Now, let's analyze the possible answers: [i] Jennifer wanted to lose weight. [ii] Felicia wanted to lose weight. In option [i], it suggests that Jennifer is the one seeking assistance to create a diet plan and exercise routine, which makes sense since the sentence indicates Jennifer is the one asking for help. Therefore, it's logical to assume that Jennifer is the one wanting to lose weight. In option [ii], although it mentions Felicia, it would be less likely for Felicia to be the one wanting to lose weight since she is not the one requesting the diet plan and exercise routine. Based on the analysis, the most logical ending to the sentence would be: Jennifer asked Felicia to help them make a diet plan and exercise routine because Jennifer wanted to lose weight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But water also can be dangerous for kids if you don't take great care. Nearly 1,000 kids die each year by drowning. Here are some tips to keep your kids safe in the water: At the Lake or Pond *Don't let little kids swim alone without adult supervision-- lakes or ponds may be shallow near the bank and are suddenly deep sharply further out from shore. *Ponds and lakes may hide jagged rocks, broken glass, or rubbish. *Make sure kids wear foot protection; even in the water, they should wear socks or water shoes. *Watch out for weeds and grass in the water that could trap a leg or arm. *Most boating accidents, particularly among teenagers, are related to alcohol . Be sure teens know about the dangers of alcohol, on and off the water. At the Beach *Teach kids to always swim when and where a lifeguard is on duty. Unlike the calm waters of a swimming pool, the beach has special dangers like currents and tides . Check with the lifeguard when you arrive to find out about the water conditions. *Tell kids never to stand with their back to the water because a sudden wave can easily knock a child over. *Teach kids that if they're caught in a dangerous wave, they should swim parallel to the shore or should tread water and call for a lifeguard's help. Whether at the lake or at the beach, teach your child to get out of the water during bad weather, especially lightning. Question: Which is the right behavior when swimming at the beach? - Go off the water without a lifeguard on duty - Go on swimming in a heavy rain - Go off the water before checking the water conditions - Call for help if caught in a dangerous wave Answer:","completion":"Call for help if caught in a dangerous wave"},{"prompt":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Space exploration.

Does it follow that \\"I think she looked very sickly and tired.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"I think she looked very sickly and tired\\" can be extrapolated from \\"She looked very tired and ill, I thought.\\" Both sentences convey the same overarching idea: the observer's perception that the woman appeared to be tired and not in good health. In both instances, the speaker professes their personal view on the woman's condition, emphasizing their impression that she is unwell. However, the expressions and words used in each sentence differ slightly, which results in two unique interpretations of the same opinion. In the original sentence, \\"She looked very tired and ill, I thought\\", the phrase \\"I thought\\" indicates that the speaker is reflecting on a past observation of the woman. The choice of words \\"tired\\" and \\"ill\\" suggest that the woman's appearance seemed to indicate exhaustion and poor health. Putting \\"I thought\\" at the end of the sentence emphasizes the idea that this is the speaker's perspective on the situation. On the other hand, the rephrased statement, \\"I think she looked very sickly and tired,\\" places the emphasis on the speaker's thoughts by positioning \\"I think\\" at the beginning of the sentence. The use of the word \\"sickly\\" rather than \\"ill\\" creates a stronger impression of the woman's apparent unwell state.

Information: - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.

Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life. About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there. On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called \\"Chocolate or Toys\\". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice. This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining . A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict and how much she hated her mother. \\"I want a new mom,\\" she cried. \\"Unluckily, you can't have one,\\" the leader replied. \\"You have to accept the mother that you have.\\" This hit me hard.

Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.' Sharpton's decision to distance himself from Rubenstein underlines the severity of the allegations against the attorney. The National Action Network, a civil rights organization founded by Sharpton, is likely facing a difficult time in light of these accusations, as Rubenstein played a crucial role in many of the group's high-profile legal cases. It seems that the organization is striving to protect its own reputation as well as Sharpton's by refraining from commenting on the ongoing investigation. The collection of potential evidence from Rubenstein's Upper East Side apartment suggests that the police are taking these allegations very seriously. The presence of bloody condoms and a sex toy might provide crucial information regarding the events that transpired after Sharpton's birthday celebration, ultimately helping to determine whether the accusations against Rubenstein hold any merit.

Blind rivets can be installed from 1 side and create secure fastenings without the hammering process necessary for solid rivet installation. Standard blind rivets are the most affordable type and are great for holes that are regularly shaped and aligned properly. Use standard blind rivets for securing metal pieces that aren't going to carry lots of weight. To determine the maximum weight your rivets can hold, look at the back of the package for their shear strength. Never use standard rivets for situations that require a water-proof seal. If you're working with important structural joints, don't use blind rivets. Instead, use solid rivets with a pneumatic rivet gun. These rivets have a wider grip range and always completely fill the holes in your metal due to their \\"bulbing\\" action. They are best suited for irregular, oversized, or misaligned holes, as well as situations where you're unsure of the optimal rivet length. Multi-grip rivet seals are weather and vibration-proof. Sealed rivets possess an enclosed mandrel (the longer end) that creates a water-tight seal upon installation. They can fasten many kinds of materials and perform well across varying temperature fluctuations and thicknesses. If you don't need a water-tight seal, opt for standard rivets instead—they're typically cheaper than sealed products. Interlock rivets are best if you need increased pull-out and shear strength, such as in structural applications. They come in large sizes that typically don't fit the smaller rivet guns. Interlock rivets work great for closing big gaps and preventing sheet movement. Dome head rivets are the most common type for pop guns due to their versatility and simple application. They're best used for situations that require reliability and safety. For example, thousands of dome head rivets are used to create the structural frame of modern aircraft. If you're unsure of the applicability of dome heads for your situation, take a look at their packaging to determine the shear strength (listed as weight in pounds) that they can support. Use dome heads when connecting material similar to carbon steel, when the rivet is close to the edge of the material you are fastening. These blind rivets are also called round heads. Flat rivets are countersunk and ideal for soft materials, which are defined as anything easily deformed by temperature extremes or fluctuations, such as polymers, granular materials, and soft biological materials. This is due to their large head that increases their load-bearing area. They are also ideal for situations where nearby rivets and structures make it impossible to accommodate round heads. Load-bearing area is the region that the load-bearing structure can reliably hold up. There are many different kinds of rivet materials. Always match the rivet to the type of metal you're attaching whenever possible. For example, aluminum metal should be fastened with aluminum rivets. If you're fastening leather with a rivet, always use copper, aluminum, or brass. Steel rivets will rust due to leather's tendency to retain moisture. Steel mandrels have a tendency to corrode, and can also create a reaction with surrounding materials. Avoid purchasing rivets that are made from steel mandrels paired with a stainless steel or aluminum body. Purchase a variety pack for a wide selection of rivets of different sizes and materials.

Article: Your doctor will need to perform several tests to determine if you have diabetes. If you do, in fact, have diabetes or pre-diabetes, you will need to follow-up with regular treatment by following your doctor's instructions. The blood glucose test does exactly what it sounds like it does: it tests the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. This will be used to determine whether you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it. This test will done under one of three circumstances: A fasting glucose blood test is done after you haven't had anything to eat for at least eight hours. If it is an emergency, your doctor will do a random blood glucose test regardless of whether you have eaten recently. A two-hour postprandial test is done two hours after eating a specific number of carbohydrates to test your body's ability to handle the sugar load. This test is usually done in a hospital so they can measure the number of carbs eaten before the test. An oral glucose tolerance test requires you to drink a high glucose fluid. They will test your blood and urine every 30-60 minutes to measure how well the body is able to tolerate the additional load. This test is not done if the doctor suspects type 1 diabetes. This blood test is also called the glycated hemoglobin test. It measures the amount of sugar attached to the body's hemoglobin molecules. This measurement gives the doctor a good indication of your average blood sugar measurements over the past 30 to 60 days. Ketone is found in the blood when an insulin shortage forces the body to break down fat for energy. It comes out through the urine, most often in patients with type 1 diabetes. Your doctor may recommend a blood or urine test for ketone: If your blood sugar is higher than 240 mg/dL. During an illness such as pneumonia, stroke or heart attack. If you experience nausea and vomiting. During pregnancy. If you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it, it's important to monitor your health and blood sugar levels regularly. High blood sugar will cause damage to the microvascular (micro-blood vessels) in your organs. This damage can cause problems throughout the body.

A recovering heroin addict, she has just completed a three-year sentence for robbery to support her addiction. Although she has her own private room, she has chores she must perform and must share a pay phone with the other residents.Accustomed to using sex to get what she wants, she quickly seduces Andy (Rio Hackford), who manages the house. She also performs oral sex on her job placement counselor so he will get her the job she wants working in a daycare center. Sherry struggles with wanting to use again, and befriends Dean (Danny Trejo), a fellow recovery group member who remembers her from a bar she used to frequent when she was underage.She wants to be a good mother to her daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who has been cared for by Sherry's brother, Bobby (Brad Henke), and sister-in-law, Lynette (Bridget Barkan). Alexis is confused about her mother's return, a situation that is not helped by Lynette's disapproval of Sherry and insistence that Alexis call her mother and Sherry by her first name.Sherry gets into conflict with another woman at Genesis and moves in with Bobby and Lynette. When her father (Sam Bottoms) and his wife come for a visit, Sherry tries to impress everyone by singing \\"Eternal Flame,\\" but the family is clearly more interested in Alexis and uncomfortable around Sherry. Alexis tells Sherry that Lynette doesn't want her to call Sherry mother, and Alexis and Lynette fight. Bobby takes Sherry to a motel. The next day, when Sherry reports to her parole officer, Hernandez (Giancarlo Esposito), he threatens to send her back to prison because she did not go through proper channels to leave Genesis.

After being released from prison and struggling with her heroin addiction, Sherry wishes to reconnect with her daughter and assume her role as a responsible and loving mother. Throughout the film, we see Sherry facing numerous challenges and obstacles in her path towards rebuilding her life and strengthening her relationship with Alexis. The tension between Sherry and her sister-in-law, Lynette, who has been taking care of Alexis during Sherry's incarceration, further complicates the situation. Lynette's disapproval of Sherry and her insistence that Alexis should not call Sherry \\"mother\\" show the level of estrangement Sherry experiences in her family. While Sherry's desire to repair her relationship with her daughter is the primary focus, we can also sense her attempts to reconnect with her brother, Bobby, and mend the strained ties with the rest of her family. Although her methods are sometimes misguided, such as seducing Andy or performing oral sex to secure a job, we can see Sherry's effort to regain stability and to make amends for her past mistakes. Another relationship that plays a role in Sherry's life is the one with Dean, whom she meets in her recovery group. This relationship is significant because it serves as an emotional support system for Sherry as she navigates the challenges of sobriety and rebuilding her life after prison. In conclusion, Sherry Swanson in the movie \\"Sherrybaby\\" primarily seeks to repair her relationship with her daughter, Alexis, in order to become a better mother and regain her place in her family. Along the way, she faces numerous obstacles, which highlight the struggles of addiction and recovery, and test her resolve to rebuild her life and reconnect with her loved ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a 110-year wait, Hull City's European adventure very nearly lasted just seven days until Sone Aluko intervened to prolong their stay. But on the evidence of this lethargic and naïve performance, Steve Bruce's side will have to re-emerge with a newfound vigour and maturity when they face a final qualifier later this month. For now, though, relief is the overriding emotion on Humberside. VIDEO Scroll down for Steve Bruce is delighted for the supporters after a late win. Winner: Sone Aluko celebrates scoring the pivotal goal in the 2-1 win for Hull City against AS Trencin. Technique: The substitute adjusted well to fire home the winner at the KC Stadium. Delight: Hull City's European adventure can now continue. Crucial: Ahmed Elmohamady nods home an equaliser for Hull City against AS Trencin. Dream start: Tomas Malec gave the visitors a shock lead early on in the UEFA Europa League qualifier. HULL CITY: McGregor 6; Bruce 6 (Ince 66, 6) Chester 6, Davies 6; Elmohamady 7, Livermore 6, Huddlestone 5 Snodgrass 5, Brady 6 (Rosenior 56, 6); Sagbo 7, Long 5 (Aluko 74, 7) Subs not used: Harper, McShane, Quinn. Booked: Long. Goals: Elmohamady 27, 80. AS TRENCIN: Volesak, Ramon, Klescik, Cogley, Hajrandinovic (Opatovsky 64), Misak (Mondek 82), Holubek, Lobotka, Simon (Rundic 90), Kubik, Malec. Subs not used: Semrinec, Skovajsa, Baris,. Booked: Holubek, Malek. Goal: Malek 2. They were 10 minutes away from suffering a humiliating first-round exit at the hands of the Slovakian minnows. Hull's players had already talked of winning the Europa League in Warsaw next May but they were staring at a nightmare until substitute Aluko pounced to volley home from six yards in the 80th minute. The goal keeps alive the dream of facing the likes of Inter Milan at the KC Stadium this season. To give their journey some perspective, exactly 10 years ago last night Hull were playing Bournemouth in League One. They won 1-0. Go back 15 years and they were getting beat 1-0 at Exeter City in England's bottom tier. Bruce handed a full debut to £6million signing Robert Snodgrass as he attempted to inject some energy following a sluggish showing during the goalless draw in Zilna last week. Trencin signalled their intention from the off when Haris Hajradinovic attempted to lob Allan McGregor from kick-off, the Scottish goalkeeper panicked enough to scramble before gathering. Battle: Shane Long fights for possession with Peter Cogley at the KC Stadium. But there was nothing he could do to prevent Trencin's shock opener just 90 seconds later as Frantisek Kubik escaped down the right and drew back for Tomas Malec to apply a measured finish. The visitors threatened to double their advantage when a well-worked free-kick landed at the feet of Jakub Holubek and he stung the palms of McGregor with a vicious strike from 20 yards. Hull should have been level when Shane Long broke free on 15 minutes but his dink was read by Milos Volesak and the stopper spread his frame to block. Long, though, was guilty of a glaring miss soon after when Snodgrass screwed a shot in to his unmarked feet on the edge of the six-yard box. First he stabbed tamely at Volesak before swiping at fresh air when the ball rebounded. It was an embarrassing passage which left the forward on the floor, face hidden in shame. Proving his worth: New signing Jake Livermore storms through midfield with the ball. But the KC crowd – and Long – exhaled a collective relief just moments later when Robbie Brady loaded a cross from the left and Ahmed Elmohamady rose to power a header into the bottom corner. Long was enduring a miserable night and he somehow headed straight at nemesis Volesak when a corner was deflected onto his brow just four yards from goal. Liam Rosenior was introduced after half-time and his first touch – a 25-yard drive – very nearly nestled in the top corner and Tom Huddlestone lashed narrowly over on 73 minutes. The home side continued to press and their prayers were answered when Aluko connected with Snodgrass' knock-down just yards from goal.

McCarthy is fielding hundreds of emails from the lonely, the curious and the adventurous, all seeking a stranger’s ambulatory company. “I try to listen more than talk,” he said this week, striding past handsome houses in Los Feliz, a leafy neighbourhood near Hollywood. Conversations with clients are seldom confessional, but he respects confidences. “It’s mostly surface, small-talk type stuff. But I think it’s therapeutic even if they’re not baring their souls.” It’s mostly surface, small-talk type stuff. But I think it’s therapeutic even if they’re not baring their souls Chuck McCarthy Grumbling about traffic, for instance, felt better when delivered to an actual human ear rather than posted on social media. “Tweeting about it and getting no response just makes you feel sadder.” So many requests have poured in that McCarthy has recruited five other walkers to serve different parts of LA, though he will not take any cut from their earnings until he figures out a professional business model. Commenters on his Facebook page offer plenty of advice. “Charge more and scale it up. Figure out what the secret sauce is – personality, being a supremely good listener, paying attention to inane bullshit, etc – then train your walker bees accordingly.” It could grow fast. A woman in Israel has copied the idea, someone in Britain wants him to do it there, and a guy in New York asked him to walk his eight-year-old son to the bus stop each day. McCarthy, bemused and excited by the attention, is considering crowdfunding to hire techies to design an Uber-style app. In addition to ensuring proximity – he wants to stay local and on foot, not drive across town, let alone fly thousands of miles – the app would let walkers and clients rate each other for personability and walking speed. The latter is a key point for walkers since a slow pace, say two miles an hour, yields 14, versus 28 for a brisk four miles an hour. Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) Just been walked by LA's first people walker, @ideasbychuck. 7 per mile. If an uber I'd give him 5 stars. pic.twitter.com/nKel8YbcH2 “Awesome concept, plenty of screwed up lonely people out there,” said one of his Facebook commenters, suggesting the job is more people whisperer than walker. But according to McCarthy, paying to be walked does not mean people are friendless. It just means they cannot always coordinate leisure time with friends, a product of fluid schedules in the gig economy, leaving them isolated. “We’re on phones and computers constantly communicating but we’re not connecting as much. We need that human interaction.” We’re on phones and computers constantly communicating but we’re not connecting as much Chuck McCarthy We also need exercise. McCarthy has slimmed down two notches on his belt since starting the professional walking. “I try not to run because it could ruin my brand,” he deadpanned. Originally from Atlanta, McCarthy is serious enough about acting that he declines to reveal his exact age, beyond saying he is in his 30s. He has found bit parts – most recently in a promo for the film Pete’s Dragon – since moving to LA a decade ago, but no breakthrough role. “I grew the beard so I could play homeless people.” And, potentially, homicidal bikers. He is hopeful of landing that role. McCarthy stresses that he is not a personal trainer. “I’m more about motivating someone to leave their house and walk than being a drill sergeant shouting at them.” Might the daily treks up and down Los Feliz lead to a movie treatment? Thinner material, after all, has made it to the screen. The people walker grinned. “Why not? Maybe (Jean-Claude) Van Damme will play me.” ||||| A photo posted by Chuck McCarthy (@chuckhistory) on Jun 27, 2016 at 5:06pm PDT In a society ripe with an obscene amount of excess capital sloshing around the top, only barely trickling down to the vast remainder of the population (billions of people), things are bound to get funky. The 'gig' or 'sharing' economy is a prime example; people with no choice but to work on a short-term, contractual basis without the benefits of a 401K, healthcare or the promise of a sustainable future. While this usually ends up looking like a job with Uber or Postmates, a Hollywood man has decided to take advantage of our society's other defining trait—that is, chronic disconnection and loneliness—to make ends meet. Chuck McCarthy is the founder of \\"People Walker.\\" No, it's not a sex thing. Rather, for 7 a mile, McCarthy or one of his employees will keep you company while you go for a simple walk. As his flyer explains, McCarthy offers his services for those who need a kick of motivation to go walking, those who don't feel safe walking alone, and those who are afraid that other people might see them walking alone and think that they (the customer) has no friends. See, McCarthy was was first thinking about becoming a dog walker. He's an aspiring actor playing the hard-knock industry game, just waiting for a his big break. But, as he explained frankly to KABC earlier this week, \\"I didn't want to pick up dog poop, and that's kind of what you're getting paid for, really, for dog walking.\\" To be clear, the weekend staff here at LAist has nothing against McCarthy charging folks 7 a mile (is that closer to 14 or 21 hourly, before taxes?). We're, more so, just puzzled that McCarthy has had such a successful time with his startup venture. While safety in (walking) numbers is an understandable benefit, it's not like Fryman Canyon is what one would call a dangerous environment. Believe it or not, McCarthy's business has already grown to at least five people other than himself, covering such areas like downtown L.A., Hollywood, Eagle Rock, Los Feliz and Fairfax. We're not sure whether or not People Walker offers its services along the Pacific Coast, or in the hills of the San Fernando Valley, but maybe it should. As for why someone might want to hire a People Walker, McCarthy's got a handy Q&A; already set up! Honestly, we've got no complaints here. While the fact that people are paying money because they're afraid others might see them walking alone and ostensibly think that they have no friends, anything that gets people out of their cars and into the splendor of Los Angeles' pedestrian environment is an undeniably good thing. Here's to the future of a pedestrian friendly Los Angeles where we're all escorted through the streets by People Walkers!

Well, there's a man named Chuck McCarthy who lives in Hollywood, and he's an actor. Now, acting work can sometimes be hard to come by, so Chuck needed another job to make some extra money. At first, he thought about being a dog walker, but then he didn't really like the idea of having to pick up dog poop. And then - here's the fun part - he had a really cool idea: if people hire dog walkers, why not hire a person to walk people? So that's what he did! He started a business where he walks with people, just like going for a stroll together, and he charges 7 for each mile they walk. It seems like a lot of people like this idea, because they sometimes feel lonely or don't feel safe walking alone. And for Chuck, it's like getting paid to exercise and make new friends!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Considering this, Taylor now has a few options on what to do next: (i) Tear up the note: If Taylor believes that the contents of the note are no longer relevant or accurate, or if they changed their mind about sharing the information, they might choose to tear up the note. This would ensure that their friend never reads it, and they can move forward without any potentially negative consequences from the note being read. (ii) Give the note to their friend: If Taylor still feels that the information in the note is important and wants to share it with their friend, they could choose to give the note to their friend after all. This would show their vulnerability and honesty, and could potentially strengthen their relationship, provided the note's content is well-received by their friend. (iii) Decide they don't like the note: Taylor may decide that the note does not accurately convey the message they want to share with their friend. In this case, Taylor could choose to rewrite the note, making any necessary adjustments to better express their thoughts and feelings before giving it to their friend.

(CNN) -- The entire eastern coast of the United States should prepare for Irene, a large and dangerous hurricane churning northwestward over the tropical waters of the Caribbean, the nation's emergency chief warned Tuesday. At 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said the winds in Irene remained unchanged from its previous update, at 90 mph, making the storm a Category 1 hurricane. However, the reduction is expected to be only temporary, and Irene is still forecast to become a Category 3 event, a major hurricane, by Wednesday night or Thursday, the center said. Irene was moving through the southern Bahamas and will pass very near or over the Turks and Caicos islands later Tuesday night, CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said early Tuesday evening. \\"Quite frankly (the state's) emergency center has done this over and over and over, and we have the best system in OPTIONS: - Bahamas, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - CNN, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Caicos islands, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Caribbean, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Dave Hennen, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Irene, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - National Hurricane Center, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - North Carolina, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - Turks, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" - United States, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\"","completion":"- North Carolina, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong.\\" The correct answer is North Carolina, which refers to the state's emergency center mentioned earlier in the story.

Information: - Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed... - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over 8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma . - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to... - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\". - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more... - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if... - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in... - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States... - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About... - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000... - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not... What object entity has the relation of 'inception' with the subject 'mesothelioma applied research foundation'?

I don't think it's a problem to have a blank wall.” —Annie Leibovitz According to a legend that one of us (Martinez-Conde) heard growing up in Spain, anybody can see the Devil's face. All you need to do is to stare at your own face in the mirror at the stroke of midnight, call the Devil's name and the Prince of Darkness will look back at you. Needless to say, I was both fascinated and terrified by the possibility. And I knew this was an experiment I must try. I waited a day or two to gather my courage, then stayed awake until midnight, got up from my bed, and into the bathroom I went. I closed the door behind me so that my family would not hear me calling out loud for Satan, faced my wide-eyed reflection, made my invocation, and ... nothing happened. I was disenchanted (literally) but also quite relieved. Now, three decades later, a paper entitled “Strange-Face-in-the-Mirror Illusion,” by vision scientist Giovanni B. Caputo of the University of Urbino in Italy, may explain my lack of results. Caputo asked 50 subjects to gaze at their reflected faces in a mirror for a 10-minute session. After less than a minute, most observers began to perceive the “strange-face illusion.” The participants' descriptions included huge deformations of their own faces; seeing the faces of alive or deceased parents; archetypal faces such as an old woman, child or the portrait of an ancestor; animal faces such as a cat, pig or lion; and even fantastical and monstrous beings. All 50 participants reported feelings of “otherness” when confronted with a face that seemed suddenly unfamiliar. Some felt powerful emotions. After reading Caputo's article, I had to give “Satan” another try. I suspected that my failure to see anything other than my petrified self in the mirror 30 years ago had to do with suboptimal lighting conditions for the strange-face illusion to take place. Caputo recommended dim lighting, so that observers might see their facial features in detail but experience attenuated color perception. So this time I turned off the bathroom lights and turned on my cell phone's flashlight, then placed it on the floor behind me, so that I could not see its reflection on the mirror. Then I looked at myself and waited. My efforts were rewarded quickly. Portions of my face started to disappear, contract or expand, and suddenly all the features would come back, giving me a bit of a start. I was particularly thrilled to experience some of the dissociative identity effect that the experimental participants reported, feeling as if the face staring back at me was both mine and yet not mine. Disappointingly, I did not see any monstrous creatures or ghosts of ancestors calling me from the beyond (or even Satan, for that matter), but I think I came close to seeing one of the “archetypal” faces. Weirdly, halfway through the experiment, my face appeared to morph into a sepia portrait of an old Native American warrior. But as soon as it arrived, it was gone. Fade to Gray Why does this happen? To explain, we need to start with Erasmus Darwin, the English natural philosopher and physician and grandfather of Charles Darwin. In the late 18th century he described how objects can fade after steady gazing: “On looking long on an area of scarlet silk of about an inch in diameter laid on white paper ... the scarlet color becomes fainter, till at length it entirely vanishes, though the eye is kept uniformly and steadily upon it.” Swiss philosopher Ignaz Paul Vital Troxler later corroborated Darwin's observations, using colored patches on a wall. The phenomenon became known as Troxler fading. Neural adaptation, the mechanism by which neurons decrease or stop their response to unchanging stimulation, is thought to underlie perceptual fading during prolonged gazing at an object or scene. Once the target of interest has vanished, blinks, gaze shifts and even microscopic involuntary eye movements called microsaccades can restore it to perception instantly [see “Shifting Focus,” by Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen L. Macknik; Scientific American Mind, November/December 2011]. Troxler fading and neural adaptation may partly explain Caputo's strange-face illusion. As we gaze long and steady into our reflected face, the unchanging nature of the visual stimulus causes facial features to disappear and then reappear, as we blink or make involuntary eye movements, thereby “refreshing” our neuronal responses. In the absence of visual information, our brain will “fill in” the gaps according to our experiences, expectations, best guesses, and even hardwired neural mechanisms involved in shape and face perception. The result can be amusing or disquieting. A few years ago I had the opportunity to collaborate with cognitive scientist Daniel Simons (author, with Christopher Chabris, of The Invisible Gorilla, Random House, 2010) and his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on an experiment to investigate visual fading in entire scenes. You can experience the effect by focusing your gaze precisely at the center of the blurry image, while paying attention to the entire scene. Careful staring for just a few seconds will minimize your eye movements, causing the scene to fade to gray. Now stop focusing your gaze, and the scene will come right back. Scientists can make nonblurred scenes fade in the laboratory by completely removing or by compensating for the observer's eye movements. A Fading Impression Impression, Sunrise, by French painter Claude Monet in 1872, gave its name to the Impressionist movement. The subject of the painting is the harbor of Le Havre in France, as seen from Monet's window. It was not, however, Monet's actual view of the scene, as he later explained, but his “impression”—hence the title. Indeed, Sunrise does not accurately represent reality: the rising sun appears much brighter than the surrounding sky, as it should in real life, but that perception is an illusion. Monet used pigments of matching luminance, or brightness, but different chromatic content, or hues, to represent the sun and the sky. Harvard University neurobiologist Margaret Livingstone has proposed that this equiluminant quality, where objects in the image have the same luminance as the background, is what gives the sun its eerie, almost pulsating, lifelike appearance. A black-and-white reproduction reveals that the sun has the same physical luminance as the background clouds. Equiluminant objects are somewhat difficult to see, which makes them more susceptible to Troxler fading. Neuro-ophthalmologists Avinoam B. Safran and Theodor Landis of Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland noticed that if you fix your gaze on the image of the sailor in Monet's painting for several seconds, while paying attention to the sun, the solar disk will disappear progressively, being replaced by the surrounding sky. How Many Dots? This pattern, generated by vision scientist Akiyoshi Kitaoka of Ritsumeikan University in Japan, contains a yellow dot at the center of each set of four blue “petals.” That makes a total of 61 yellow dots! To prove it to yourself, examine each “flower” in turn and see that all of them contain a centralyellow spot. The problem is that you can see only one spot at a time. The othersdisappear when you are not looking at them directly. Lurking Ladybugs In the left image of the pair that makes up this illusion, also by Kitaoka, each of the four squares in the corners has three ladybugs. The little insects are easy to see as you look around the image, but when you stare at the center of the pattern they vanish immediately. The right-hand image shows they do not become invisible by virtue of the small size: in the absence of the squares, all 12 ladybugs are perceptually prominent, no matter where in the image you look. The Healing Grid This illusion, created by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai, then at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, was a top-10 finalist in the 2005 Best Illusion of the Year Contest (http://illusionoftheyear.com). Explore the image freely, and you will see a regular pattern of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines in the center, flanked by an irregular grid of misaligned crosses to the left and right. Choose one of the intersections on the center of the image and stare at it for 30 seconds or so. You will see that the grid “heals” itself, becoming perfectly regular all the way through. The illusion results from both perceptual fading and the ensuing neural guesstimates that our brain imposes to “fill in” the outer parts of the image based on the available information from the center, in addition to our nervous system's intrinsic tendency to seek structure and order, even when the sensory input is fundamentally disorganized. Beauty in the Eye of the Beholder Artwork may contain “errors” that are obvious to our central vision but become invisible when viewed from the corner of our eye. Neuroscientist Denis Pelli of New York University discovered that Pablo Picasso's Maquette for Guitar (1912) appears absurd only when we look at it directly: the strings are torn and twisted, the neck is crooked, and the body is split into disconnected pieces. But now focus on the cross, while still paying attention to the guitar: all you can see is the smooth curves and elegant angles of a beautiful instrument. Pelli hypothesizes that the illusion works because our peripheral vision confuses the locations of the parts. Failure to notice the errors in the maquette produces the perception of a real guitar. Picasso's paintings of Nusch Éluard, a French acrobat, show a similar phenomenon. When viewed directly, the portraits are grotesque, but when seen peripherally, the young woman looks exquisite. Pelli suspects that Picasso was well aware of this effect. ||||| I just took a brief hallucination break with a colleague. We stepped into a supply closet, dimmed the lights, sat down, and watched one another’s faces morph into those of lionesses. I cried the whole time. Then we went back to work. We were testing out a theory, reported in IFL Science, that staring into someone’s eyes for ten minutes can have LSD-like hallucinogenic effects, and found that, whoa: Indeed it can. Giovanni Caputo, a researcher at the University of Urbino in Italy, paired up 20 people, had them stare into one another’s eyes in a dimly lit room for ten minutes, and reported on the results in Psychiatry Research. Caputo’s subjects reported some pretty strange effects, including out-of-body experiences and seeing monsters or dead people. So when my co-worker Lauren Brown arrived this morning, I asked her: “Can I look into your eyes for ten minutes?” “I thought you’d never ask,” she laughed. I set about approximating the conditions of Caputo’s study, which was a bit like creating a make-out room for a game of “Seven Minutes in Heaven,” only in my workplace. I dragged two chairs into a large closet and with a small desk lamp behind some boxes as the only source of light, made the room dim enough that I couldn’t perceive color, but was still able to discern details a few feet away from me. I put my phone on airplane mode and brought in Lauren. We sat down and set the timer. Dramatization of real events. (Quartz/Mia Mabanta) Lauren has a fairly intense gaze that’s symmetrically framed by striking, full eyebrows. The moment we sat down in the dark, that was the first thing that struck me, and then the giggles, which she got too. After a few long seconds, we settled into our places. I watched the smile fade from Lauren’s face, and felt sucked into her eyes. The bottom of her face started to elongate, and the highlights on her cheeks started to look like some kind of war paint or tribal markings. It occurred to me that she looked like a Native American chieftain. Then my phone fell off the camera bag it was sitting on, and smacked onto the floor. I broke our stare to pick it up and restart the timer. It had been about 30 seconds. We started again. Now we settled more quickly, and again I felt totally sucked into Lauren’s eyes, and very calm. I’m not much of a meditator—my earnest attempt with Headspace was rather short-lived—but I quickly fell into what I would call a meditative state. Thoughts floated in and out of my brain, but I felt like I was observing them, more than actively thinking them, like: Oh, that’s interesting. Now I’m wondering whether Lauren engages in facial contouring. Her cheekbones look so bright. Very early on, my left eye started to water. A tear filled it up and rolled down my cheek. I brushed it away, and then worried that may have distracted Lauren. Then another one came, and I just let it roll all the way down to my neck. Then my right eye started too. Was I forgetting to blink? I was blinking, but the tears didn’t stop. They didn’t feel like emotional tears, but more like the ones that stream down my face on windy winter days. But then, wait a minute. Was Lauren crying? It looked like her eyes were welling up, and it seemed like the corners of her mouth turned down. I felt there was a lot of emotion behind her eyes, and I just kept staring into them. Lauren has survived breast cancer, and it occurred to me that this could be a space where intense thoughts could creep in. A few minutes later, she giggled. Lauren’s chieftain face never came back, but her nose and mouth started to disappear, and were soon replaced with the muzzle of a large cat, like a mountain lion. (Seriously.) The whites of her eyes looked bright in the darkness, still framed by her eyebrows. The timer went off. “That went really fast,” I said. “That went so fast!” she agreed. We turned on the lights and stayed in the closet for a debriefing. “That was really fucking weird,” I said. She agreed. I asked if she noticed my eyes watering the whole time. She hadn’t. I told her I didn’t feel emotional at all, but the tears just wouldn’t stop. It made me think of the Marina Abramovic performance piece, The Artist is Present, in which many of participants cried when faced with the silent, sitting Abramovic. I told Lauren it looked like she was welling up a couple of times. She said she wasn’t at all. “I think you were projecting,” she said. Then she told me why she laughed halfway through our sitting. “You started to look like a weird little animal!” she said. “YOU started to look like an animal!” I shrieked. “A lion!” “You were a lion!” she yelled. “A lioness,” she corrected herself. We continued our very scientific analysis this way (unlike the subjects of Caputo’s study, who answered questions on a five-point scale, presumably not shrieking in a closet). Lauren also said my face faded into a black silhouette, surrounded by blue light—and that at one point, it occurred to her that my face, in the dark, looked like death. I tried not to take this personally. “But not like you were dead,” she said. We emerged from the closet, and I looked at Caputo’s study in detail. Other subjects, it turned out, had reported seeing animals (30%) or the face of someone of a differing race (7%). A striking 75% said they saw the face of a monster. No one reported projecting emotions onto their staring partner, but that may be because Caputo didn’t ask. Still, Lauren and my experience was probably more than a little different from those who participated in Caputo’s study—and not just because we were in a supply closet. We sat down as friends and colleagues who are comfortable with one another, not strangers. It made me think of The New York Times story (paywall) about falling in love with a stranger by answering personal questions while gazing into their eyes. I wouldn’t say Lauren and I fell in love, but we did share something quite cool: A perception-shifting experience; a quiet space to sit with our thoughts, away from the internet; and a lot of laughs afterward. What’s more, it only took ten minutes, it was free, and we have no hangover to show for it. I highly recommend finding a friend and a dark room, and taking ten minutes to try this out.

In the experiment, 20 participants gazed into each other's eyes in a dimly lit room for ten minutes. The majority of them reported strange effects, such as out-of-body experiences, seeing monstrous creatures, or deceased individuals. This phenomenon may be partly explained by Troxler fading and neural adaptation - the mechanism by which neurons decrease or stop their responses to unchanging stimulation.

Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump.

Both of these sentences refer to a small, singular particle of a larger substance. In these cases, \\"grain\\" is used as a unit of measurement to identify one small part of a whole. The word \\"grain\\" is used to indicate a tiny, individual piece of each substance – salt and sand. In the first sentence, \\"A grain of salt,\\" we are talking about one small crystal of salt.

In the second sentence, \\"A grain of sand,\\" we are talking about a small particle of sand. Sand typically consists of tiny fragments of rocks, minerals, shells, etc. A single \\"grain\\" of sand is one tiny, individual particle, which can be found on beaches, deserts, or other sandy environments.

In my opinion, it's better to improve it. Compared with He Garden, the map on the back of the ticket for He Garden is much clearer, more detailed and more useful. However, in the room that has the picture of the family members, there is only Chinese, no English, so my advice is to add English in interesting places. I got lost in the Slender West Lake. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice. Taking a taxi is the most efficient and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance. Maybe I was _ by the guy who rode for me, but it was an enjoyable ride. I felt like I was part of the garden city more. Over all I am satisfied with Yangzhou and will recommend it to others.

The context of the sentence seems to imply that the subject being described possesses qualities or characteristics highly-suited for a person who plays ball. In order to better understand the sentiment, it is essential to analyze the elements of the sentence. 1. Positive lexical choice: The adjective \\"perfect\\" conveys a sense of excellence or suitability, indicating that the person being described possesses qualities that align well with what is expected or desired from a ballplayer. By using the word \\"perfect,\\" the speaker or writer is expressing their admiration and appreciation for those qualities. 2. Subject focus: \\"For a ballplayer\\" suggests that the person in question is involved in sports, specifically ball games. This context emphasizes the positive sentiment, as the speaker seems to admire the individual's talents and abilities relative to that specific domain. 3. Comparative element: Although there is no explicit comparison made with other ballplayers, the sense of perfection implies that the individual stands out against their peers or others in the same field. This contrast serves to strengthen the positive sentiment being conveyed, as it highlights the exceptionalism of the individual being described. 4. Implication of recognition: The sentence hints at a level of acknowledgement or acclaim for the individual. The fact that the person is being called \\"perfect\\" suggests that they may have already achieved a measure of success or recognition within their specific sports domain, further emphasizing the positive sentiment. Based on these elements, it can be concluded that the sentiment of the sentence \\"so perfect for a ballplayer\\" is predominantly positive and appreciative. The expression highlights the individual's talents, skills, and achievements, making them stand out as exceptional and admirable in the context of their sport."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact: the amount of daylight is greatest on the summer solstice Question: Opposite the winter solstice, the summer solstice features What's the answer? Available choices: * longer daylight. * less daylight. * brighter fires. * more darkness.","completion":"The answer to the question, \\"Opposite the winter solstice, the summer solstice features,\\" is: * longer daylight. The summer solstice, which typically occurs around June 20th or 21st in the Northern Hemisphere and December 21st or 22nd in the Southern Hemisphere, marks the start of summer and the day with the longest period of daylight in the year. It is the point when the Earth is tilted most towards the Sun, resulting in the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky. This causes the day to have the greatest number of daylight hours and the shortest length of nighttime during the entire year. On the other hand, the winter solstice, which generally occurs around December 21st or 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere and June 20th or 21st in the Southern Hemisphere, denotes the official beginning of winter and the day with the shortest period of daylight. The Earth is tilted furthest away from the Sun during the winter solstice, causing the Sun to appear at its lowest point in the sky and the day to have the fewest daylight hours and the longest duration of nighttime throughout the year. The longer daylight during the summer solstice is caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis, which influences the angle and position of sunlight hitting the planet. During the summer solstice, the Earth's North Pole is tilted towards the Sun in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in more direct sunlight and longer daylight hours. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the Earth's South Pole that is tilted towards the Sun, causing the same effect of extended daylight. In contrast, the other available choices, \\"less daylight,\\" \\"brighter fires,\\" and \\"more darkness,\\" do not accurately represent the features of the summer solstice. \\"Less daylight\\" and \\"more darkness\\" are features of the winter solstice, while \\"brighter fires\\" is unrelated to the characteristics of the summer solstice, which is primarily known for its extended daylight hours."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the answer?","completion":"A Bellini cocktail is a classic and elegant drink that has been enjoyed by people all around the world since its creation in the 1940s. The Bellini was first invented by Giuseppe Cipriani, the founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy, and is named after the famous Italian Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini, as its color reminded Cipriani of the hue in one of Bellini's paintings. To make a Bellini cocktail, the fruit juice that is traditionally added to champagne is peach purée or peach nectar. Peach purée can be prepared by using fresh, ripe peaches. They are first peeled, pitted, and then blended or mashed until a smooth consistency is achieved. However, if fresh peaches are not available or are out of season, it is also possible to use high-quality store-bought peach purée or nectar. In the original recipe, Giuseppe Cipriani used white peaches, which were abundant in the region, and the sweetness and delicate flavor of these peaches contributed to the refreshing character of the drink. Generally, white peaches are preferred for making Bellinis due to their lower acidity and more subtle flavor compared to yellow peaches. To prepare a Bellini, the following proportions are typically used: - 2 parts Prosecco or Champagne (preferably chilled) - 1 part peach purée or nectar (chilled) Pour the peach purée or nectar into a champagne flute or wine glass and then gently top it off with the Prosecco or Champagne. To ensure that the drink maintains its beautiful color and does not become overly frothy, it's best to pour the sparkling wine slowly, allowing it to run down the side of the glass. Once the drink has been mixed, it's ready to serve and enjoy. Over the years, several variations of the Bellini have also been developed, featuring different fruit juices such as strawberry, mango, or even raspberry purées. Nonetheless, the peach Bellini remains the original and most iconic version of this cocktail, a perfect accompaniment for celebrations or simply when enjoying an indulgent, refreshing treat."},{"prompt":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Write an article based on this \\"The oil and gas industry has responded \\"strongly\\" to the latest offshore licensing round.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Robust Response to Latest Offshore Licensing Round Highlights Strength and Adaptability of Oil and Gas Industry Introduction The oil and gas industry has shown its resilience and adaptability once again, responding \\"strongly\\" to the latest offshore licensing round. This robust response demonstrates the sector's continued resolve to seek new opportunities for growth and innovation, despite the challenges faced in recent years due to market volatility, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing energy transition. In this article, we will be analyzing the factors that have contributed to this strong response and discuss the implications for the industry's future. Economic Factors Driving Strong Response 1. Growing demand for oil and natural gas: Despite a concerted push for renewable and alternative energy sources, the global demand for oil and natural gas has remained strong. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a temporary dip in demand, but as economies slowly recover, energy consumption is set to rise once again. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy needs will increase 30% by 2040, with much of this demand being met by oil and natural gas. 2. Advances in technology and cost-effective exploration: Over the years, the oil and gas industry has made significant strides in developing new technology and increasing the efficiency of exploration and extraction processes. This has allowed for access to previously unattainable, deeper resources and has significantly brought down the break-even costs of new projects, making these ventures more economically viable. 3. Encouraging national energy policies: Governments around the world are implementing incentives and providing support to the oil and gas industry in terms of favorable tax regimes, financing solutions, and streamlined regulatory procedures. These actions are designed to promote licensing round competition and provide a stable business environment, fostering more significant investment in the sector. Industry Dynamics and Competitive Landscape A greater focus on collaboration and alliance-building is another key factor behind the strong response to the licensing round. In the face of growing complexity and uncertainty in the market, companies have become more open to pursuing partnerships, joint ventures, and strategic alliances to share costs, risks, and technology resources. These collaborations help companies to leverage diversified strengths and facilitate access to new opportunities across borders. Furthermore, many large international oil companies (IOCs) are taking a step back from the traditional offshore oil and gas projects to focus on renewable energy sources. This has opened up opportunities for medium-sized and smaller companies to step in and take advantage of the offshore licensing rounds. The situation not only increases the number of stakeholders in the sector but also fosters innovation and market dynamism. Implications for the Industry's Future The strong response to the latest offshore licensing round signifies the vitality of the oil and gas industry and provides a glimpse of its potential trajectory in the coming years. Key takeaways that point to an optimistic future for the sector include: 1. The continued exploration of new opportunities and resilience of the industry in the face of market challenges. 2. The government and industry collaboration will help provide a conducive environment for investments and encourage further licensing round activities. 3. Partnerships and alliances built during the licensing round process will likely lead to more technological advancements and better management of project risks. 4. A more diversified competitive landscape can be expected as medium-sized and smaller oil and gas firms take on a more crucial role in offshore resource exploration. Conclusion In summary, the oil and gas industry's response to the latest offshore licensing round underlines its adaptability and commitment to pursuing growth opportunities in a rapidly changing energy market. The strong response demonstrates the sector's ability to manage risks and face challenges head-on and portends a bright future for the industry as it continues to explore and develop new energy resources to meet the world's ever-increasing demands."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From thousands of dollars in jewelry to one-of-a-kind designer outfits and a walk-in closet to boot, little Nori might just have the most lavish lifestyle of any one-year-old on the planet. According to US Weekly, the famous tot has over 200 pieces of designer clothing–some of which she’s never even worn. Items include a 375 silk Oscar de la Renta Dress, a 200 leopard viscose frock from Roberto Cavalli, an Alexander Wang leather dress and Giuseppe Zanotti custom-made shoes. And you know those little earrings North is always rocking? They’re a pair of 50,000 half-carat diamonds from “Kim and Kanye are grateful when designers send them some pieces,” a source tells the publication. “North loves clothes and getting ready to go out. It’s a lot of fun.” The parents are also building a walk-in closet in their new mansion to keep all of Nori’s pricey belongings safe, but they refuse to leave her stuff at home when they travel. Instead, they make sure to maintain the one-year-old’s lavish lifestyle wherever they are, buying five 940 Orbit Baby G2 strollers to keep at each of their most-visited places–including one in Paris, New York and at each one of Kim’s sisters’ homes. Kimye also makes sure their daughter’s all-white nursery and her 3,950 crib is “replicated wherever they stay,” the source claims. “All of North’s stuff is always waiting at the location they’re traveling to.” For example, on their recent trip to Paris for Fashion Week, Kim and Kayne booked North and her nanny their own penthouse suite at Le Royal Monceau to accommodate the baby’s needs.

Write a question about the following article: The violence and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton . The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them. The Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania, many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the presence of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin, who had helped organize the local militia, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. \\"If an Indian injures me,\\" he asked, \\"does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all Indians?\\" One leader of the Paxton Boys was Lazarus Stewart who would be killed in the Wyoming Massacre of 1778.

Write an article with the title: \\"Two Essential Investing Tips\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Two Essential Investing Tips Introduction Investing can be a daunting endeavor, especially for those new to the world of finance. However, mastering a few basic principles can significantly improve your chances of success. In this article, we will discuss two essential investing tips that everyone should keep in mind when entering the market. These tips will not only help you make well-informed decisions but also minimize potential risks. Tip 1: Diversify your investments One of the fundamental principles of investing is diversification. By spreading your investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographic locations, you can reduce the impact of a single poor-performing investment on your overall portfolio. Diversification helps to mitigate risks, while still providing the potential for healthy returns. Step-by-step process for diversifying your investments: 1. Analyze your risk tolerance: Your personal risk tolerance will dictate the degree of diversification you should pursue. A higher risk tolerance may allow you to invest in more volatile assets, while a lower risk tolerance should steer you towards more stable investments. 2. Choose a mix of asset classes: Diversification can be achieved by investing in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Each asset class has its own risk and return characteristics, so carefully weigh their pros and cons before investing. 3. Invest in different industries: Within each asset class, consider investing in a variety of industries. For example, if you are investing in stocks, make sure your holdings are spread across technology, healthcare, energy, and other sectors. This practice helps protect your portfolio from industry-specific downturns. 4. Diversify geographically: Globalization has made it easier than ever to invest in markets around the world. By investing in both domestic and international stocks or funds, you can achieve geographical diversification, further spreading your risk. 5. Rebalance regularly: Market fluctuations can cause your asset allocation to shift over time. Periodically reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio helps ensure that it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and overall financial goals. Tip 2: Conduct thorough research Thorough research is vital for making informed and prudent investment decisions. Before diving into an investment opportunity, understand the underlying factors, industry trends, and historical performance of the asset or company. Step-by-step process for conducting investment research: 1. Assess the fundamentals: For individual stocks, analyze the company's financial health, profitability, and future growth prospects. Review key financial ratios, income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements to understand the company's strength and weaknesses. 2. Understand the industry: Assess the health and competitive landscape of the industry in which the investment opportunity exists. Look for emerging trends, factors influencing demand, and potential challenges or disruptions that could impact future performance. 3. Evaluate management: Investigate the track record of the company's management team. Determine if they have a history of success, proven strategies, and well-defined goals for the future. 4. Compare against peers: Compare the investment opportunity against its peers to see how it stacks up in terms of financial performance, growth potential, and overall competitiveness. 5. Monitor news and updates: Keep updated on any news or developments related to the investment, as these events can significantly affect its value. Conclusion To maximize your potential for success in investing, remember these two essential tips: diversify your investments and conduct thorough research before making any decisions. By adhering to these principles, you can better navigate the complex world of finance and make more informed choices, ultimately securing a brighter financial future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: You will always see someone rubbing the part of a statue corresponding to an afflicted area in the hope of relief from pain and worry. Hypothesis: People believe in rubbing the statue in order to help with the pain. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that people are always seen rubbing the part of a statue that corresponds to their own afflicted areas with the hopes of experiencing relief from pain and worry. This observation suggests that an underlying belief exists among these individuals who practice this behavior, which is the hypothesis – people believe in rubbing the statue in order to help with the pain. The premise and the hypothesis are connected because the actions of these people imply a belief in the healing or pain-relieving powers of rubbing the statue. The premise observes a pattern of behavior, and the hypothesis provides a possible explanation behind this behavior. It is essential to note, however, that the premise does not provide direct evidence that the belief in question is universally held by all; rather, it suggests that this belief is common enough among those who partake in the practice. To further explore this connection, let's consider why people might believe in rubbing the statue to help with their pain. Various cultures and religions often practice rituals or exhibit behaviors that are believed to have healing properties, provide relief, or even work as a form of protection. It is not uncommon for people to hold beliefs, based on their cultural, religious, or personal belief systems, that certain objects, places, or acts can positively influence their health and well-being. In the case of rubbing the part of a statue corresponding to an afflicted area, individuals may believe that the statue possesses certain properties or spiritual energies that can be transferred to their ailing body part through physical contact. This belief might be rooted in ancient cultural or religious practices that attribute healing power to certain symbols, objects, or locations. Moreover, the psychological aspect of belief also plays a crucial role in this practice. The placebo effect, in which a belief in the effectiveness of treatment leads to actual healing or relief despite the treatment itself having no direct impact, could also be at play here. People who genuinely believe that rubbing the statue will help with their pain may experience relief simply because their mind is convinced it will work. In conclusion, the premise, which is the observation of people rubbing statues in hopes of relief from pain and worry, entails the hypothesis that people believe in rubbing the statue in order to alleviate their pain. This belief might be influenced by cultural, religious, or personal understanding and potentially reinforced by psychological factors, such as the placebo effect. The connection between the premise and the hypothesis lies in the understanding of the motivation behind people's actions, grounded in their belief systems and the potential healing properties attributed to such practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force. - A conscientious objector is an \\"individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service\\" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion. In general, conscientious objector status is considered only in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces. - The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Lemonade makes money through the use of a stand.\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, it can be concluded that \\"Lemonade makes money through the use of a stand\\" is a valid interpretation, but it is important to expand and clarify this statement further. In the context of the paragraph, it is clear that the focus is on making money easily, specifically for kids, through hosting a lemonade stand. The concept of a lemonade stand involves setting up a small, temporary stall in a neighborhood or public area where children can sell lemonade. This activity is popular, particularly during the summer months, when people are more likely to crave a refreshing cold beverage. Lemonade stands can be a fun and educational way for children to make money. They provide an opportunity for kids to learn essential skills such as communication, salesmanship, basic math, and even marketing as they promote their stand. They also offer a way for children to engage in a simple business venture, make a profit, and contribute to their community. Getting some friends together to participate in the activity can make it more enjoyable and help share the responsibilities and workload. Friends can team up and collaborate on tasks like making lemonade, setting up the stand, advertising the sale, and serving customers. Working together can increase the chances of attracting more customers and, consequently, making more money. Given the information provided, it can be concluded that hosting a lemonade stand is a popular way for kids to make money by selling lemonade. While the initial statement is somewhat accurate, a more detailed phrasing might be, \\"Hosting a lemonade stand allows children to make money with the help of their friends by making and selling lemonade in their neighborhood during the summer months.\\" This encompasses the original idea while also providing more context and specificity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: \\"the sun reflecting off of metal on a woman's purse.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Light is being reflected.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"Yes, the premise tells us that the hypothesis is true. In the given premise, \\"the sun reflecting off of metal on a woman's purse,\\" we are presented with a description of a specific event involving light. This description shows the interaction between sunlight and the metal surface on the woman's purse. Understanding the nature of light and its behavior when it comes in contact with different surfaces can provide insight into how this premise supports the hypothesis. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. When light encounters a surface, it can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected, depending on the properties of that surface. In this case, the surface in question is the metal on the purse. Metal surfaces are known for their tendency to reflect light. This is because metals have a high concentration of free electrons, which interact with the light waves and cause them to reflect off the surface rather than being absorbed or transmitted. With this knowledge, we can better understand the premise and its relation to the hypothesis. The sun, which is a source of light, shines on the metal surface of the woman's purse. The metal surface then reflects the light due to its aforementioned properties. This reflection of light is the main event described in the premise, and it is directly tied to the hypothesis: \\"Light is being reflected.\\" Hence, based on the understanding of light's behavior and the specific scenario described in the premise, we can safely conclude that the premise does indeed tell us that the hypothesis is true. The interaction between the sunlight and the metal surface on the purse results in the reflection of light, supporting the hypothesis that this event is taking place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The financial crisis is reminding Americans of a lesson they first learned in childhood: Share and share alike. They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically in communities across the Washington region and the nation. On one street in Arlington, for example, neighbors are collecting their separate money for mulch and dividing it among themselves.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Like an acoustic guitar, an electric is basically just strings that vibrate over wood, but with the addition of all kinds of confusing-looking selector switches and knobs. Learning to identify the basic components of electric guitars can help demystify the process and help you focus on the most important parts. Pick-ups will be placed under the strings near when the guitar is plucked. There may be as few as one pick-up and as many as three or four, depending on the guitar. These are used to pick up the sound of the guitar, which vibrates an internal magnetic coil, producing an electric signal that travels through the amplifier. Volume knobs will be included, sometimes as many as three. These allow you to adjust the output volume of the guitar. Tone knobs are used to toggle between the high and low frequencies in the pick-up. There are usually different tone knobs for each pick-up in the guitar. Selector or cut-off switches are used to select between the individual pick-ups and activate them, or cut them off. On most guitars you can use some combination of different pick-ups. The output jack is usually on the back-end of the guitar, or the bottom lip, where the guitar is plugged in to the amplifier via quarter-inch cable. To the untrained eye, all electric guitars might look basically the same, but body styles can be broken into several basic categories, each with its own subtleties of sound and playing style. Some body styles work better for certain genres, though there's no rule that says so. Lots of it has to do with your personal playing style and the music you want to make. Solid body guitars are sturdy and weighty, made of a single piece of wood. Because there's no resonance chamber, solid-body guitars must be played through amplifiers. The variety of pick-ups and the electronics of a solid-body guitar are very important. These are the go-to guitars for rock 'n roll, punk, and metal music. Famous solid-body guitar styles include the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Les Paul. Hollow body electric guitars are, as the name suggests, hollow on the inside of the body. While there's no sound hole as will be found on an acoustic guitar, hollow-body electric guitars will often use a different variety of pick-up than a solid-body guitar. These are often used for playing jazz, featuring a warm and deep mid-range, and work best with mellow, low-volume amplifiers. Semi-hollow body electric guitars are hybrid models that feature a cut-out design and a small hollow portion of the body. These guitars have a bright and chime-like tone that's perfect for country music, folk-rock, and for lead-guitar work. The Rickenbacker and the Gibson ES are famous semi-hollow guitar models. Electric-acoustic guitars look basically like acoustic guitars, but feature pick-ups that allow them to be played like electric guitars. While these typically will have fewer features than other forms of electric guitars, electric-acoustics offer the versatility of playing them without the use of amplification. Primarily, the sound of a given electric guitar will come from the pick-up, though the pick-ups of a guitar can be changed out, customized, and upgraded. For a reason, it's important to give some consideration to the wood that the guitar is made from, but beginners will likely not notice a huge difference in sustain, so try not to be led down a garden-path by a salesman telling you that you have to upgrade to koa wood. Still, it's good to learn a bit about the different types of woods used to demystify the process. Most bodies are made of maple, mahogany, or poplar. Maple is known for its long sustain and bright character, while mahogany is known for its warmth. Poplar is great for bright and crispy high-register tone. Let's face it, the number one reason most people end up picking the guitar they pick is because it looks cooler than all the others. This is a perfectly legitimate reason to pick a guitar. Almost every guitar player who ever picked up an axe did so because they saw some other guitar player who looked awesome standing on stage. Famous Gibson Les Paul pickers include Jimmy Page, Zakk Wilde, Slash, Randy Rhoads, and Bob Marley. Famous Fender Stratocaster players include Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Other iconic guitar models include the Gibson SG, played by Angus Young, the Fender Telecaster, played by Bruce Springsteen, the Gibson Flying V, played by Kirk Hammett, and the Fender Jazz Master, played by Kevin Shields, Elvis Costello, Thurston Moore, and J Mascis. Gearheads often fall into the same trap, thinking that super-expensive and obscure gear is also better than cheaper industry standard stuff. Sometimes, this is the case, but if you’re looking for a guitar to learn on, don't judge by the price. There are expensive guitars that have the resonance of a brick, and there are cheap guitars that really sing. Old Fenders that sell for thousands of dollars today started out life as inexpensive solid body guitars. By the same token, if you're going to invest in a guitar to learn on, you need to get something that's worth playing. Toy guitars sold at places like Walmart aren't even worth the low price tags offered. It's better to go for a used guitar or a cheaper model of the guitar you want. Fender offers the \\"Squire\\" series, using somewhat cheaper materials, but the same designs as their other more expensive guitars. You can get a Squire Strat for around 300, compared with the 1400 it might cost for an American Stratocaster, if you're lucky. Explore used guitars and do your research to find deals. Some players will only play guitars that have been broken in a bit and worked over by other players. Neil Young is known for only playing old guitars, for example, and never plays new ones.","completion":"The article provides a detailed overview of the different components and types of electric guitars, including their functioning, body styles, material used for construction, and their suitability for various music genres; it also offers advice on choosing a guitar, emphasizing not to base choices solely on the price, and includes information about famous guitar models and their renowned players."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He said: \\"The UK government has not announced any measures to address rising inflation and slowing wage growth which the IFS (Institute for Fiscal Studies) has described as dreadful. \\"As workers face more than a decade of lost wage growth and endure the worst period for pay in 70 years, does the Prime Minister think she's looking out for the just about managing?\\" Mrs May insisted that what was important was ensuring that \\"we have an economy which is increasing the number of jobs\\". She went on: \\"Because the best route out of poverty is for people to be in work, that is what we are doing. We've seen nearly three million more jobs being created over recent years, that's important for people. \\"We also help people for example by cutting taxes, it's exactly what we've done for people who are lower paid. Introducing that national living wage, these are measures that are giving people real help.\\" Mr Blackford raised concerns about in-work poverty, arguing that workers have \\"paid the price\\" for austerity. However, Mrs May maintained that the government's monetary policy had helped create jobs in the economy. Former investment banker Mr Blackford said: \\"Of course it's the forecast of a rise in in-work poverty that should concern us, in particular the likely increase of young people in poverty over the lifetime of this Parliament. \\"Since the 2010 general election, the FTSE has risen by 39.6%, monetary policy, not least quantitative easing has helped drive up financial assets while workers have paid the price for austerity. \\"Workers will earn no more by 2020/21 than they did in 2008.

Solve 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0 for a.","completion":"To solve the equation 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0 for a, we will follow the necessary steps for solving a linear equation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Combine like terms: The equation is given as 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0. In this equation, 8 and 4 are like terms because they are both constants. We can combine them by adding them together: 4*a + (8 + 4) = 0 4*a + 12 = 0 2. Isolate the variable term (a): Now we want to isolate the term with a to find its value. To achieve this, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: 4*a + 12 - 12 = 0 - 12 4*a = -12 3. Solve for the variable (a): At this point, the equation is 4*a = -12. We need to get the value of a by itself. To accomplish this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: (4*a) / 4 = -12 / 4 a = -3 So, the solution for the given equation 4*a + 8 + 4 = 0 is a = -3."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Title: Excellent Review: Ferry has researched his topic thoroughly, perhaps the only one worth lifelong investigation.

Johan and Peewit Answer:","completion":"Title: The Quest for Flatbroke's Castle Genre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family Plot: In the enchanted realm of Smurf Village, the lovable blue creatures live a carefree life under the watchful eye of Papa Smurf. One day, while recounting old tales to his fellow Smurfs, Papa Smurf tells the story of the long-lost Flatbroke's Castle. Long ago, it was the home of a wealthy but humble king, who was beloved by his subjects. Legend has it that the castle hides a treasure trove of gold and precious gems the king left behind when he vanished mysteriously during a storm. No one knows the whereabouts of this extraordinary castle, as it has been erased from the maps and hidden from sight for centuries. However, Papa Smurf reveals an ancient scroll he had discovered in his youth, containing a cryptic clue leading to Flatbroke's Castle. Overhearing the fascinating tale, the curious and adventurous Smurfs – Hefty Smurf, Clumsy Smurf, Smurfette, and Brainy Smurf – decide to venture beyond the village to uncover the truth hidden in the legend. To help with their quest, Papa Smurf sends Johan and Peewit, two brave and trusted human friends, to accompany the determined Smurfs in their search. As a team, they set out on a thrilling journey through enchanted forests, treacherous mountain paths, and mysterious caves. During their mission, the group faces various challenges posed by the evil sorcerer Gargamel, who too learns about Flatbroke's Castle and its hidden riches. Gargamel relentlessly pursues the Smurfs, hoping to capture them and seize the treasure for his selfish desires. As the unlikely heroes traverse the magical lands, they forge friendships with woodland creatures, which aid them in deciphering the cryptic clues that lead them closer to the hidden castle. With wisdom and cooperation, the team is successful in outsmarting Gargamel and overcoming the obstacles he sets for them. Finally, after a long and treacherous journey, Johan, Peewit, and the Smurfs find the entrance to Flatbroke's Castle. It is a breathtaking sight – an enormous, magnificent castle hidden in plain sight by powerful, protective spells. Within its walls, they discover the king's treasure, along with the truth about the castle's hidden location: the king had chosen to keep it a secret to protect his people from the greed and chaos it might bring. Understanding the wisdom of the long-gone king, the group decides to leave the treasure undisturbed and preserve the secret of Flatbroke's Castle. In the process, they learn the value of teamwork, friendship, and the importance of protecting the greater good over personal desires. The band of heroes returns to Smurf Village with their new bonds of friendship strengthened, taking with them only the incredible story of their journey and the lessons they garnered from the brave quest for Flatbroke's Castle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Context_1 : Captain Kidd (1645–1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy. Context_2 : The Indian Ocean Games Triangulaire was a triangulaire, or tournament between three teams, between Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar. It was the predecessor to the Indian Ocean Island Games. The triangulaire was held every year from 1947 until 1958, and then once more in 1963. In 1963, the last game, Mauritius vs Madagascar was abandoned in the 54th minute, which gave Madagascar the win that year. After that, Mauritius did not want to play Madagascar, and the tournament was not held. The Indian Ocean Island Games started in 1979 as a multi-sport event. In the football portion, Mauritius participated along with Réunion, Seychelles, Comoros, and the Maldives. Madagascar did not join until the second Indian Ocean Island Games, which was in Mauritius in 1985. The three triangulaire teams have been to every Indian Ocean Island Games since. Context_3 : Piracy in the Indian Ocean has been a threat to international shipping since the second phase of the Somali Civil War in the early 21st century. Since 2005, many international organizations have expressed concern over the rise in acts of piracy. Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses, costing an estimated 6.6 to 6.9 billion a year in global trade according to Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP). According to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy. Insurance companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as insurance companies hiked premium rates in response. Context_4 : The 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was the \\"least active\\" tropical cyclone season in the North Indian Ocean since 1993. Only two cyclone storms have formed throughout the year, far below the average of 4-6. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with peaks in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated \\"ARB\\" by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated \\"BOB\\" by the IMD. Context_5 : William Kidd, also \\"Captain William Kidd\\" or simply \\"Captain Kidd\\" (c.1654 – 23 May 1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. Some modern historians deem his piratical reputation unjust. Context_6 : Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Fantala was the most intense tropical cyclone of the south-west Indian Ocean in terms of sustained winds. Part of the 2015–16 cyclone season, Fantala formed on 11 April to the south of Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean. With a ridge to the south, the storm moved westward for several days while gaining strength, aided by warm waters and decreasing wind shear. Late on 17 April, the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) estimated peak 10-minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone of the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and the strongest on record in the south-west Indian Ocean. Context_7 : William Burke (d. 1699, first name occasionally Thomas, last name occasionally Burk, Burt, Bourck, Burch, or Burcke) was an Irish pirate and trader active in the Caribbean and near Newfoundland, best known for aiding William Kidd. Context_8 : John H. Blair (born 1887) was a Scottish sailor. During his early career, he worked aboard the Loch Line, which operated between Britain and Australia. He then joined a Melbourne shipping company, and worked the Australia-India trade. From 1913–14, Blair served as Chief Officer aboard the SY \\"Aurora\\", under John King Davis, during the final Antarctic voyage of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE). He later became Chief Executive Officer of Pangbourne Nautical College. Context_9 : Indian Ocean is the debut album from Indian Ocean. The band’s first album, recorded in just 10 days at HMV’s Dumdum studio, Calcutta, in December 1992. Shaleen Sharma played the drums on this album. This is the only album in which Shaleen Sharma was present; later when Shaleen Sharma left the band he was replaced by Amit Kilam. Released on cassette initially and later on CD. This was a purely instrumental album with only a line or two sung by Asheem. It was a fluid album and defined the true sound of Indian Ocean before they became more of a pop band. A total of 30,000 copies were sold, but it has the potential for a release and perhaps an LP version for a justice to be done to the crisp sound. Recording engineer for this album was Raja Mukherjee. Cover concept was done by Manas Chakrabarti. The graphic design work was done by Navin Shiromani. The Durgapal family gave \\"Indian Ocean\\" all their time, patience and space while Indian Ocean prepared for this recording. Context_10 : James Gilliam, also known as James Kelly, (died July 12, 1701) was an English pirate active in the Indian Ocean during the 1690s and was a longtime associate of Captain William Kidd. Prior to his association with Kidd, he sailed with George Raynor and Edward Davis aboard the \\"Batchelor's Delight.\\" One of Kidd's earliest crew members, Gilliam was a participant in the mutiny on board the \\"Mocha\\" and the subsequent murder of Captain Edgecomb who was killed in his sleep. After taking command of the East Indiaman, Gilliam and the \\"Mocha\\", under successive Captains Ralph Stout and Robert Culliford, assisted in the capture of several ships in the Indian Ocean. Gilliam was arrested after returning to New England with Kidd in 1699. Transported to Great Britain, he was tried at the Old Bailey and found guilty of piracy. While in prison, he wrote \\"A full and true Discovery of all the Robberies, Pyracies, and other Notorious Actions, of that Famous English Pyrate, Capt. James Kelly\\" which included references to the as yet undiscovered Galapagos Islands before his eventual execution on July 12, 1701. fact_1 : William Burke (d. 1699, first name occasionally Thomas, last name occasionally Burk, Burt, Bourck, Burch, or Burcke) was an Irish pirate and trader active in the Caribbean and near Newfoundland, best known for aiding William Kidd. fact_2 : William Kidd, also \\"Captain William Kidd\\" or simply \\"Captain Kidd\\" (c.1654 – 23 May 1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean.

Meanwhile, Alakananda (Tamanna), who is a staunch agnostic due to certain circumstances, along with her family is visiting Badrinath Temple, to which Badri is appointed as the protector. Her grandfather explains to Badri that she is in danger as Sarkar (Kelly Dorjee), a dreaded don, is trying to force her marriage with his son. On the request of her grandfather, Badri helps Alaknanda to gradually believe in God's existence. Eventually Alakananda falls deeply in love with Badri, unbeknownst to him, and is not willing to lose him at any cost. Sarkar and his men follow Alaknanda to Badrinath, and try to kidnap her.

This article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words?, what is it ? A:","completion":"Má vlast is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words. This work is a cycle of six symphonic poems, and it is considered a significant representation of Czech national music. Its musical ideas are bolder than anything Smetana had tried before, and it symbolizes the consummation of the national struggle of the time. Má vlast is a reflection of Smetana's growth as a composer, showcasing his ability to handle large-scale forces and demonstrate the latest musical concepts in a neo-Romantic style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Fix cracks in floor. Choices: (1). Fill in cracks with pen ink. (2). Melt same colored crayon and fill in cracks.","completion":"When attempting to fix cracks in a floor, it is important to consider the efficacy, durability, and aesthetic factors of the solution. In this case, both (1) filling in the cracks with pen ink and (2) melting a same-colored crayon and filling in the cracks are unconventional options. However, among the two choices provided, Option (2) - Melt the same colored crayon and fill in cracks - is the better solution for the following reasons: 1. Pen ink is generally thin and will not provide adequate filling for any floor cracks. The ink is likely to seep into porous surfaces such as concrete or grout, leading to uneven coverage and further staining the surrounding area. Additionally, pen ink can easily smear and spread, creating an aesthetically displeasing appearance and potentially staining the floor further. 2. Crayon wax, on the other hand, offers a more stable, semi-solid filling material when melted, which makes it better suited for filling in cracks. The wax will harden as it cools down, creating a relatively smooth surface that is more durable and longer-lasting than pen ink. 3. The use of same-colored crayon allows for a better match of the floor's color, ensuring a more consistent and visually appealing result. This color matching advantage is crucial in maintaining the aesthetics of the floor. Pen ink, typically available in a limited range of colors, is unlikely to blend well with the floor color, resulting in an apparent repair that may actually draw more attention to the crack. 4. Using melted crayon wax offers some degree of flexibility when repairing the crack. If the initial application does not yield the desired result, the crayon wax can be reheated and re-melted to create a smoother and more even finish. This makes it easier to achieve a satisfactory appearance. Despite Option (2) being comparatively better, it is important to note that neither alternative is a professional or ideal solution for fixing cracks in a floor. Consulting with a professional or using specialized crack repair materials (e.g., epoxy, concrete patch, or wood filler) would be recommended for a more effective and longer-lasting repair, especially in cases where the cracks might be indicative of severe structural problems. Such specialized materials are designed to properly bond to surfaces and provide greater durability, ensuring the repaired area remains protected and blends seamlessly with the surrounding floor."},{"prompt":"Definition: You are given a sentence in English.

A Reading statement said: \\"The search for a successor starts immediately. It is hoped a new manager will be in place as soon as possible.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Academy head Eamonn Dolan is in charge of the first team in the interim. The Royals also confirmed first-team coach Nigel Gibbs had also left the club he joined in 2006. McDermott joined Reading in 2000 as a scout/coach working under Alan Pardew and Steve Coppell. He was named caretaker manager in 2009 following the sacking of Brendan Rodgers, before being appointed permanent manager. McDermott just missed out on promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge of Reading, reaching the play-off final but losing 4-2 to Swansea City. However, a run of 15 wins from 19 games towards the end of last season secured the Championship title and the Royals' promotion to the top flight for only the second time in the club's history. In May 2012, Reading were taken over by Russian tycoon Anton Zingarevich, who acquired 51% of the club, and also announced a reshuffle in the boardroom. \\"I'm just hoping Reading don't end up in a similar situation Wolves find themselves. They sacked their manager before the end of last season, had an interim manager and this season they are near the bottom of the Championship. \\"It's a big decision for the new owner to make and it will be an even bigger decision replacing him.\\" Reading struggled for the first half of this season, winning only two Premier League games, but they showed signs of improvement in 2013 with four successive victories in all competitions, including two in the top flight, and McDermott was named the January manager of the month. However, defeats by Stoke, Wigan and Everton, followed before a 2-1 loss at home to relegation rivals Aston Villa at the weekend, left Reading 19th in the table, level on 23 points with bottom club QPR. Dropping out of the Premier League would mean the club would miss out on a share of a new TV deal worth about £5bn across three years from August. The Reading statement added: \\"[Reading] owner Anton Zingarevich wishes to place on record his thanks to Brian who had achieved great success with the club since taking over as Manager in December 2009. \\"Brian gained promotion to the Premier League last year for only the second time in the club's history thanks to a remarkable run at the end of last season. \\"However, in our current situation, owner Anton Zingarevich felt that a change was necessary.\\" Reacting to the news, Reading striker Noel Hunt wrote on Twitter: \\"Want to say thanks to Brian for everything he did for me especially.

McDermott, who joined Reading in 2000 as a scout/coach, had led the club to enjoy the Championship title and promotion to the top-tier league in the previous season, an achievement that marked only the second instance in the club's history. Despite the success of the past, Reading struggled in the first half of the current season, securing only two Premier League wins initially. However, some improvement was noticed in 2013 when the team logged four successive victories in all competitions and McDermott was named January's manager of the month. Unfortunately for the club and McDermott, subsequent defeats led to a drop in league standing that threatened Reading's share in a lucrative TV deal worth about £5 billion over three years. In the wake of McDermott’s departure, the academy head Eamonn Dolan took over the first team on an interim basis, and the club began the search for a new manager. The move came at a crucial time as the Reading team was struggling with their place in the league and also facing potential financial consequences. The club’s first-team coach, Nigel Gibbs, has also left the club. The owner of Reading, Anton Zingarevich, expressed thanks to McDermott for his service since taking over as manager in 2009 and for the feats he accomplished with the club.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) We caught up with Baier to discuss how this event came together, what he plans to ask and if he thinks anti-Donald Trump Republicans would vote for Clinton in the general election. TheWrap: How did Fox News get Hillary Clinton to agree to this? Baier: We've been working for a while. I had invited Secretary Clinton to this town hall originally. Sen. Sanders did agree a couple of weeks ago and confirmed, but we were told originally Clinton had a scheduling conflict and it wasn't going to happen. We had Thursday night's debate in Detroit, and then Friday got word that the Clinton camp wanted to see if it was still possible to happen, and they had reconsidered. Right before my show at 6 p.m., we got confirmation that she would take part. I don't know what was the impetus for the change, but we're very happy that she's here, and to have both Democratic candidates in the town hall on the No. 1 cable news station is great. Sanders and Clinton had a debate last night in Flint. What still needs to be answered before tomorrow's Michigan primary? First of all, there are a couple of things in those exchanges last night that we could potentially follow up on. There are topics that have not been talked about or discussed on the Democratic side as of yet. Hopefully we'll get to some of those. I'll ask a few questions and then we have 300 Michiganders, mostly undecided Democratic voters, but there are a few who are independent and actually deciding between Trump and Sanders. There are a couple deciding between Rubio and Clinton. This is an open primary in Michigan, so we have an out of great questions that have not been asked yet. Also Read: Surprise: Clinton Joins Sanders in Call For Michigan Governor's Resignation -- After Her Camp Said She Wouldn't Will you question Clinton about calling for Michigan's Gov. Rick Snyder to resign during last night's debate, after her spokesperson said she wouldn't do that during the pre-debate coverage? [Laughs] Maybe. I don't want to reveal too many of the questions ahead of time but I think there are things to follow up on from last night. Also Read: Why the GOP Perception of Fox News Doesn't Impact Viewership Do you think Clinton will use an appearance on Fox News to appeal to anti-Trump members of the GOP as she looks forward to the general election? I don't know. You'd have to ask the Clinton campaign of the calculation. I will say that there are an amazing amount of Independents and Democrats and Republicans who watch Fox, if you look at all the breakdowns as of late of our viewership. One would think that any campaign would want to hit the biggest audience in cable news. And as you get closer to the general election, I assume that factors into the equation.

Solve this instance: Context: Sequential events of endometrial tumorigenesis can be studied by comparison of genetic lesions seen in normal, premalignant, and malignant tissues. The distribution of k-ras mutations in microsatellite stable and unstable premalignant lesions was studied to determine whether this gene is implicated in both tumorigenic pathways.', 'K-ras mutations were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing in matched endometrial normal, premalignant (atypical hyperplasias), and adenocarcinoma tissues from individual patients. Identification of precancers solely by their appearance as atypical endometrial hyperplasias is very subjective; therefore, in addition to histopathological assessment, we performed molecular testing (non-random X inactivation or clonal altered microsatellites) for an expected feature of precancers--that is, monoclonality.', 'Equivalent K-ras mutation frequencies were seen in microsatellite stable (six of 33) and unstable (three of 23) cancers. In both types, K-ras mutation in monoclonal precancers usually corresponded to a change from normal to an equivocal (two of 12) or hyperplastic (10 of 12) histology. Divergent K-ras genotypes among multiple neoplastic tissues of individual patients (two of six patients) are exceptions explained either by multicentric premalignant disease, or acquisition of K-ras mutation late in neoplastic progression.Question: Do k-ras mutations appear in the premalignant phase of both microsatellite stable and unstable endometrial carcinogenesis?

Options: - city - shoes - apartment building - town - london The answer is:","completion":"Apartment building. In order to find a very nice flat, the most suitable option among the given choices would be an apartment building. Apartment buildings are specifically designed to house multiple residential units, which often include flats as one of the available living spaces. When searching for a nice flat, an apartment building presents several advantages. Firstly, these buildings typically offer a variety of flat sizes and floor plans, catering to a wide range of tastes and preferences. This variety allows potential renters or buyers to choose a flat that best suits their specific needs and requirements. Secondly, apartment buildings usually come with certain amenities that may not be available in standalone houses or flats in quieter residential areas. Such amenities may include gyms, swimming pools, laundry facilities, and in some cases, even shopping centers or cafes on the premises. These conveniences not only enhance the living experience of the residents, but they also contribute to the overall appeal of the flat. Thirdly, apartment buildings are oftentimes located in prime locations within cities or towns, providing easy access to public transportation, job opportunities, schools, restaurants, and entertainment venues. This strategic positioning adds a layer of convenience for the residents, as it reduces the time spent on daily commuting and offers a more vibrant and connected lifestyle. It is important to note that while apartment buildings are the most suitable option to find a nice flat among the given choices, there are other factors to consider when searching for a perfect living space. For instance, the desired neighborhood, budget constraints, and personal preferences will all play a crucial role in determining the ideal flat. Although some other options like cities, towns, and London might also be potential places to find nice flats, these choices represent broader geographic locations rather than a specific type of housing. Consequently, opting for an apartment building narrows down the search to a more specific setting, where the probability of finding a superb flat is substantially higher. In summary, an apartment building is the most suitable option for finding a very nice flat, given its unique advantages such as a wide variety of floor plans, access to amenities, desirable locations, and higher likelihood of meeting specific living requirements compared to other options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _ Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

Translate to Finnish","completion":"Ajatelkaa vain Euroopan neuvoston yrityksiä poistaa asetuontikieltoa Kiinaa vastaan tai sitä tapaa, jolla Euroopan kauppavaltuuskunnat ovat toistensa tiellä Kiinassa nykyään. Euroopan neuvosto on pyrkinyt aktiivisesti kumoamaan nykyisen asetuontikiellon, joka on ollut voimassa Kiinaa vastaan vuodesta 1989 lähtien. Tämä kielto asetettiin alun perin vastauksena Tiibetin mielenosoitusten väkivaltaiseen tukahduttamiseen sekä Tiananmenin aukion verilöylyyn. Euroopan neuvosto on pitänyt tämän asetuontikiellon yllä erilaisilla perusteilla, kuten huoli ihmisoikeuksista ja alueen vakauden turvaamisesta. Miksi Euroopan neuvosto on sitten kiinnostunut muuttamaan nykytilannetta? Yksi keskeinen tekijä on taloudellinen etu. Euroopan unionilla on runsaasti asetuotantokapasiteettia, ja se toivoo pääsevänsä vahvemmin mukaan Kiinan kasvavaan ja potentiaaliseen asekauppamarkkinaan, joka on maailman toiseksi suurin. Samalla tämä voimaantullut asevienti voi avata ovet uusille teknologia- ja teollisuusyhteistyömahdollisuuksille. Toinen tekijä on se, että Euroopan unioni haluaa tämän avulla tiivistää diplomaattisia ja poliittisia suhteitaan Kiinaan, joka on yksi maailman suurimmista talouksista, sen kasvavan vaikutusvallan vuoksi kansainvälisellä areenalla. Kiina on myös yksi Euroopan unionin tärkeimmistä kauppakumppaneista ja investoinnin houkutteleva kohde. Kuitenkin tämä lähestymistapa ei ole herättänyt innostusta kaikkien jäsenmaiden keskuudessa. Itse asiassa monet Euroopan maat kilpailevat keskenään Kiinan markkinoille pääsystä, usein tarjoamalla erilaisia ehtoja ja sopimuksia. Tämä on johtanut Euroopan kauppavaltuuskuntien välisten ristiriitojen syntyyn, jossain määrin hankaloittaen yhteistyötä ja yhtenäisen lähestymistavan luomista. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Euroopan neuvoston pyrkimykset kumota asetuontikielto Kiinaa vastaan ja Euroopan kauppavaltuuskuntien välinen kilpailu Kiinan markkinoilla ovat herättäneet paljon keskustelua ja erimielisyyksiä. Tässä tilanteessa on tärkeä tunnistaa ja sovittaa yhteen eri jäsenmaiden edut ja huolenaiheet sekä ymmärtää vaikutukset, joita näillä päätöksillä voi olla laajemmin kansainvälisten suhteiden ja turvallisuuden saralla."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: At least 24 people in 13 countries have been arrested in a US-led sting operation targeting illegal trafficking of credit card information.","completion":"Title: International Crackdown on Credit Card Trafficking Brings 24 Arrests across 13 Countries Introduction In a major coordinated effort to tackle the ever-growing problem of credit card information theft and trafficking, at least 24 individuals across 13 countries have been detained in a US-led sting operation. This large-scale crackdown shows the continued push by law enforcement and governments to protect consumers and businesses from the devastating effects of cybercrime and fraud. In this article, we delve into the details of this recent operation and explore the implications for the ongoing fight against digital criminal activities. The Operation The operation was a result of close collaboration by law enforcement agencies in 13 countries, with the United States at the helm. Agencies involved in the sting operation included the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Europol, and various police departments from countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The primary aim of the operation was to target those engaged in the illegal trafficking of stolen credit card information, a crime that has seen a sharp uptick in recent years due to the increasing reliance on digital payment methods. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement officials were able to identify and apprehend suspects involved in the unauthorized access and sale of financial data, leading to the arrest of 24 individuals across multiple continents. Over the course of the operation, officers not only arrested individuals but also undertook an extensive search and seizure of electronic devices and equipment used in conducting these nefarious activities. Furthermore, the coordinated efforts of law enforcement also led to the identification and mitigation of numerous digital forums and dark web sites, used by the criminals to exchange stolen financial data, effectively disrupting a significant portion of this illegal trade. Challenges and Results One of the primary challenges the operation faced was the growing use of the dark web and encryption technologies by criminals for the purpose of hiding their digital footprints. The suspects used these advanced tools to engage in their illicit activities, making it increasingly difficult for law enforcement to track, monitor, and gather evidence. Despite these challenges, the operation has demonstrated the potential for international collaboration in the war against cybercrime, reinforcing the importance of sharing information and resources to detect and prosecute those responsible. The 24 arrests have caused a significant dent in the illegal trafficking of credit card information, and raise awareness of the strides being made by the global law enforcement community to eliminate such financial crimes. The Future of Combating Credit Card Trafficking As cybercrime continues to evolve and grow in complexity, so too must the efforts to combat it. The recent US-led operation sends a powerful message to criminals engaged in credit card information theft and serves as a stark reminder that law enforcement agencies worldwide are honing their skills and enhancing their capabilities to counter these digital threats. This crackdown is just one example of the ongoing battle against cross-border cybercrime and reinforces the importance of international cooperation and intelligence sharing among various countries. It is clear that by combining their efforts, law enforcement agencies can achieve better results in addressing and dismantling these sophisticated criminal networks. Conclusion The international operation that led to 24 arrests across 13 countries marks a significant victory in the fight against illegal trafficking of credit card information. However, this success should not be viewed as the end of the struggle—instead, it should be considered as a stepping stone towards further collaboration and innovation in the battle against cybercrime. As technology advances and criminal networks become increasingly sophisticated, law enforcement must continue to adapt and improve its strategies and tactics, working together in a united effort to protect and serve the global community against the scourge of credit card theft and fraud."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Similarly, in sentence (2), the removal of 'the' before 'Davis Studio' does not alter its meaning. However, these are stylistic differences and do not change the meaning of the overall sentences. Both sentences convey that the person studied at these two locations, thus they have the same meaning.

If \\"Two smiling children in bathing suits jumping in a tidal pool at the beach.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A couple of humans near water.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Two smiling children in bathing suits jumping in a tidal pool at the beach\\" logically supports the premise that \\"A couple of humans near water.\\" To further elaborate, let's break down the statement: 1. Two smiling children: This clearly defines that there are two human beings who are children, and they are expressing happiness through their smiles. 2. In bathing suits: This piece of information tells us that the children are dressed appropriately for an activity involving water (such as swimming or playing), suggesting they are in close proximity to a body of water. 3. Jumping in a tidal pool: This part of the statement confirms that the children are interacting with a body of water, which in this case is a tidal pool. A tidal pool is a pool of seawater that is near the beach and is usually found along rocky coastlines where water is collected during high tide. 4. At the beach: This information reveals the location and establishes that the humans are next to a larger body of water (usually the ocean or the sea). With this information, we can infer that the original statement implies the presence of \\"a couple of humans,\\" in this case, two children, who are indeed \\"near water,\\" since they are engaged in an activity at a tidal pool on the beach. The use of the term \\"couple\\" also signifies the presence of two individuals, which aligns with the count of children in the original statement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The bodies were found in three vehicles that were crushed by fallen concrete panels in the Sasago tunnel, about 80km (50 miles) west of the capital Tokyo. A fire broke out after the tunnel caved in on Sunday, and a number of survivors fled to safety on foot. The usually busy tunnel remains closed, as police are investigating potential negligence. There will be serious questions about how a major tunnel on one of Japan's most important traffic arteries could have failed so catastrophically, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Tokyo reports. The private company that runs the highway has said the tunnel was given a major inspection just two months ago and was given a clean bill of health, our correspondent adds. In pictures: Japan tunnel collapse Emergency workers said that five bodies were recovered from a van early on Monday. They were identified as three men and two women, all in their twenties and from Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported. Another woman, aged 28, who had been in the vehicle survived. Three bodies were found in a car and another body in a lorry. The driver of the lorry had reportedly telephoned for help from inside the 4.3km (2.7 miles) twin-bore tunnel - one of the longest in Japan. Part of the tunnel collapsed at 08:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday). Thick black smoke was seen billowing from the tunnel, hampering rescue efforts. Pictures from closed circuit TV cameras inside the tunnel later showed a section of up to 100m (328ft) that had caved in on the Tokyo-bound lanes on the Chuo Expressway in Yamanashi prefecture. A reporter for public broadcaster NHK described driving through the tunnel as it began to collapse, seeing other cars trapped and on fire. His car was badly damaged, he said. Another survivor told the broadcaster that he saw \\"a concrete part of the ceiling fall off all of a sudden when I was driving inside. I saw a fire coming from a crushed car\\". Survivor Tomohiro Suzuki said: \\"A part of the ceiling, just as wide as the road, had collapsed straight down and broken in the middle into a V-shape.\\" He and his family walked for an hour to get out, with the smoke worsening. \\"I heard after a while on the public address system that a fire had occurred inside the tunnel and the sprinkler system was going to be activated,\\" he told Jiji Press. \\"I kept wondering when the fire would spread and catch us,\\" Mr Suzuki said. Japan is prone to large earthquakes, but none was reported in the area at the time. Some experts have said that structural failure may be to blame - but this has not been confirmed by the authorities. Summary:","completion":"There was a big tunnel in Japan called the Sasago tunnel. One day, some parts of the tunnel fell down and crushed 3 vehicles. People found 9 people who couldn't make it out, but some others were able to run to safety.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

Question: Upon meeting who, Adams and Franklin are quite taken? Movie title: 1776 Movie plot: While General George Washington is conducting the struggle against the British Empire on the battlefield, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia piddles away its time over trivial matters and continually refuses to begin debating the question of American independence. The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement (these conversations are based on letters between the couple). Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence (with Dickinson framing it as \\"treason\\"). Weeks later, Lee returns with the resolution, and debate on the question begins. However, in the midst of debate, Caesar Rodney falters because of his cancer and is taken back to Delaware by fellow delegate Thomas McKean, leaving the anti-independence George Read to represent Delaware. After heated discussions, the question is called without a majority of positive votes present. The New Jersey delegation, led by Reverend John Witherspoon, arrives just in time to provide a vote supporting independence. In a move intended to defeat the resolution, Dickinson calls for a vote requiring unanimity for passage. The vote ends in a tie between the colonies, New York abstaining as it does in every vote.

Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence. In this sentence, we are comparing the organization of a drawer and a shelf. Step 2: Identify the correct option. There are two options provided: - shelf had been been attention. - drawer had been been attention. Both options have a repetition of the word \\"been,\\" which is likely a typo and should be removed. The main difference between the options is whether the shelf or the drawer received attention. Step 3: Choose the appropriate option based on the context. Since the sentence begins by stating that the drawer was more organized than the shelf, it makes sense to choose the option that says the drawer had been given attention. That is because giving attention to organizing the drawer would lead it to be more organized. In contrast, if the shelf had received attention, the shelf would likely be more organized instead. So, the correct choice is \\"drawer had been given attention.\\" Step 4: Insert the chosen option into the original sentence.

Given the below context: Alan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 – 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works. Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the BBC in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany. In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years. During and after the war he began to simplify this style, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the mass of the people. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and...

Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson.

It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their loveâhate dynamic.

I removed beef from my diet and added pork, as the OPTIONS: A). beef turned out to be unhealthy.; B). pork turned out to be unhealthy.;","completion":"I removed beef from my diet and added pork, as the beef turned out to be unhealthy. The decision came after I started doing some research on the environmental and health impacts of various meats. I found that not only was beef production contributing to a massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but it was also a significant source of cholesterol and saturated fat. At first, I was hesitant to make the change, but then I discovered the numerous benefits that pork provided. From the nutritional aspect, it boasted high-quality proteins, vitamins, and minerals while being relatively low in sodium and calories. As an added bonus, certain cuts of pork, such as tenderloin and loin chops, were considered lean meats. This meant they had less fat and cholesterol content than their beef counterparts. Moreover, I found that the environmental impact of pork production was considerably lower than beef, which appealed to my ecological conscience. Rearing pigs required fewer inputs like water, feed, and land, and produced less methane emissions per kilogram of meat than cattle. This meant that by switching to pork, I was able to reduce my carbon footprint without sacrificing my love for flavorful meats. Of course, making this lifestyle change did not come without its challenges. One of the first hurdles I had to overcome was developing a new set of recipes and cooking techniques. Since pork was leaner than beef, it was crucial to learn different ways of preparing it to avoid dry, overcooked meals. Fortunately, the versatility of pork allowed me to experiment with several cooking methods like roasting, slow cooking, grilling, and pan-frying. As I began to research and try out different pork recipes, I discovered a wide range of dishes from all around the world. Some of my favorites included American pulled pork, Chinese char siu, Italian porchetta, and German schnitzel. This culinary journey not only introduced me to various flavors and cooking styles, but also helped broaden my understanding of different cultures through the lens of food. Another challenge I faced was dealing with the social aspect of switching to pork. Family and friends who were fond of beef raised their eyebrows at my newfound choice. But rather than debating about the merits of each meat, I decided to showcase the deliciousness of pork through potlucks, barbecues, and dinner parties. The dinners were a success, and soon, even the most steadfast beef lovers were surprised at how much they enjoyed the pork dishes. It was also a fantastic opportunity to educate others about the health and environmental reasons behind my decision, resulting in some of my friends reevaluating their own dietary choices. Gradually, pork became an integral part of my culinary life, and the transition from beef to pork was smoother than I had initially anticipated. The benefits I experienced ranged from improved health, reduced environmental impact, and cultivating a more diverse palate. With the variety of flavors, cuts, and global recipes available, I find my meals much more satisfying and enjoyable. In conclusion, removing beef from my diet and embracing pork was one of the best decisions I've made in terms of both personal health and environmental consciousness. The journey has been a dynamic and enriching experience, and I am glad to have made the switch. I believe that it's essential to stay informed about the impacts of our food choices, and being open to change will ultimately lead to improved well-being for ourselves and the planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: James was printing on his printer and the paper got stuck. Then when it was unjammed, he had to clear what? Possible A: ink, noise, use paper, hard copy, queue Why is \\"queue\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Queue\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it directly addresses the issue that arose when James' printer experienced a paper jam. A queue, in the context of printers, refers to the list of pending print jobs waiting to be executed by the printer. When a printer experiences an issue like a paper jam, the print jobs may not be completed in the order they were received or may be halted altogether, requiring the user to clear the queue and reissue the print commands. To better understand why \\"queue\\" is a sensible answer in this scenario, let's briefly analyze the other options presented: 1. Ink: While a paper jam could potentially cause ink-related issues, such as ink smudging or cartridge misalignments, the primary concern after resolving a paper jam is to ensure that the printer can resume processing print jobs effectively. Clearing the ink is more relevant to correcting an ink-related problem and is not directly related to the paper jam or resuming print jobs. 2. Noise: While printers can undoubtedly make noise when they encounter an issue such as a paper jam, the noise itself is not something that James would have to clear or address after unjamming the paper. Noise is merely a symptom of the problem and not the issue that needs to be resolved. 3. Use paper: \\"Use paper\\" is a somewhat vague and unclear option. It doesn't directly address the paper jam issue or the process of resuming print jobs. It may be related to the idea of replacing or refilling the paper supply, but that is not the primary concern after a paper jam is resolved. 4. Hard copy: A hard copy refers to a printed document, and clearing a hard copy is not relevant to the paper jam scenario. After unjamming the paper, James' focus would be on ensuring the printer can continue with the pending print jobs, not clearing a specific hard copy. In conclusion, \\"queue\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it directly addresses the primary concern after a paper jam – ensuring that the printer can resume processing the list of pending print jobs effectively. Clearing the queue will help James get his printer back on track and continue printing without further issues, whereas the other options do not address the main concern as effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having left out David Warner because of an incident in the early hours of Sunday, Australia made 243-8 as Adam Voges struck 71 and George Bailey 55. New Zealand were 51-2 when rain arrived after 15 overs, five overs short of the number needed for a result. As a consequence, England will qualify for the semi-finals if they beat Sri Lanka at The Oval on Thursday. The abandonment favours New Zealand, who beat Sri Lanka on Sunday, rather more than Australia, who were well placed in this contest after losing their opening Group A match to England. It was yet another difficult day for Mickey Arthur's team ahead of the Ashes series which begins on 10 July. Captain Michael Clarke remained in London having treatment on a long-standing back injury, and there was further disruption to the squad - this time self-inflicted - as details emerged of Warner's alleged \\"unprovoked attack\\" on England batsman Joe Root in a Birmingham bar, which resulted in the Australia opener being placed on 12th-man duties to carry drinks of a different kind. This followed the 26-year-old's recent fine for comments made on Twitter, and four members of the squad being disciplined over \\"Homework-gate\\" during the 4-0 whitewash in India this year. Australia 85 wins, New Zealand 34, no-results 6 Their run of ill fortune briefly abated when Australia won the toss but soon returned as two wickets fell in the first 19 balls. Shane Watson edged to wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi, the New Zealand-born former Australia player, to give Mitchell McClenaghan the first of four wickets. Phil Hughes was run out for a duck by a Martin Guptill direct hit after hesitation between the batsmen, and Daniel Vettori bowled tidily with great variations of flight and pace to concede just 23 runs in 10 overs, despite a troublesome Achilles that left him hobbling in the field. Stand-in Australia skipper Bailey played with an effectiveness that was particularly commendable given the trying circumstances surrounding his team. Unspectacular both in shot selection and demeanour, Bailey calmly restored order in a partnership of 64 with Matthew Wade and then 77 in 16 overs with the purposeful Voges. 8 - Mitchell McClenaghan (NZ) 7 - Ravindra Jadeja (Ind) 7 - Ryan McLaren (SA) 5 - Sunil Narine (WI) In his 18th ODI, 33-year-old Voges - yet to play a Test and not part of the Ashes squad - struck the ball crisply in a 76-ball innings that ended in the 44th over when he drove a McClenaghan full toss to short extra-cover. Glenn Maxwell added an enterprising unbeaten 29, featuring the only two sixes of the innings, both of which came in the penultimate over, bowled by spinner Kane Williamson. It took Australia to a total that had been overhauled only three times in 20 previous ODIs at the ground. With the floodlights on in the increasing gloom, New Zealand's task became more difficult when Guptill sliced Clint McKay to point in the fourth over and Ronchi - who played two ODIs for Australia in 2008 but who now has only 45 runs in five innings for the Kiwis - steered the same bowler to gully. But rain intervened and the match was finally called off at 18:23 BST, meaning reigning champions Australia must beat Sri Lanka in their final match on Monday to have any chance of continuing their defence of the trophy.

This comprehensive examination aims to assess workers' experiences, work environment, and related factors in order to determine the extent of the alleged labor violations occurring in these factories. The inspection process will cover various facilities in different locations across China, including those operated by Foxconn in both Shenzhen and Chengdu. This approach is necessary to allow the FLA to gain an accurate understanding of the working conditions and practices faced by employees in companies that collaborate with Apple. Following the examination, the FLA's findings will be compiled and analyzed to determine any patterns or systemic issues that may exist in these suppliers' operations. In cases where violations are identified, the FLA will work with Apple and the suppliers to develop strategies and plans to address the issues found. This process will help ensure the protection of workers' rights and foster a healthy work environment within the supply chain. Furthermore, the FLA's involvement in this investigation serves as an external validation of Apple's commitment to maintain and improve labor rights and work conditions in its supply chain. Moving forward, Apple's willingness to cooperate with the FLA sends a strong message to other technology corporations – emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability when it comes to labor practices. In conclusion, the most logical option to complete this passage is by stating that the FLA is planning to interview thousands of employees at several Apple suppliers. This inspection process is crucial in understanding the current situation and developing strategies to improve the working conditions within the companies that produce Apple's iPads and iPhones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This sentence is correct in terms of grammar, structure, and syntax. Let's break down this sentence to understand why it constitutes a valid English sentence. 1. Word arrangement: The given sentence follows the basic English word order, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This arrangement adheres to the proper syntax that enables clear communication in English. Subject (S): \\"I\\" - The subject in the sentence is the speaker who performs the action. In this case, the speaker is the one telling the story. Verb (V): \\"told\\" - The verb in the sentence describes the action being performed by the subject. In this instance, the verb is \\"to tell\\" (in the past tense), which denotes the act of narrating or conveying. Object (O): \\"the story\\" - The object in the sentence is the entity that is receiving the action or being affected by it. Here, \\"the story\\" is the subject matter that the speaker is communicating. 2. Prepositional phrase: The sentence also includes a prepositional phrase, which provides additional information about the action or relationship between the words in the sentence. Preposition: \\"to\\" - The preposition \\"to\\" is used in this context to indicate the recipient of the action. Object of the preposition: \\"Daniel\\" - The object of the preposition conveys who is affected by or involved in the action; in this case, \\"Daniel\\" is the individual to whom the story is being told. 3. Tenses: The verb \\"told\\" is the simple past tense of the verb \\"to tell,\\" which is appropriate in this sentence, indicating that the action of telling the story has already taken place. In conclusion, \\"I told the story to Daniel\\" is indeed a valid English sentence in terms of grammar, structure, and syntax. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object order, and it employs a suitable prepositional phrase that conveys additional information regarding the action. Furthermore, it correctly utilizes the simple past tense, creating a coherent and unambiguous statement that a linguist would deem grammatically correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The few paying jobs he had during his lifetime included mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and American Army officer.

Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - A mountain man is a male trapper and explorer who lives in the wilderness. Mountain men were most common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various Emigrant Trails (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized wagon trains traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the mule train based inland fur trade. - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,274. The majority of the population of the town lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada, about south of Reno. The town originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was the county seat of Ormsby County. In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory was merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.

Premise: A girl and a guy shop for records in a music store. Hypothesis: Some kids look for records at a music store. Step 2: Determine whether the hypothesis statement can be logically derived from the premise. The premise tells us that there are a girl and a guy who are shopping for records in a music store. The hypothesis states that some kids are looking for records at a music store. Step 3: Compare the two statements and identify possible logical connections. The two statements both involve people searching for records at a music store. The premise specifically states that these individuals are a girl and a guy, while the hypothesis refers to them as kids. Step 4: Assess if the connection between the statements is strong enough for a conclusion. Though the premise and hypothesis both mention individuals looking for records at a music store, the premise does not specify the ages of the girl and the guy. We cannot inherently assume that the girl and the guy are kids. Conclusion: Given the premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis, since the premise does not explicitly state the ages of the girl and the guy. However, it is possible that the girl and the guy are kids, but we would need additional information to confirm this."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: The Woodsman Movie plot: Walter (Kevin Bacon), a convicted child molester, returns home to Philadelphia after serving 12 years in prison. His friends and family have abandoned him, with the exception of his brother-in-law, Carlos (Benjamin Bratt). Walter's apartment is just across the street from an elementary schoolâan obvious source of temptation. He gets a job at a local lumber mill and meets Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), one of the few women working there. After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying \\"I didn't hurt them.\\" Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond to it, Walter tells her to leave his apartment. Walter receives frequent visits from a suspicious, verbally abusive police officer named Lucas (Mos Def). Lucas makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames \\"Candy\\" (Kevin Rice), is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is a bird watcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy; however, he does not report this to the police. Walter's life takes a further downturn when a suspicious co-worker, Mary-Kay (Eve), learns of his conviction and alerts the entire mill. Some of the employees attack Walter, but Vicki and the boss of the mill come to his defense. Ostracized and frustrated, Walter leaves his workplace and goes to the park. Vicki, fearing the worst, begins to search for him. Walter ends up meeting with Robin at the park. As they talk, he begins to succumb to his desires and invites Robin to sit on his lap. She politely refuses, but then begins to confide in him. As she begins to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father.

Denmark boss blames Christian Eriksen for lack of impact in defeat. Cristiano Ronaldo's late header sealed win for Portugal in Euro 2016 tie. Morten Olsen says Eriksen should have improved more at Tottenham. Eriksen admits he wasn't near his best during the Portugal defeat. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Denmark Boss Casts Shade on Christian Eriksen Amidst Euro 2016 Defeat by Portugal The national manager of Denmark's football team, Morten Olsen, has publicly criticized star player Christian Eriksen for his sub-par performance in Denmark's recent loss to Portugal in the Euro 2016 tie. Cristiano Ronaldo's late header sealed the victory for Portugal, propelling his team to a position of strength and marking a disappointing defeat for the Danes. Olsen appeared evidently frustrated as he highlighted Eriksen's unsatisfactory impact during the vital match. It is unusual for a leader to single out a player so directly, but Olsen opted for candid commentary rather than sugar-coating his feelings. The Danish manager believes that Eriksen should have shown significant improvement during his tenure at Tottenham Hotspur, one of the English Premier League's most renowned clubs. Olsen's words indicate his expectations for Eriksen to leverage his experience and learning from the English club onto international stages such as the Euro 2016. \\"Christian Eriksen was nowhere near his best. It's more than a year since we last saw him play as we know he can,\\" Olsen rued during the press conference, referencing Eriksen's previous notable performances for the national team. To his credit, Christian Eriksen was forthright in acknowledging his lackluster showing during the match against Portugal. He admitted that he wasn't in top form, which was ostensibly evident in Denmark's decreasing attacking prowess during the game that ultimately led to a victory for Portugal, thanks to a late header from Cristiano Ronaldo. Both Olsen's criticism and Eriksen's self-admittance reflect the high standards and expectations placed on the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder's shoulders. As a crucial component of Denmark's national team, Eriksen's form often dictates the team's results. Eriksen's lack of impact in a key match like the Euro 2016 tie certainly didn't go unnoticed. Moving forward, Eriksen will have to shoulder the burden of criticism and match it with an improved performance in Denmark's future fixtures. Whether this public critique by Morten Olsen will help or hinder Eriksen’s future performance depends on how well he can transform the critique into motivation, instead of a stumbling block. Will this spur him to elevate his game, or will it add pressure that could influence his future performance negatively?

Will Donald Trumps campaign performance, actions, and purported business dealing hurt his future business dealings? TIN number registration expenses? Do those questions have the same meaning? Possible answers: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"To determine if Donald Trump's campaign performance, actions, and purported business dealing will hurt his future business dealings, I will analyze the potential impact of these factors on his business reputation and opportunities. Step 1: Assess the impact of Trump's campaign performance on his business reputation. - His campaign was marked by controversy and polarizing views. This might have alienated some potential business partners, but at the same time, it has raised his public profile and potentially attracted others who support his political stances. Therefore, the impact of his campaign performance on future business dealings could be mixed. Step 2: Evaluate the potential consequences of actions taken during the presidency for his businesses. - Some policies enacted during Trump's presidency might have positively or negatively affected certain industries or markets. The long-term effects of these actions on his future business dealings will depend on the specific policies and their impacts on industries he is involved in. Step 3: Consider the role of purported business dealings in shaping Trump's business reputation and opportunities. - Allegations of unethical business practices, if proven to be true, could hurt his reputation and discourage potential partners. If such allegations remain unproven or are disproven, their impact on his future business opportunities might be minimal. Upon evaluating these factors, I conclude that the answer to the first question is not a simple yes or no, but rather, it depends on the extent to which the different aspects of his campaign, actions, and business dealings affect his reputation and opportunities. Regarding the question about TIN number registration expenses, this is a completely unrelated question and does not have the same meaning as the first one.

Massachusetts and Vermont resume tax refund payments after fraud concerns Massachusetts and Vermont have started to release tax refunds that were held for more intense review in recent days because of widespread reports of fraudulent filings tied to TurboTax. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue said it has cleared more than 113,000 of the 160,000 returns it set aside for additional scrutiny last week and sent refunds to those taxpayers. Of the more than 45,000 returns still under review, about 7,500 have been set aside as problematic and in some cases will require additional proof of identity before they are released. In Vermont, state officials are slowly sending out refunds, but some residents are likely to get paper checks instead of electronic deposits, to further reduce the likelihood that money is going to criminals, said Mary Peterson, the state’s tax commissioner. Criminals who file fraudulent returns typically request direct deposit of the refunds to debit cards, which are difficult to trace, Peterson said. “We may need that last backstop,” she said. Concerns about an increase in fraudulent returns, especially those filed through TurboTax, a popular tax-preparation software, caused an early disruption to the tax season. About 18 states across the country, from Georgia to Utah, last week reported a significant increase in fraudulent state tax returns. Federal tax filings were not affected. The problems forced TurboTax, which is used for about 30 million state returns each year, to temporarily halt processing state tax filings last Friday as it investigated the situation and whether it was the victim of a data breach. Intuit, the California software firm behind TurboTax, said it had not been hacked. Instead, company officials blamed large-scale security breaches of retailers and hospitals in the past year for making consumer information, such as Social Security numbers, readily available to cybercriminals, who use it to file fraudulent tax paperwork. Intuit, however, put additional security in place for TurboTax users, including multiple levels of authentication to identify filers. The FBI is investigating the fraudulent filings. Vermont has so far stopped 136 suspicious returns, compared to 88 at the same time last year, Peterson said. In many cases, state examiners are finding that criminals got access to residents’ tax paperwork from last year and are using that information to file fake returns, she said. Vermont usually has two tax workers reviewing individual returns, But this year, 14 are processing the filings, which will probably mean delays in refunds, Peterson said. In Massachusetts, an official said, some residents will get letters requesting more information to confirm their identities before refunds are released. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses how Massachusetts and Vermont have resumed tax refund payments after they were halted due to fraud concerns. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue and Vermont state officials began releasing tax refunds that had been held for more intense review due to widespread reports of fraudulent filings connected to TurboTax. Over 113,000 of the 160,000 returns that were set aside for additional scrutiny have been cleared in Massachusetts, while Vermont officials are gradually sending out refunds. Some taxpayers in these states are likely to receive paper checks rather than electronic deposits to reduce the likelihood of funds going to criminals. Criminals who file fraudulent returns often request direct deposit of refunds to debit cards, which can be difficult to trace. Concerns about the increase in fraudulent returns, particularly those filed using TurboTax, led to an early disruption of the tax season. About 18 states across the US reported a significant uptick in fraudulent state tax returns. However, federal tax filings were not affected. TurboTax, a popular tax-preparation software that handles around 30 million state returns annually, temporarily stopped processing state tax filings due to the situation. The company behind the software, Intuit, investigated whether it was the victim of a data breach but found that it had not been hacked. Instead, officials blamed large-scale security breaches at retailers and hospitals in the past year for making consumer information, including Social Security numbers, accessible to cybercriminals. These criminals used the data to file fraudulent tax paperwork. After additional security measures were put in place for TurboTax users, including multi-level authentication to identify filers, the company resumed tax refund payments. The fraudulent filings are currently being investigated by the FBI. At the same time, state examiners in Vermont have discovered that criminals accessed residents' tax paperwork from the previous year to file fake returns. Due to the increased scrutiny and additional processing, taxpayers in Massachusetts and Vermont may face delays in receiving their refunds.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) . - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys. What entity does 'chilecebus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

The US firm will separate its better-performing computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and services operations. Shareholders will be given a stake in both businesses. The split is part of a radical restructuring plan, which has already resulted in tens of thousands of job cuts in recent years. Investors cheered the news, sending HP's shares up nearly 5% in early trading on Wall Street. The firm is now in the fourth year of its five-year turnaround plan, aimed at helping the firm adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing. Current chief executive Meg Whitman, who has the job of reviving the fortunes of the 75-year-old firm, will head the new spin-off, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP's printing and PC business, HP Inc, which last quarter accounted for about half its revenue and profit. Ms Whitman said the split would give both firms the \\"flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics\\". \\"We can [now] more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,\\" she added. HP said it expected the division to be complete by the end of the 2015 financial year. Analysts said it was still unclear how the split would help HP to compete against its rivals, and whether the two divisions would ultimately end up competing with one another. \\"Both operations have seen declining revenue, and many are likely to question whether independence can change their fortunes,\\" said Arnaud Gagneux at analyst firm CCS Insight. \\"The cost of the separate marketing, finance and purchasing departments for the two entities will increase HP's spending, and the loss of some economies of scale may affect HP when purchasing components.\\" However, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said that separating into two companies would give HP the option to sell off one or even both businesses if an attractive offer was made. The division of HP's businesses comes at a time when other large tech firms are being urged to break up. Last week, online auction site eBay announced it was splitting off its payments system PayPal into a separate company. HP has been under pressure from newer rivals such as Chinese firm Lenovo, which overtook HP as the world's largest PC maker in 2012. Third-ranked US rival Dell was taken private last year.

While scoring his unbeaten 104, Symonds displayed a fine mix of defensive and attacking cricket. He cautiously dealt with the Pakistani bowlers, who were in good form that day, and punished the loose deliveries by smashing them to the boundary. As his innings gained momentum, he upped the ante and further shifted gears, taking the opposition by surprise and swinging the game's balance back in Australia's favor. As the Australian batting lineup struggled earlier in the innings, the importance of Symonds' knock cannot be overstated. It was his ability to dig deep and produce a match-defining innings that propelled Australia to a strong total of 269 runs in their 50 overs – a target that put considerable pressure on the Pakistani batsmen.

Low viscosity leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions. and the situation: John visited Sicily to see Mount Etna eruption. He noticed that magma there formed rhyolite. He was so excited to an eruption that when next time Kilauea eruption started in Hawaii, he went to see that. He found that unlike Etna Kilauea eruption formed basalt.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? To what degree do snow chains damage your tires or car? What is better for driving in snow, AWD or front wheel drive with snow tires?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They address two different aspects of driving in snowy conditions. Question 1: To what degree do snow chains damage your tires or car? This question focuses on the potential negative impacts of using snow chains on your tires or car. Snow chains are specifically designed to provide additional traction when traveling in snowy or icy conditions, and are typically mounted on the drive wheels of a vehicle. The question aims to understand what degree of damage, if any, can be caused by using snow chains. Answer: Using snow chains correctly may cause minimal wear and tear on the tires, which is generally considered acceptable considering the benefits they provide in terms of safety and maneuverability in challenging winter conditions. Snow chains can cause damage, however, if they are not installed correctly, are poorly maintained or used improperly. Any of these factors can lead to debris and chain components coming loose, causing damage to the tires or other parts of the car. To minimize any potential damage, the best approach is to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and usage, maintain the snow chains in good condition, and practice driving with them at appropriate speeds and in suitable conditions. Question 2: What is better for driving in snow, AWD or front-wheel drive with snow tires? This question seeks to understand which option is better suited for traversing snow-covered roads: all-wheel drive (AWD) or front-wheel drive equipped with snow tires. AWD and front-wheel drive are types of drivetrain systems, while snow tires are a type of tire specifically designed for snowy conditions. Answer: There isn't a definitive answer to this question as the suitability of either option might depend on the specific driving conditions and individual preferences. Here are some factors to consider for each option: 1. All-Wheel Drive (AWD) - AWD provides power to all four wheels, allowing for better traction and control in slippery conditions. This can help maintain grip in snow, as well as on ice, sand, and mud. AWD is advantageous in situations where roads are consistently covered or have significant snowfall. However, it is important to bear in mind that AWD may not provide a significant improvement in stopping distance or braking performance compared to front-wheel drive, which might still necessitate the use of snow tires. 2. Front-Wheel Drive with Snow Tires - Front-wheel drive vehicles typically handle better on slippery surfaces than rear-wheel drive vehicles, as the engine's weight is concentrated on the front wheels. Combining front-wheel drive with snow tires can improve traction and handling in snowy conditions. Snow tires are specifically designed to maximize grip on ice and snow. The main advantage of this option is that the use of snow tires can significantly improve braking performance, which is crucial for drivers in snowy or icy conditions. In conclusion, the choice between AWD and front-wheel drive with snow tires depends on various factors such as the type of roads, local weather conditions, budget considerations, and personal preferences. All-wheel drive has its advantages for consistently snow-covered roads and providing improved traction, while the combination of front-wheel drive and snow tires can greatly improve overall handling and stopping distances in wintry conditions. It is important to make an informed decision based on location, driving habits, and the demands of local weather conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(II) mustard was already expired.","completion":"The pesto in the store was not as delicious as the mustard, because the pesto was already expired. This caused it to lose its freshness and vibrant flavors, which are essential components that make pesto enjoyable and appetizing. Mustard, on the other hand, remained a better option for consumers due to its unexpired status and therefore managed to retain its tangy and bold taste. When store-bought pesto expires, it goes through some changes in texture, aroma, and flavor. Its once bright green color may turn into a dull, unappetizing shade, and the fresh basil scent diminishes gradually. Additionally, the oil present in pesto can become rancid, imparting an off-putting taste to the sauce. Nutritional degradation can also occur over time, which reduces the health benefits of the ingredients used in creating pesto. Comparatively, mustard provides a unique, strong flavor that pleases the palate, mostly by retaining its pungency and thickness when adequately stored and unexpired. Mustard seeds are ground and mixed with various ingredients such as vinegar, water, salt, and other seasonings to give it its distinctive flavor. Due to the presence of vinegar and other natural preservatives in mustard recipes, it usually has a longer shelf-life than pesto, allowing it to maintain its taste for more extended periods. To enjoy the best of both pesto and mustard, it is essential to pay close attention to the expiration dates of the products. Choosing fresh and unexpired sauces will ensure the most delicious and satisfying culinary experience. In the situation described, the expired pesto is unable to hold its own against the unexpired mustard, resulting in a clear preference towards the mustard as a condiment and flavorful ingredient."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of Wolfgang Mozart's father? from the following article ? In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about the relationship between US and Canada after Trump met with Canada's leader?

Article: Acute kidney failure is usually diagnosed in people who are already hospitalized. However, if you’re not in the hospital, have a common underlying cause of kidney failure, and experience symptoms, you’ll need to see a doctor immediately. Common causes of acute kidney failure include injury, blood clots, urethral blockages, severe dehydration, drug overdose, alcohol abuse, and infection. Symptoms of kidney failure include urination changes (such as producing little or no urine), fatigue or sluggish movements, metallic taste in your mouth, pain between your ribs and hips, seizures, and swelling due to water retention, especially in your legs, ankles and feet. Your doctor will need to perform tests to diagnose the underlying cause. They’ll then clear a blockage or clot, administer antibiotics, or take other steps to treat the underlying condition. While treating the underlying cause, you’ll receive medication to help control your fluid levels and blood potassium. During and after treatment, you’ll need to eat more healthy carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables. You’ll also need to limit the amounts of protein, salt, and potassium in your diet. High protein foods include red meat, poultry, and eggs. Instead of these, you’d need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and foods that are high in fiber, like brown rice, lentils, and raspberries. You’ll also need to swap high potassium foods, such as bananas, oranges, and potatoes, for low potassium options, such as apples, cabbage, grapes, green beans, and strawberries. Always read the label on prepackaged and processed foods to make sure you’re not eating things with high amounts of sodium. Some people who experience acute kidney failure require dialysis, which is a procedure that filters blood when your kidneys can’t function. It’s often only temporary, but cases of severe kidney damage might require long-term dialysis. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"Acute kidney failure can occur due to a variety of causes such as injury, blood clots, severe dehydration and alcohol abuse, among others.

He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room.

The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest. Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangzê was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \\"Head of British Mission Lhasa\\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat. However, it has been argued that the campaign had \\"a profound effect upon Tibet, changing it forever, and for the worse at that, doing much to contribute to Tibet's loss of innocence.\\" Answer this question: How many years did these events span for?","completion":"These events happened over a long time.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Should McDonald's Give Charles Ramsey A Reward For Heroism? Just what is McDonald's McDonald's trying to accomplish by involving itself in the horrible story of three young women held captive for over a decade in a Cleveland house? The fast-food behemoth says it wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the heroic neighbor who kicked apart a door to free Amanda Berry, helped her call 911, and then gave a vivid, witty, and ultimately viral account of what happened to a local TV reporter. Explaining his sudden acts of heroism, Ramsey noted that he was “eating my McDonald’s” when he heard shouting from his neighbor’s house and sprang into action. McDonald’s came up in the 911 call too. McDonald’s says it is responding to an outpouring of social media requests that it honor or reward Ramsey somehow. Well, OK. But really, it’s the most tenuous of connections. Had Ramsey been eating a kruller from Dunkin’ Donuts, texting on a Samsung phone, or playing an XBox game (or all of those things) at the time Berry started yelling for help, would those respective corporations be expected to queue up to laud him? This is treacherous territory, because McDonald’s cannot be seen as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes. And yet, it’s not really clear it can completely avoid that. Basking in the reflected light of Ramsey’s heroism may be one step removed, but one step removed is still pretty damn close. There are also issues of class lurking underneath the surface here, given the nexus of cheap-tasty-unhealthy fast food and the public health problems that lower-income communities face. Food corporations are desperate to promote public health and lighten up their menus. Giving Charles Ramsey a lifetime supply of Big Macs helps no one. But giving him a lifetime supply of Fruit and Walnut Salads might be seen as opportunistic or patronizing. (Unless he happens to really, really like McDonald’s Fruit and Walnut Salads.) And during a time when corporations are taking on more quasi-public functions, from slapping their names on stadiums and running prisons and municipal agencies, this only shows the limits of the trend. Really, it’s the community – the city of Cleveland – that should take the lead in formally thanking and honoring Ramsey. Ramsey, to his credit, has promised to give any reward money to the three kidnapping victims. But that only means that McDonald’s would be better off donating directly, and quietly, to any funds set up for that purpose, and stepping back. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook. My Forbes blog page is here. Summary:","completion":"McDonald's wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the man who heroically rescued three kidnapped women in Cleveland, after he mentioned he was eating McDonald's when he heard the commotion and sprang into action.

The agreement between the two iconic studios was aimed at curbing the competition for top digital animators by preventing bidding wars, as reported by the Christian Science Monitor. The secret agreement, as per the Department of Justice's complaint, entailed that both the companies would notify each other when offering jobs to employees of the other company. Furthermore, the agreement prevented the companies from making counteroffers that were higher than the initial offer made. The chief of the DOJ's anti-trust department, stated that this agreement \\"restrained competition for digital animators without any justification and distorted the competitive process.\\" The animation industry is renowned for its highly skilled professionals who contribute significantly to bringing life to some of the most iconic characters and stories on the big screen. Given the immense value and creative potential of such animators, it is not surprising that recruitment practices in this industry have been an area of concern for the Department of Justice. This settlement comes in the wake of six other technology firms, including Pixar, agreeing to put an end to similar recruitment practices earlier this year, as noted by AP. The termination of such agreements ensures that creative professionals in the digital animation industry have the opportunity to fairly explore their options and are compensated in accordance with the market value of their skills. Stifling competition in an industry as dynamic and innovative as animation can have adverse effects on the evolution and growth of the medium. By ensuring a healthy degree of competition, companies like Lucasfilm and Pixar will be encouraged to continue pushing the boundaries of what digital animation can achieve, without resorting to unscrupulous recruitment practices that restrict the market. The settlement between Lucasfilm and the Department of Justice is an important step towards promoting fair competition and enabling the growth of the digital animation industry. It will allow creative talent to be recruited based on merit, while ensuring they receive appropriate compensation for their skills. Moreover, it will ensure that the quality and diversity of the work produced in this industry remain a testament to the incredible creative potential of digital animators.

Read this article and answer this question Following their third loss of the season, the Indianapolis Colts entered their home game against the Cincinnati Bengals with a chance to regain the lead in the AFC South. Indianapolis came out energized in the first quarter where the Colts picked up a field goal with three minutes remaining in the quarter, and a Kelvin Hayden interception returned for a touchdown. The second quarter continued to see Colts dominance with a Javarris James touchdown run, extending the Colts lead to 17-0. However, as the quarter wore on the defense began to allow larger gains and the Bengals were able to score a touchdown and a field goal in the last ten minutes of the half. However, an Adam Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 20-10 lead going into halftime. The Colts came out in the third quarter sluggish and both teams exchanged the ball throughout the rest of the quarter. Another Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 23-10 lead. With everything seeming secure, the Bengals were able to pick up a touchdown on a 19-yard pass from Carson Palmer making it a six-point game. The Bengals onside kick attempt was successful with a late penalty by the Colts, giving the Bengals the ball at the Colts 40-yard line. A fumble, the fifth turnover by the Bengals on the day, gave the Colts the ability to hold on to the lead and win the game 23-17, going to 6-3 on the season and taking first place in the AFC South by one game. Who scored the first points of the second half?","completion":"The first points of the second half were scored by Adam Vinatieri.

Question: what is a synthetic conduit? Would \\"Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"A synthetic conduit refers to an artificially-engineered structure or device designed to serve as a functional replacement for a natural biological pathway or structure, often for the purpose of medical therapeutics or research. These man-made conduits can be composed of either organic or synthetic materials, with the objective of mimicking the properties of the original structure, such as mechanical strength and biocompatibility. The statement \\"Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively.\\" is a reasonable answer to the question but can be expanded upon for a more detailed and comprehensive explanation. Biologic tubes, as the statement mentions, are made from organic materials such as blood vessels and skeletal muscles. These conduits serve as natural solutions for restoring or replacing damaged or compromised biological structures. For example, the use of autologous blood vessels, like veins or arteries, in coronary bypass surgeries helps restore proper blood circulation in patients with coronary artery disease. Similarly, skeletal muscles can be fashioned into tubes and used to reconstruct hollow organs, such as the esophagus or urethra. In situations where biologic materials are not suitable or readily available, synthetic conduits can be an alternative. These artificial structures can be made from a variety of materials based on the requirements for their specific application. Examples of synthetic conduits include nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable materials: 1. Nonabsorbable synthetic conduits: These are made from materials that remain in the body for an extended period without disintegrating or being absorbed. Silicone is a common material for nonabsorbable conduits due to its flexibility, biocompatibility, and resistance to degradation. It has been used in various medical applications, such as catheters, implants, and vascular grafts. 2. Bioabsorbable synthetic conduits: These conduits are made from materials that eventually break down and get absorbed by the body over time. One such material is polyglycolide, a biodegradable polymer that has been used in diverse applications such as sutures, tissue engineering scaffolds, and medical meshes. Bioabsorbable conduits are particularly advantageous in cases where their presence is only required temporarily, allowing the body to gradually assimilate the material once its function has been accomplished. To summarize, a synthetic conduit is an engineered device or structure with the purpose of replacing or recreating biological structures or channels. The use of both biological and synthetic materials, such as blood vessels, skeletal muscles, silicone, and polyglycolide, provides a range of options for the creation of these conduits. Each material type has specific advantages based on their application and functional requirements, making them essential tools in modern medicine and research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What type of mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota?, using the article: Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis. The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry. Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In 1900, the type of mills that were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota were flour mills, specifically those utilizing advanced milling technology such as the middlings purifier and roller mills. These innovations allowed Minneapolis millers, including Pillsbury and Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills), to dominate the industry. The power from the Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River contributed significantly to the growth and development of these flour mills in the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp. Present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress. Another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it's name, is a custom made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. Once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it. In this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the blood stained letter in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the film's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband. The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off. Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle. The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonius' Argonautica. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers. Several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible's tale of Cain and Abel, and the vulgate tale of Romulus and Remus. As for the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. Winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes. Now, what is this review like? OPT: (a). negative. (b). positive.","completion":"This review is (b) positive.

Rolfe first examined the bedroom that he had seen Inspector Chippenfield enter. It was a small room, containing a double bed. It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does rain do to exposed soil?\\" with the following options: - It decreases - moves - contamination - protect them - Damages it - It expands - Movement - evaporation Answer:","completion":"Rain plays a significant role in the process of erosion, particularly when it comes to exposed soil. Based on the two facts provided, we can infer the following about the effects of rain on exposed soil. Fact 1: Rain causes erosion. Erosion is a natural process where water, wind, or other agents wear away soil, rock, and other surface materials. Rain, being a key factor in erosion, contributes to the breaking down and moving of soil particles from one place to another. As rainfall hits the ground, it dislodges soil particles which are then carried away by the flow of water, either over the surface or through various channels in the soil. Fact 2: Sediment exposed soil is susceptible to erosion by wind and rain. Exposed soil is soil that is not protected by any form of vegetation or cover. Without any such protection, exposed soil is more vulnerable to the eroding forces of wind and rain. The lack of vegetation leaves the soil's surface loose and susceptible to being washed away by flowing water or blown away by wind. Given these two facts and the options provided, the most appropriate answer to the question \\"What does rain do to exposed soil?\\" would be: - Damages it Rain damages exposed soil by causing erosion, which dislodges and carries away soil particles. Due to the lack of protection from vegetation, the soil is more susceptible to rainfall and wind, resulting in a higher likelihood of erosion. Additionally, when soil particles are moved from one place to another, it can lead to the deterioration of the soil structure, resulting in negative consequences for plant growth, water infiltration, and soil fertility. In summary, rain damages exposed soil through the process of erosion, breaking down and moving soil particles, and leaving the land less stable and fertile. This not only affects the natural environment but also has far-reaching implications for agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to implement proper soil conservation practices to minimize the harmful effects of erosion on exposed soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 19:37 EST, 16 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 02:07 EST, 17 January 2014. A report has found that of the 1.8m single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work. Posed by models. Britain has more single parents than almost any country in Europe, and almost one in three of them are unemployed. A report has found that of the 1.8million single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work. This has led to a situation where the average single parent household in the UK claims twice as much in benefit support as the average two-parent household. The proportion of lone parent households in the UK is the fourth highest in the EU - behind only Estonia, Latvia and Ireland - with 24 per cent of of children being brought up by just one adult. The think tank Policy Exchange, which compiled the study, said the figures showed that if George Osborne wants to slash the welfare bill, he needs to target support at helping young, single parents find work. Author Matthew Tinsley said: ‘Raising a child is a huge responsibility regardless of your living arrangements. All parents - especially young single mothers - need support. ‘It is right that the government extended free childcare. However, it is also right to ask more from people to find a job. Simply relying on benefits when you are physically and mentally able to work is not fair. ‘Policymakers must do more to help the two thirds of a million unemployed single parents find a job. Such action would significantly boost the UK economy and help find further savings in the welfare budget.’ The report found that the level of unemployment among single partners can partly be attributed to when they had children. More than half (52 per cent) of lone mothers who had their first child as a teenager are not in work or looking for work, compared to 40 per cent who had their first aged 20 to 23.

Among those who have their first child in their early thirties, the unemployment rate is 19 per cent. However, there has been an increase in the number of single parents in work compared to the 1990s, partly due to employment support and stronger job search requirements introduced by the previous government, and the increase in part-time work. The most common age single parents had their first child is 20 compared to couples who are together who most often had their first child at 30.

Former Long Beach Executive Director Toby Rothschild, now a policy wonk in Iwasaki's outfit, agreed. \\"To some extent, I did look at it and say, 'We are the littlest kid on the block, and we don't want to get beat up so we need a bigger protector,'\\" Rothschild said. \\"Once we got past that, it became a real positive for the Long Beach program and Long Beach clients.\\" But to the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley legal aid program, the positives of merging with Dudovitz's program, San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services, were never obvious. A meeting in late 1999 between Dudovitz and the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program's board showed how little the two programs had in common and how difficult bridging the gap between their ideologies would be, Dudovitz recalled. Although no merger plans were discussed, board members at the smaller program knew of Dudovitz's preference for impact litigation over direct services. \\"We had a discussion about what our separate views were,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"The message we got was that they wanted their program to stay as it was.\\" Lauralea Saddick, former executive director of the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program, said her board simply did not share Dudovitz's desire to spend money influencing social policy and participating in high-profile litigation over poverty-related issues. \\"Our board's philosophy was that the money given by the federal government was to help people with basic everyday needs,\\" Saddick said. \\"It might take a little bit of humility to take those kinds of cases. Impact work is very important ... but what was the good of getting the law changed if no one is there to help the individual?\\" Before the San Gabriel program was subsumed by Dudovitz's group, it offered to merge with the Legal Aid Society of Orange County. The boards of both organizations eschewed impact litigation in favor of the 1960s model of providing direct client services. Supported by resolutions from the Pasadena, San Gabriel, Eastern and Foothill bar associations, the two programs drew up plans to merge and submitted them to the Legal Services Corp. Dudovitz won Iwasaki's backing to oppose the deal, and Legal Services Corp., the national funding source, overruled the proposed San Gabriel-Pomona Valley/Orange County merger. On Jan. 27, 2001, the federal agency awarded the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley service area to Dudovitz under the umbrella of an expanded San Fernando program, citing the location of both programs in Los Angeles, which would allow \\"better coordinated and more effective advocacy on county government policies.\\" The San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program sued Legal Services Corp. to stop the takeover, claiming the federal program based the decision on favoritism for the politically active Dudovitz and the politically powerful Iwasaki.

Summarize this article: CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Health workers in protective hazmat suits treated patients in quarantine centers on Tuesday in a remote corner of Guinea where Ebola has killed at least 60 people in West Africa's first outbreak of the deadly virus in two decades. FILE -In this Saturday, Sept. 29, 2007, file photo, A 43 year old Congolese patient, center, who has been confirmed to have Ebola hemorrhagic fever, following laboratory tests, is comforted by Medecins... (Associated Press) Seven patients are being hospitalized at one isolation ward in Gueckedou in southern Guinea, while two others are being treated elsewhere, said Doctors Without Borders. The aid group said it is sending mobile teams into the surrounding countryside in search of people who may have been exposed since the first cases emerged last week. \\"To confine the epidemic, it is critical to trace the entire transmission chain,\\" said Dr. Esther Sterk, a tropical medicine adviser for the medical group. \\"All individuals who have had contact with patients who may be contaminated are monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection.\\" Six of the seven blood samples sent to France from Guinea had tested positive for Ebola, specifically the Zaire strain of the disease originating from Congo which has up to a 90 percent fatality rate, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. Ebola has no vaccine or specific treatment. Its initial symptoms — high fever, weakness and headache — can mimic malaria, a much more common disease in West Africa. Once the virus has caused hemorrhaging, though, victims can start vomiting blood or bleeding from their nose and gums. Some 1,500 of the 2,220 cases recorded since the virus was first discovered in 1976 have been fatal, experts say. So far the fatality rate in Guinea has been 70 percent, according to Dr. Sakoba Keita, a spokesman with the health ministry. Those grim statistics are fueling fear amid the first outbreak in this part of West Africa in 20 years. So far at least 60 people have died in Guinea, a desperately poor country with limited health facilities, Keita said. The outbreak has raised alarm in neighboring countries. Across the border in Liberia, officials are already investigating eight cases — including five deaths — suspected of having links to the Guinea cases. Those patients traveled across the border into Liberia in search of medical treatment, health officials said there. Authorities in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast say they are closely monitoring along their borders for possible cases. The last case reported in West Africa was in Ivory Coast back in 1994. More recent outbreaks have emerged in Congo and Uganda. It is unclear why the virus has now emerged in Guinea though Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with Doctors Without Borders, said the virus is carried by bats in the region. \\"It comes out of its reservoir when people eat bats or when bats share a tree with chimps or gorillas who are eating fruit,\\" he explained. \\"The chimps and gorillas become sick and become easy targets for bush meat hunters.\\" Grieving relatives also can contract the virus when they come into contact with the bodies of victims during communal funerals, health officials say. Other victims have included health workers who treated the patients before the Ebola outbreak was identified. ___ Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal. Associated Press writer Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia, Liberia also contributed to this report. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fruit bats are believed to be a major carrier of the Ebola virus but do not show symptoms Guinea has banned the sale and consumption of bats to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, its health minister has said. Bats, a local delicacy, appeared to be the \\"main agents\\" for the Ebola outbreak in the south, Rene Lamah said. Sixty-two people have now been killed by the virus in Guinea, with suspected cases reported in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by close contact. There is no known cure or vaccine. It kills between 25% and 90% of victims, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This is the first time such a national health threat has come to our borders Brima Kargbo, Sierra Leone health official Symptoms include internal and external bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting. 'Quarantine sites' It is the first time Ebola has struck Guinea, with recent outbreaks thousands of miles away, in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr Lamah announced the ban on the sale and consumption of bats during a tour of Forest Region, the epicentre of the epidemic, reports the BBC's Alhassan Sillah from the capital, Conakry. People who eat the animals often boil them into a sort of spicy pepper soup, our correspondent says. The soup is sold in village stores where people gather to drink alcohol. Other ways of preparing the bats to eat include drying them over a fire.

Health officials reported one more death on Tuesday, bringing the number of people killed by Ebola to 62, our correspondent adds. The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has set up two quarantine sites in southern Guinea to try to contain the outbreak, the Associated Press news agency reports. Health authorities are receiving help from the WHO while messages are being broadcast on national television to reassure people. Sierra Leone's health ministry said it was investigating two suspected cases of Ebola. \\"We still do not have any confirmed cases of Ebola in the country,\\" its chief medical officer Brima Kargbo told AFP. Ebola virus disease Causes severe outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) Fatality rate of up to 90% Occurs mostly in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests Transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads through human-to-human contact Fruit bats are thought to carry the Ebola virus No treatment or vaccine Source: WHO \\"What we do have are suspected cases, which our health teams are investigating and taking blood samples from people who had come in contact with those suspected to have the virus,\\" he added. Mr Kargbo said one suspected case involved a 14-year-old boy buried in a Sierra Leonean village after he apparently died across the border in Guinea two weeks ago, AFP reports. The other patient was still alive in the northern border district of Kambia, he added. Five people are reported to have died in Liberia after crossing from southern Guinea for treatment, Liberia's Health Minister Walter Gwenigale told journalists on Monday. However, it is not clear whether they had Ebola. Outbreaks of Ebola occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, the World Health Organization says. |||||","completion":"In Guinea, West Africa, there is an outbreak of a very dangerous virus called Ebola.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - expect to die - pay bills - buy pets - stay in - eat corn A:","completion":"Since we aren't immortal, people should expect to die. This option is the most suitable answer to the question because it directly addresses the human condition of mortality. Although the other options have their own merits and relevance in various contexts, they don't specifically respond to the question's focus on our lack of immortality. It is important for individuals to acknowledge and accept the inevitability of death, as it allows them to prioritize their values, make the most out of their time, and develop a healthy attitude towards the impermanence of life. Recognizing that one day we will die helps us better appreciate the time we have and make choices that align with our values and aspirations. Some ways to foster this awareness and acceptance of mortality include engaging in open conversations about death, considering end-of-life care preferences, and reflecting on the legacies we hope to leave behind. In addition, embracing the reality of death can inspire us to take care of ourselves mentally, emotionally, and physically, so that we can lead fulfilling lives and ensure that we have no regrets in the end. Although paying bills, buying pets, staying in, and eating corn can have meaningful and practical implications in different life situations, they don't inherently address the issue of our mortality. Paying bills is a necessary aspect of being financially responsible, while owning pets can provide companionship and positively impact mental health. Staying in reflects the need for relaxation and self-care, and eating corn may contribute to a well-balanced diet, but none of these options specifically tackle the acceptance of the fact that we are not immortal. In summary, given the options provided and the focus of the question on our lack of immortality, the most suitable response is that people should expect to die. This perspective promotes a healthy mindset, encouraging individuals to make the most of their time and prioritize their well-being and personal values. While the other choices may have merits in different contexts, none of them inherently address the issue of human mortality as directly as expecting to die."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Shaun Suisham got the Steelers within a touchdown by nailing a 26-yard field goal for a 17-10 lead. Walsh moved the Vikes ahead by 10 at halftime by kicking a 37-yard field goal for a 20-10 lead. The Steelers came within 3 as Le'Von Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown shortening the lead to 20-17 but the Vikes managed to move ahead 27-17 after Peterson ran for a 7-yard touchdown and then Cassel found Jennings again on a 16-yard touchdown pass to make the lead 34-17.

Let me answer them separately: Question 1: The reason behind Photoshop supporting only Zawgyi-One font for Myanmar but not Unicode might be due to compatibility and historical issues. When Zawgyi-One was created, it became a popular font in Myanmar before Unicode was widely adopted. As a result, many older applications, including Adobe Photoshop, might have added support for Zawgyi-One. However, newer versions of Adobe Photoshop should support Unicode Myanmar fonts. If you are still using an older version of Photoshop, consider updating to the latest version or finding alternative Myanmar Unicode fonts that may be compatible with your version. Question 2: To install fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Download the font you want to install onto your Mac. Font files typically come in .otf or .ttf formats. Step 2: Locate the downloaded font file, which may be in your \\"Downloads\\" folder or another location specified during download.

Step 4: Click the \\"Install Font\\" button at the bottom of the Font Preview window. This will install the font on your Mac. Step 5: Close any open Adobe Photoshop instances and restart the application. Upon reopening Photoshop CS5, the newly installed font should now be available in the font selection menu.

Jewish synagogues Congregation Sons of Israel and Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor & Ossining are in Chilmark.Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary's Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor's oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained-glass windows. The church, built in 1851, is a contributing property to the National Register-listed Scarborough Historic District. The 338-acre (137 ha) Sleepy Hollow Country Club surrounds the church grounds on three sides. Notable parishioners included Commodore Matthew C. Perry and Washington Irving. Irving, author of \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", brought the ivy surrounding the church from Abbotsford (home of Walter Scott).

However, everything changes on the day of his wedding anniversary, when he discovers his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman, Matt. After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car. He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed. Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice. After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue. Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions. After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated. Alan stabs Matt to death. Sarah and Paula are waiting for Alan at his practice. Alan sees Paula first, much to Sarah's disappointment.

Article: Snow falls in the Earth's extreme North and South throughout the year. However, the heaviest snowfalls have been reported in the mountains of other areas during winter. Snow is even known to fall near the Equator ,but only on the highest mountains. Snow contains much less water than rain, but much of the water the world uses comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power stations and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to seventy-five percent of all surface water supplies. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is limited. Snow also influences the movement of sound waves. The surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. As snow grows older or if there have been strong winds, it can become hard and flat. Then, the snow,s surface will help to send back sound waves. Snow may be beautiful, but it can be deadly. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads covered with snow and ice or from being seriously stuck in the winter storm. Others die from heart attacks caused by too much physical activity out in the cold. People may not be able to avoid living in areas where it snows often. However, they can avoid becoming victims of snowstorms. People should stop driving and stay at home until the storm has passed. People living in these areas should carry emergency supplies in their vehicle. These include food,emergency medical supplies,and extra clothing to stay warm and dry.

The high-end beans, such as Kona or Blue Mountain, are known to cost extraordinary sums of money. Then there is Kopi Lowak (translated as \\"Civet Coffee\\"), the world's most expensive coffee, which sells for as much as US 50 per quarter-pound. This isn't particularly surprising, because approximately 500 pounds a year of Kopi Lowak make up the entire world supply. What is surprising is why this particular coffee is so rare. In fact, it's not the plants that are rare. It's the civet droppings. That's right, the civet droppings--the body waste of the palm civet. Coffee beans aren't Kopi Lowak until they've been digested and come out in the body waste of the palm civet. Palm civets are tree-dwelling, raccoon-like little animals, native to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. They also have a love for coffee cherries. According to Kopi Lowak suppliers, palm civets eat the fruit whole, but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact . While the beans are not destroyed, they undergo a transformation in the animal's body. A chemical substance in the digestive system of the palm civet causes some changes to the beans to give them a unique flavor . However, this is not the only explanation why coffee beans retrieved from civet droppings have a special flavor all their own. Another possible reason is that palm civets have an unfailing instinct for picking the coffee cherries at the peak of their ripeness. Kopi Lowak is reported to have a character in taste unlike any other coffee, complex with caramel undertones and an earthy flavor. Currently, most of the world's supply of Kopi Lowak is sold in Japan, though a few US markets are also starting to stock up on Kopi Lowak. Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage? A) Little palm civets eat only the outer layer of the coffee cherries. B) Palm civets somehow know the right time when the coffee fruit ripens. C) Kopi Lowak is most popular in Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands.

The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945. Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales. Wayne Bronner said: \\"Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase.\\" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants.

Given the fact \\"living things all require energy for survival\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"What requires energy for survival?\\"","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What requires energy for survival?\\" is all living organisms or living things. Living organisms include a diverse range of species, from microorganisms and single-celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa, to multicellular organisms such as plants, animals, and fungi. Each of these living organisms has unique characteristics but shares a common requirement for energy to ensure their survival, growth, development, and reproduction. Energy is vital for all biological processes that occur within living organisms. Some essential functions for which energy is mandatory include: 1. Cellular metabolism: Cells, which are the basic units of life, undergo various metabolic reactions to synthesize or break down compounds needed for their survival. These reactions require an input of energy, derived generally from the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules. 2. Physical movement: Energy is needed for mechanical work such as muscle contraction, allowing movement and locomotion in animals and ensuring that they can hunt or escape from predators, reproduce, and interact with their environment. 3. Active transport: Cells require energy to transport vital substances such as nutrients, waste materials, and ions across their membranes. This exchange is crucial for maintaining cellular equilibrium and ensuring access to essential elements that support various cellular processes. 4. Growth and development: Organisms require energy for the synthesis of biomolecules, cell replication, and differentiation, ensuring growth, maturity, and the formation of specialized structures. 5. Reproduction: The formation and distribution of genetic material within new cells or offspring necessitate energy. It ensures that genetic information is passed on from one generation to the next, maintaining the continuity of life. 6. Homeostasis: Maintenance of internal bodily conditions at an optimal level, like consistent body temperature and pH balance in animals or osmotic balance in plants, requires energy. Homeostasis facilitates the proper functioning of cellular processes, preventing damage to an organism's internal environment. 7. Response to stimuli: Living organisms have the ability to perceive changes in their environment and react accordingly. This response to stimuli helps in adaptations and survival and necessitates energy for proper signal transmission and communication within cells. 8. Defense and repair: Organisms require energy to repair damaged cells or tissues, to initiate mechanisms that protect against pathogens or harmful environmental factors, and to maintain a robust immune system. In conclusion, living organisms, be it plants, animals, or microorganisms, all require energy for their survival, ensuring that their cells function effectively and maintaining the perpetuation of life. This energy is obtained primarily through the consumption of food, sunlight (in the case of photosynthetic organisms), or through chemosynthetic processes (for a certain group of bacteria)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. Which case would see clockwise movement, case A or case B? Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Case B.

Located at the junction of the Kabul River and Kunar River near the Laghman valley, Jalalabad is the capital of Nangarhar province. It is linked by approximately of highway with Kabul to the west. Jalalabad is the second-largest city in eastern Afghanistan as well as the centre of its social and business activity because of its border to Pakistan which is the main source of products to all of Afghanistan. Major industries include papermaking, as well as agricultural products including oranges, rice and sugarcane. Jalalabad is one of the leading trading centres with neighbouring Pakistan. The city of Jalalabad has a population of 356,274 (in 2015). it has 6 districts and a total land area of 12,796 Hectares. The total number of dwellings in this city are 39,586. - The Kabul River (; Sanskrit: ), the classical Cophes , is a long river that emerges in the Sanglakh Range of the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan and empties into the Indus River near Attock, Pakistan. It is the main river in eastern Afghanistan and is separated from the watershed of the Helmand by the Unai Pass. The Kabul River passes through the cities of Kabul and Jalalabad in Afghanistan before flowing into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan some north of the Durand Line border crossing at Torkham. The major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Kunar, Alingar, Bara and Swat rivers. - Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world. - The Kunar River (Urdu,), also called the Chitral River or the Kama River, is about 480 km long, located in northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and eastern Afghanistan. The river system is fed by melting glaciers and snow of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is also part of the Indus watershed basin. - Durrani or Abdali is the name of a prominent Sarbani Pashtun tribal confederation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Originally known by their ancient name \\"Abdali\\", which may derive from the more ancient \\"Ebodalo\\" (Bactrian: \\"\\" / \\"Hephthalites\\"). They have been called \\"Durrani\\" since the beginning of the Durrani Empire in 1747. The number of Durrani is estimated to be roughly 16% of the population of Afghanistan or 5 million individuals. Durrani are found throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan; although large concentrations are found in southern Afghanistan, they are also found to a lesser extent in east, west and central Afghanistan. Many Durranis are found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. The Durrani Pashtuns of the Afghan capital Kabul are usually bilingual in Pashto and Dari Persian. The ruling Sadozai and Barakzai dynasties of Afghanistan were originally from the Durrani. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - Atrial fibrillation (AF or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Most episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia. High blood pressure and valvular heart disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with one of these risks. A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate. AF is often treated with medications to slow the heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). Electrical cardioversion can also be used to convert AF to a normal sinus rhythm and is often used emergently if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people. Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding. Atrial fibrillation is the most common serious abnormal heart rhythm. In Europe and North America, as of 2014, it affects about 2% to 3% of the population. This is an increase from 0.4 to 1% of the population around 2005. In the developing world about 0.6% of... - Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes. - Faisal Ahmad Shinwari ( or Fazal Hadi Shinwari ) ( 1927 -- February 21 , 2011 ) was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan from 2001 until 2006 . He was appointed to the post by Afghan President Hamid Karzai in accordance with the Afghan Constitution approved after the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban government . An ethnic Pashtun from Jalalabad , Afghanistan , Shinwari died in February 2011 from stroke , he was a member of the Ittehad - al - Islami party . - Tajikistan (, or ), officially the Republic of Tajikistan (\\"Çumhuriji Toçikiston\\"), is a mountainous, landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013, and an area of . It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and China to the east. Pakistan lies to the south, separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor. Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from... - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled. - Hamid Karzai (Pashto/Persian: ; born 24 December 1957) served as President of Afghanistan for almost ten years, from 7 December 2004 to 29 September 2014. He comes from a politically active family; Karzai's father, uncle and grandfather were all active in Afghan politics and government. Karzai and his father before him, Abdul Ahad Karzai, were each head of the Popalzai tribe of the Durrani tribal confederation. - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also colloquially referred to as \\"the 'stans\\" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix \\"-stan\\", meaning \\"land of\\") and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent. - Pashto (; \\"Paxt\\" ), also known in older literature as Afghn or Pahn, is the South-Central Asian language of the Pashtuns. Its speakers are called Pashtuns or Pukhtuns and sometimes Afghans or Pathans. It is an Eastern Iranian language, belonging to the Indo-European family. Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, and it is the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the west and northwest of the country. Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are almost 100% Pashto-speaking, while it is the majority language of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern districts of Balochistan. Pashto is the main language among the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is estimated to be 4560 million people worldwide. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance.

Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group would be able to hear lower frequency, group A or group B? Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.

What is the answer: \\"The \\"\\"Coulomb\\"\\" is the SI Unit of what?\\"","completion":"The \\"Coulomb\\" is the SI (International System of Units) unit of electric charge. In the field of physics and electrical engineering, electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to one of the four fundamental forces of nature – the electromagnetic force. The Coulomb is named in honor of the French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who made significant contributions to the field of electromagnetism through his detailed research and experiments. A Coulomb, abbreviated as \\"C,\\" represents the quantity of electric charge that passes through a given point in an electric circuit within one second when the electric current in the circuit is one ampere. One Coulomb is numerically equivalent to 6.242 × 10^18 elementary charges, which is approximately the charge of 6.242 × 10^18 electrons or protons. The elementary charge, denoted by \\"e,\\" is the smallest possible electric charge that can exist in a free form and represents the charge of a single electron (which is -1e) or proton (which is +1e). Understanding the concept of electric charge and the Coulomb as its unit is crucial in describing the behavior and interactions of charged particles, as well as in the analysis and design of electrical circuits. In electrical circuits, the flow of electric charges causes what we commonly call \\"electric current.\\" The electric current is measured in amperes (A), and it indicates the number of Coulombs (units of electric charge) flowing through a particular point or section of the circuit per second. To put it in perspective, electric charges (measured in Coulombs) are the building blocks of electrical phenomena, while electric current (measured in amperes) is the rate at which these electric charges flow through a conductor or a circuit. In addition to being foundational to electromagnetism, electric charge and the electromagnetic force play a significant role in chemistry, biology, electronics, and communication technology. In summary, the \\"Coulomb\\" is the SI unit of electric charge, which is a fundamental property of matter associated with the electromagnetic force. A Coulomb represents the amount of electric charge that passes through a point in an electric circuit within one second when the electric current is one ampere. The concept of electric charge, along with the Coulomb as its unit, is vital in understanding various electrical phenomena, including the behavior of charged particles and the working of electrical circuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather changes happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The weather change can have an indirect effect on the waste removal process in the body. When the weather is hot or temperatures rise, the body tends to lose more water through sweating to maintain its temperature. As a result, a person may become dehydrated if they do not consume enough fluids. Dehydration can lead to a decrease in urine production, as the body conserves water. Consequently, less waste may be removed from the body through urine. On the other hand, if a person drinks more water during weather changes to stay hydrated, it may lead to an increase in urine production. This can eventually result in more waste being removed from the body as more waste products will be filtered out by the kidneys, combined with water to make urine, and excreted through the urinary system. In summary, the perturbation of weather changes can indirectly affect the waste removal process in the body, but this depends on an individual's water intake and overall hydration levels."},{"prompt":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming? Frank and Noah were two researchers. Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Peyton Manning is Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year. Mr Manning has led Denver to an 11-3 record this year, his second with the Broncos after missing the 2011 season with Indianapolis because of neck troubles that affected his right triceps. He has thrown 47 touchdown passes, three shy of Patriots quarterbackTom Brady's NFL season record set in 2007, and he has two games remaining. Man of the hour: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) passes Thursday night in the third quarter against the San Diego Chargers. Mr Manning last year won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year Award after returning from multiple neck surgeries that many feared would end his career. The Denver Broncos star spent 14 years. with the Indianapolis Colts before being released after sitting out the. 2011 season while rehabbing from the surgeries. Huge honor: Mr Manning is the fourth quarterback in the last nine years to win the honor. 'I have no idea who wants me, what team wants me, how this process works,' he said between tears at the press conference announcing the end of his time with the Colts. The veteran was already a first-ballot hall of famer at the time, but his 2013 season puts him on par with the all-time greats who have ever played the game. 'When great competitors get scorned, they come back with a vengeance,' former Broncos quarterback and current Executive Vice President of Football Operations John Elway told Sports Illustrated. 'We signed a Hall of Famer with a chip on his shoulder' That uncertainty must have motivated him, because he's having the greatest season by a quarterback in the 97 year history of the NFL - he's poised to break both the single-season touchdown and passing yards records. He has also guided his team to the top seed in the AFC playoffs - all at the age of 37. Mr Manning is the fourth NFL quarterback to take the honor in the last nine years, following Brady in 2005, Brett Favre in 2007 and Drew Brees in 2010. LeBron James was the winner last year.

Plot title: City Heat Movie plot: In Kansas City, 1933, near the end of Prohibition,[1] a police lieutenant known by his last name, Speer (Eastwood), is acquainted with a former cop turned private eye named Mike Murphy (Reynolds). Speer and Murphy were once good friends, which changed after Murphy left the force.[1] On a rainy night, Speer comes to a diner for coffee. Two goons arrive, looking for Murphy. They pounce the minute Murphy arrives, starting a fistfight. Speer, no fan of Murphy's, ignores the fight until a goon causes him to spill his coffee. Both goons are thrown through the front door. Murphy sarcastically thanks Speer for saving his life. The two rivals have eyes for Murphy's secretary Addy (Jane Alexander). She loves both and proves it when, after tenderly kissing Murphy goodbye, goes on a date with Speer. Murphy does have a new romantic interest, a rich socialite named Caroline Howley (Madeline Kahn), but finds himself unable to commit. Speer and Addy go to a boxing match at which the mob boss Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) is present. Murphy's partner Dehl Swift (Richard Roundtree) is also there, and seems to be in cahoots with Pitt and his gang. Swift is in possession of a briefcase whose contents, secret accounting records of rival gang boss Leon Coll's operations, are the target of both Pitt's and Coll's gangs. Swift, tailed by Speer and Addy, is confronted by Pitt's thugs at his apartment with Ginny Lee (Irene Cara) taken hostage. Ginny Lee manages to escape but Swift is shot and killed during a struggle with Pitt.[1] A thug opens the briefcase but there's nothing inside. He picks up Swift's body and throws it out the window, where it lands on the roof of Speer's parked car (which is occupied by the horrified Addy, who waits after Speer goes to investigate in the apartment). Murphy vows revenge on Pitt for killing his partner. He asks Speer for assistance and they form a reluctant alliance.

Write a title for this article: Buried in the earth below Colorado, Utah and Wyoming sit shale rock formations estimated to contain 800 billion barrels of oil, or half the world's proven reserves. To develop it, the U.S. government has granted mining concessions to three entities: Royal Dutch Shell (nyse: RDSA - news - people ), Chevron (nyse: CVX - news - people ) and Howard Jonas. Jonas, you may recall, was the entrepreneurial fellow behind IDT (nyse: IDT - news - people ), the widely advertised Newark, N.J. company that once dominated the overseas calling card market. As recently as 2004 IDT was worth 1.4 billion, though today its market capitalization has shrunk to 136 million, of which Jonas owns 47%. Jonas, 52, is trying to reinvigorate IDT's existing business lines, but he thinks the shale scheme could be his really big payoff. He figures it'll cost 40 to extract a barrel of oil from the shale and he'll be able to sell it for well over 100. Multiply that difference by his company's access to 5 billion barrels, and you've got 300 billion in profit. (\\"Which should help the stock,\\" he points out.) Alas, the technology to extract oil from shale for only 40 a barrel isn't there yet. But, he says, give him until 2015 and he'll figure it out. Jonas, an orthodox Jew with a truck driver's vocabulary, has been a visionary and an iconoclast ever since he started selling hot dogs outside a methadone clinic in his native Bronx 40 years ago--and wrote a book about it, On a Roll . He hit it big when he conceived the idea of arbitraging international phone rates, with a service that let callers from outside the United States connect to the U.S. over cheaper American lines. IDT became the third-largest Internet service provider for a time and pioneered Internet phone calling. The company sold that operation, Net2Phone, to AT&T in 1999 for 1.4 billion in cash. Jonas also built an entertainment company that IDT sold to John Malone's Liberty Media (nasdaq: LCAPA - news - people ) for 500 million and a fiber-optic ring around Moscow that brought in another 150 million. His company began running into problems around the time he took off to live in Israel for more than a year, starting in 2004. He claims that most of IDT's losses stem from its 2001 acquisition of Winstar, a wireless broadband outfit. He alleges that former management overstated revenues, and he is suing the Blackstone Group (nyse: BX - news - people ) over the advice it gave on the deal. Today IDT is a sprawling mess--everything from a phone company to ethnic foods, an electric utility and a debt collection agency--but it's a mess that now has Jonas' undivided attention. That isn't reassuring to everyone. William Martin, a former IDT short-seller and the founder of Internet stock message board Ragingbull.com, likes the stock at its 1.75 level but wishes Jonas were out of the picture. \\"If I were Howard Jonas and wanted to protect my net worth, I'd step down, waive my voting rights, bring in independent management and let them run this business properly,\\" says Martin, who manages a small hedge fund called Raging Capital. \\"Our shareholders are beyond pissed off,\\" Jonas admits, referring to the value and hedge funds that own most of IDT's float. \\"But I've let these guys know I'm taking this back over and here's what I'm going to do.\\" Since returning to IDT full-time, he has cut the staff from 8,000 to fewer than 2,000 and vacated half the company's headquarters. He has also finally persuaded state law enforcement officials to clamp down on calling card rivals who, he claims, undercut IDT by shortchanging customers on minutes. Jonas expects IDT to generate at least 30 million in annual operating income (Ebitda) starting in October. Another Jonas brainchild, Zedge, is a social networking portal akin to Facebook and MySpace but for cellular phone users. Zedge is already the largest such cell phone portal, with a registered base now 10 million strong and growing by 20,000 a day. As for shale, it may not be quite as kooky as it sounds. Jonas says that two of the world's seven largest oil firms (he won't name them) are in final negotiations to invest in Amso Resources, of which IDT owns 90%. With interest in alternative energy soaring, might it be time for this telecom guy from the Bronx to look for a hasty sale? \\"To give up on Zedge, or on shale, just before they're going to hit, you'd have to be clinically insane,\\" he says.

Write an article based on this summary: – Donald Trump is done with holding big fundraisers, meaning the Republican National Committee might find itself short of cash for its get-out-the-vote operation. The Washington Post reports that Trump's final high-dollar event for the Trump Victory Committee, which splits funds between the party and the candidate, was Oct. 19, the day of the final debate. \\"We are no longer doing formal, sit-down fundraising events,\\" Trump finance chief Steven Mnuchin tells the Wall Street Journal. He says the campaign—which remains far behind the Clinton campaign in fundraising—had always planned to spend the final weeks \\"winning the election\\" by holding rallies, not by using Trump to raise money. Hillary Clinton held her final big fundraiser in Miami Tuesday night, though surrogates including Chelsea Clinton and Tim Kaine are holding at least 40 events between now and the election, while Mnuchin says there is \\"virtually nothing planned\\" by the Trump campaign, the Post notes. Still, Mnuchin and RNC fundraisers say cash is continuing to flow in from various sources, including online fundraising. Trump has vowed to put 100 million of his own money into the campaign, though records show he has only put in 56 million so far, and Mnuchin didn't say whether the candidate plans to donate another 44 million before Election Day. \\"He has been very supportive of the campaign with his contributions,\\" he says.","completion":"Donald Trump's Decision to End Big Fundraisers: What It Means for the Republican National Committee In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump has decided to stop holding big fundraisers, potentially leaving the Republican National Committee (RNC) short of cash for its get-out-the-vote operation. According to the Washington Post, Trump's final high-dollar event for the Trump Victory Committee, which splits funds between the party and the candidate, took place on October 19, the day of the final debate. Trump finance chief Steven Mnuchin told the Wall Street Journal, \\"We are no longer doing formal, sit-down fundraising events.\\" With the campaign remaining far behind the Clinton campaign in fundraising, let's examine the reasons behind this decision and its potential impact on the RNC. The Trump campaign's decision to end big fundraisers can be attributed to its focus on spending the final weeks \\"winning the election\\" by holding rallies, rather than using Trump to raise money. This strategy aligns with Trump's image as an anti-establishment candidate and his dedication to connecting directly with the American people. While the Clinton campaign held its final big fundraiser in Miami on Tuesday night, various surrogates, including Chelsea Clinton and Tim Kaine, are holding at least 40 events between now and the election. In contrast, Mnuchin states that there is \\"virtually nothing planned\\" by the Trump campaign. Despite the sudden halt in big fundraisers, Mnuchin and RNC fundraisers maintain that cash is still flowing in from various sources, including online fundraising. Trump has also pledged to contribute 100 million of his own money to the campaign, although records show he has only put in 56 million thus far. Whether Trump plans to donate the remaining 44 million before Election Day remains uncertain, but Mnuchin assures that \\"he has been very supportive of the campaign with his contributions.\\" The potential consequences of this decision for the RNC are still unfolding. Without significant funds from big fundraisers, the RNC might find itself struggling to support its get-out-the-vote operation. Considering the importance of voter turnout in close elections, this shortfall could hinder the success of the Republican Party in both the presidential race and down-ballot contests. The decision to halt big fundraisers might also signal a shift in the Trump campaign's priorities, as it redirects its focus to rally-centered campaigning. In conclusion, Donald Trump's choice to stop holding big fundraisers is a bold move that emphasizes his dedication to connecting with voters through rallies, rather than traditional fundraising methods. However, this decision could potentially leave the Republican National Committee short of funds for its get-out-the-vote operation, impacting the success of the Republican Party in the upcoming election. While the long-term effects of this decision are yet to be seen, the Trump campaign is undoubtedly taking a different approach in the final weeks leading up to the election."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him.

Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000.

Here's a brief explanation for each of the other possible answers you mentioned: - Deep South: This term refers to the southeastern region of the United States. It consists of states that are known for their cultural, historic, and geographic distinctiveness. Louisiana is often considered a part of the Deep South, but the term does not encompass the entire United States. - Gulf States: This term typically refers to the states along the Gulf of Mexico, which include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. While Louisiana is one of the Gulf States, this term only refers to a specific region and does not encompass all 50 states. - Swamp: Louisiana is famous for its swamps and wetlands, particularly in the southern part of the state. However, this term does not describe the collection of 50 states that make up the United States. - 98% of the world's crayfish: Louisiana is a major producer of crayfish (also known as crawfish or crawdads), a popular culinary delicacy in the region. While the state does account for a significant percentage of the world's crayfish supply, this fact does not pertain to the collective United States as a whole. To sum up, Louisiana is indeed one of the 50 states that together comprise the United States of America. The other possible choices describe specific aspects or regions related to Louisiana, but they do not accurately capture the collective identity of the 50 states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: The Contractor for the following movie plot: Larry Coe is a Los Angeles architect who is married with two kids. He has a very bright wife, Eve. She is ambitious for him, but he wants to do work more imaginative than the commercial buildings he's been designing. He meets with Roger Altar, an author, to discuss building a house that will be an \\"experiment\\" and something Coe wants to do more of, something original. Maggie Gault is one of his neighbors whose son is friends with his. She tells Larry she has seen some of his previous houses and thinks that the more unconventional houses are the best. This encouragement is what he needs from his wife but hasn't been able to get. Both Larry and Maggie grow dissatisfied in their marriages. Larry's wife is too hard-headed and practical and Maggie's husband isn't interested in having sex with her. So they have an affair that involves meeting in secret. They both know what they're doing is wrong, and they are devoted to their children. Felix Anders is a neighbor who snoops around and finds out about their affair. His leering and insinuations make Larry realize the risks he's taking. He tells Maggie that they shouldn't see each other for a while. Felix, in the meantime, makes a play for Larry's wife. In a way, Felix is a personification of the tawdriness of Larry and Maggie's affair. After her near-rape by Felix, Eve wises up and realizes that Larry has been unfaithful. She confronts him. They agree to stay together and move to Hawaii, where Larry has been offered a job to design a city. Altar's house is finished but still empty. Maggie drives up to take a look at it. Larry shows up and they talk about how they can never be together. Larry wishes he and Maggie could live in the house and if they did, he would dig a moat around it and never leave it. Maggie says she loves him. The contractor for the house shows up and thinks Maggie is Larry's wife. They both take a moment to savor the irony of his remark and Maggie drives away.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \\"Best bedchamber\\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service...

B: did this to do a good job - This answer is somewhat reasonable but does not specifically address Bailey's motivation related to the promotion.

Article: With more and more wineries offering organic varieties to lower their eco-footprint , it's no surprise that they're looking at the environmental impacts of their packaging as well. The making of conventional glass bottles and the corks uses large quantities of natural resources and causes a lot of pollution. Beyond manufacturing, the transport of wine in glass bottles across the country and around the world also has its environmental effect. Trucking all the heavy glass bottles causes a much larger carbon footprint than the transportation of much lighter boxed wine. Almost half the weight of an ordinary case of wine comes from the bottles; about 95 percent of the weight of a case of boxed wine is the wine itself. \\"A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and causes about 5.2 pounds of carbon dioxide when it travels from a farm in California to a store in New York,\\" reports Colman, a researcher. \\"A 3-liter box causes about half the carbon dioxide per 750 milliliters.\\" According to the Wine Group, the third largest wine company in the world and a big advocate for switching away from glass bottles, there are other advantages to boxed wine (which typically includes a plastic bag within a cardboard box). The vacuum packaging of boxed wine allows it to stay fresh for up to six weeks in the fridge once the seal is broken and the first glass has been poured. Still, despite the benefits, boxed wine may still be a tough pill to swallow for many wine experts. \\"Even those traditionalists who are coming around to the idea that maybe screw caps are fine for some wines, would not like the idea of a cellar full of cardboard boxes,\\" says wine writer Lee Asbell. \\"It is difficult to imagine how wine service at fine-dining establishments would handle such a change.\\" For now, boxed wine is still the field of cheaper brands. But that could all change as more and more wine makers and drinkers take responsibility for saving the Earth. Question: Compared with glass bottled wine, boxed wine _ .

Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Before we begin solving, we need to identify the type of the equation. It has \\"i\\" terms on both sides, indicating that it is a linear algebraic equation which is to be solved for variable \\"i\\". The approach to solving such equations is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Let's start with simplifying the equation. Step 1: Subtract '217580*i' from both sides, so we can get all terms with 'i' on one side of the equation: 217691*i - 217580*i = 666 Step 2: This results in the following equation: 111 * i = 666 Step 3: Then you will solve for 'i' by dividing each side of the equation by 111: i = 666 / 111 So the solution for 'i' in the given equation is i = 6. Therefore, the value of 'i' that satisfies the original given equation 217580*i = 217691*i + 666 is i = 6. Always remember to check your solution by substituting the found value back into the original equation to verify it holds true."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What two events were the American pressman alerted to that were going to coincide together? from the following article ? American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public. Halberstam's report estimated that the altercation lasted for around ten minutes and also admitted that the pressmen had tried to apprehend the policeman who had smashed Browne's camera but were shielded by the rock-wielding policeman's colleagues.

Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Associated Press. Eric Garner (pictured) died on July 17 after being put in a choke-hold by an NYPD officer. A New York prosecutor will ask a grand jury to consider charges in the death of a black man placed in an apparent choke-hold by a white police officer, he said today. Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan announced that an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence next month in the July 17 death of Eric Garner. 'I assure the public that I am committed to conducting a fair, thorough and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner's death, and that I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor,' Donovan said in a statement. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, could be heard on an amateur video shouting 'I can't breathe!' as Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in an apparent chokehold. Police said the officers were arresting Garner on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A second video, which appeared to have been shot shortly after Garner was handcuffed, showed him lying on the sidewalk, apparently unresponsive. More than three minutes in, medics arrive and one checks his pulse. Garner is lifted onto a gurney and transported to a waiting ambulance about two minutes later. A bystander asks why no one is performing CPR and one officer responds, 'because he's breathing.' Garner, who had asthma, died a short time later. Donovan said his decision to take the case to a grand jury was based on his office's investigation and the medical examiner's ruling that the death was a homicide caused by neck compressions from the chokehold, chest compression and Garner's prone position while being restrained. Donovan said a court granted his request for the extra grand jury on Monday. He said in a statement that he would make no additional comment about the panel's work, including possible witnesses and charges, to maintain proceedings' secrecy. Eric Garner's body lies in a casket during his funeral at Bethel Baptist Church in the Brooklyn borough of New York on July 23. Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, was stripped of his gun and badge after Garner's death and another officer was placed on desk duty. Two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians were suspended without pay. Pantaleo's lawyer, Stuart London, said it was too early to say whether his client would testify before the grand jury. 'That's a decision that I weigh very carefully,' London said. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the union expected a grand jury investigation and is encouraged that the process is moving forward. 'We are confident that a fair and impartial grand jury that is allowed to conduct its deliberations based on facts and not emotion or political considerations will see that justice is served,' Lynch said in a statement. Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton plans to lead a march to Donovan's office on Saturday. Protesters are calling for Donovan to file criminal charges or let federal prosecutors take over. Several members of New York's congressional delegation last week echoed the call for the Justice Department to investigate. They questioned whether Donovan, a Republican, could adequately investigate the case given his close working relationship with police and the borough's large population of police officers. Sharpton said he, Garner's family and the family's lawyers will meet Thursday with U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to reiterate their desire for a federal investigation. 'This announcement does not impact our move for federal takeover of this case at all,' Sharpton said in a statement. Highlights:","completion":"- Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan announces an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence in the death of Eric Garner, who was put in an apparent choke-hold by an NYPD officer. - The decision to take the case to a grand jury is based on the medical examiner's ruling that the death was a homicide caused by neck compressions from the chokehold, chest compression, and Garner's prone position while being restrained. - Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who placed Garner in the chokehold, was stripped of his gun and badge after Garner's death; another officer was placed on desk duty. - Rev. Al Sharpton plans to lead a march to Donovan's office, calling for Donovan to file criminal charges or let federal prosecutors take over the case. - Garner's family and civil rights advocates continue to push for a federal investigation into his death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We are given the equation 1133 = b + 1137, and our goal is to find the value of b. Step 2: Isolate the variable (b). To find the value of b, we need to isolate it from the rest of the equation. In this case, we need to move the constant term (1137) from the right side of the equal sign to the left side. We do this by subtracting 1137 from both sides of the equation.

What is the likely occupation of the OP ?","completion":"In order to determine the likely occupation of the original poster (OP), I need to analyze the contents of the article. 1. The OP mentions working a night shift, which implies they work during nighttime hours. This is common in various occupations such as security guards, nurses, factory workers, and retail employees. 2. The OP talks about the day crew pushing off work onto them, suggesting that there is a division of responsibilities between day and night shifts. 3. The OP brings up a milk shipment and the importance of having a full milk rack in the chiller for customer relations. This implies that the OP is in some way responsible for stocking perishable goods, which is common in retail, specifically grocery stores or convenience stores. 4. Lastly, the OP mentions that customers might leave the store if they can't find milk, affecting the sales of other items. This again points to the fact that the OP's occupation is likely related to the retail industry.

Options: 1). no. 2). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answers to these two questions differ as they address different aspects of hair growth relating to skin hair and facial hair. Question 1: Can I grow my skin hair into a facial hair? The simple answer to this question is no. Skin hair and facial hair are different types of hair, and they have unique growth patterns regulated by genetic factors and hormones. Skin hair, also known as vellus hair, is thin, short, and lightly pigmented, covering most of the body. In contrast, facial hair, also known as terminal hair, is thicker, longer, and darker, usually found on the face and in other areas such as the chest, armpits, and pubic areas. Androgen hormones, specifically dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a crucial role in stimulating the growth of facial hair. The hair follicles of the face have receptors that are sensitive to androgens, leading to the development of thick and coarse facial hair. On the contrary, other areas of the body have hair follicles that are less sensitive or resistant to androgens, resulting in the presence of thin and fine skin hair. So, it is not possible to transform skin hair into facial hair. Question 2: What can men do to stimulate their skin to grow less facial hair? There are a few methods men can consider to reduce the growth of facial hair or make it appear less prominent. Here are some options: 1. Hormonal therapy: In some cases, excessive facial hair growth might be due to hormonal imbalances. If this is the cause, consulting a medical professional for appropriate hormonal therapy could help to manage the growth of facial hair. 2. Hair removal techniques: Men can consider using hair removal techniques such as shaving, trimming, waxing, or using hair removal creams explicitly designed for facial hair. These methods provide temporary relief from facial hair growth by removing the hair from the surface of the skin. It's important to note that hair will eventually grow back. 3. Laser hair removal: This is a more permanent solution to reducing facial hair growth. Laser hair removal uses light to target and destroy hair follicles responsible for hair growth without causing damage to the surrounding skin. This treatment is a long-term solution as it reduces the number of hair follicles producing hair, leading to slow or minimal hair growth in the targeted areas. 4. Electrolysis: This is another permanent method for hair reduction. Electrolysis uses an electric current to destroy the hair follicle, preventing hair from growing back. This process is time-consuming and can be costly, but many people find it effective in preventing hair growth in targeted areas. 5. Natural remedies: Some people believe that certain natural remedies, such as applying a mixture of turmeric and milk to the unwanted hair or using herbal hair inhibitors (like spearmint tea), can help to minimize facial hair growth. However, the effectiveness of these remedies is not scientifically proven and may not work for everyone. In conclusion, the answers to your questions are different. Skin hair cannot grow into facial hair due to the distinct properties and growth patterns of these two types of hair. To stimulate the skin to grow less facial hair, men can consider options like hormonal therapy, hair removal techniques, laser hair removal, electrolysis, or natural remedies, but the effectiveness of each varies between individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Chartered Institute of Archaeology says there is already a shortage of archaeologists, needed to work alongside major building projects.

Teachers who are campaigning against the loss of the subject, taken by about 1,500 students, say the decision came \\"out of the blue\\". Daniel Boatright, who teaches the subject at Worcester Sixth Form College, says that pupils benefit from such specialist subjects, which might find skills that would otherwise \\"have been left undiscovered\\". Dr Boatright says it is \\"extremely naive\\" to narrow student choices to a curriculum of \\"major subjects\\" - and he has launched an online petition which has gathered more than 5,000 signatures. At the top of the petition is a quote from Roman philosopher Cicero: \\"To be ignorant of what went before you were born is to remain always a child.\\" A student taking the A-level at the school, Jamie Williams, said he was now applying to take the subject at university, but only realised he wanted to take a degree in archaeology because he had been able to study it at A-level.

He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam).

Question: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Which person studied more about the stable state? Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Identify the subjects each person studied. - Paul studied the Gaia hypothesis. - Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Step 2: Determine which subject involves the study of a stable state. - The Gaia hypothesis involves the study of the Earth as a self-regulating system, seeking to maintain a stable state (homeostasis) through interactions between living organisms and their environment. - Einstein's Theory of Relativity is about the relationship between space and time and the effects of gravity on them; it does not directly relate to studying a stable state. Step 3: Match the person to the subject. - Paul studied the Gaia hypothesis, which is related to the study of a stable state. - Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which is not directly related to the study of a stable state. Answer: Paul studied more about the stable state, as his subject, the Gaia hypothesis, is centered around the concept of homeostasis and maintaining a stable state within the Earth's biosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: James Lawrence Levine (; born June 23, 1943) is an American conductor and pianist. He is primarily known for his tenure as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\"), a position he held for 40 years (1976-2016). He was formally terminated by the Met from all his positions and affiliations with the company on March 12, 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations which he denies. Context: Levine made his Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\") debut at age 28 on June 5, 1971, leading a June Festival performance of Tosca. Following further appearances with the company, he was named principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in February 1972. He became the Met's principal conductor in 1973, and its Music Director in 1975. In 1983, he served as conductor and musical director for the Franco Zeffirelli screen adaptation of La Traviata, which featured the Met orchestra and chorus members. He became the company's first artistic director in 1986, and relinquished the title in 2004. In 2005, Levine's combined salary from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Met made him the highest-paid conductor in the country, at 3.5 million. During Levine's tenure, the Metropolitan Opera orchestra expanded its activities into the realms of recording, and separate concert series for the orchestra and chamber ensembles from The Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Levine led the Metropolitan Opera on many domestic and international tours. For the 25th anniversary of his Met debut, Levine conducted the world premiere of John Harbison's The Great Gatsby, commissioned especially to mark the occasion. On his appointment as general manager of the Met, Peter Gelb emphasized that Levine was welcome to remain as long as he wanted to direct music there. Levine was paid 2.1 million by the Met in 2010. Following a series of injuries that began with a fall (see below), Levine's subsequent health problems led to his withdrawal from many Metropolitan Opera conducting engagements. Following a May 2011 performance of Die Walkure, Levine formally withdrew from all conducting engagements at the Met. After two years of physical therapy, Levine returned to conducting with a May 2013 concert with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. On September 25, 2013, Levine conducted his first Met performance since May 2011, in a revival production of Cosi fan tutte. Levine was scheduled to conduct three productions at the opera house and three concerts at Carnegie Hall in the 2013-14 season. On April 14, 2016, Met management announced that Levine would step down from his position as Music Director at the end of the 2015-16 season. Levine was paid 1.8 million by the Met for the 2015/16 season. He assumed the new title of Music Director Emeritus, which he held until December 2017, when in the wake of allegations that Levine had sexually abused four young men, the Met suspended its relationship with him and cancelled all his future scheduled performances with the company. Question: What did he perform? Answer:","completion":"James Levine performed as a conductor and pianist throughout his career. In his Metropolitan Opera debut, he led a performance of Tosca on June 5, 1971. He conducted various operas, concerts, and musical events during his tenure at the Met, such as the world premiere of John Harbison's The Great Gatsby, commemorating the 25th anniversary of his debut. Additionally, he served as conductor and musical director for the Franco Zeffirelli screen adaptation of La Traviata in 1983.

It seems the tech giant has no plans to slow down anytime soon, as new reports indicate that the company's key supplier, Foxconn, is producing an astonishing 500,000 iPhone 5S units per day in order to keep up with growing demand. A Milestone in Smartphone Production The feat of manufacturing half a million units of a single smartphone model each day is an extraordinary accomplishment in the electronics industry. It showcases the unparalleled efficiency of the production process as well as the abilities of Foxconn, which has been highly instrumental in Apple's unprecedented success in the smartphone market. This decision to ramp up production comes as no surprise, given that Apple seeks to fulfill the high demand for the iPhone 5S and stay ahead of the curve in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. The iPhone 5S, which was released on September 20, 2013, and garners rave reviews from tech enthusiasts and regular users alike, has been pivotal in catapulting Apple to its lofty position. What This Means for the Smartphone Market The fact that 500,000 iPhone 5S devices are being produced daily can have far-reaching implications for the smartphone market in general. For one, other smartphone manufacturers are bound to feel the pressure in terms of producing their own high-quality devices in large numbers to stay relevant in the competitive landscape. Additionally, this can result in more innovation and rapid evolution on the part of manufacturers to ensure their devices meet and exceed consumer expectations. It is safe to say that the success of the iPhone 5S puts Apple in a dominant position, and this monumental production figure serves as a wake-up call to other smartphone manufacturers to step up their game in order to stand a chance in this cutthroat market. Implications for Apple and Future Devices The high production numbers for the iPhone 5S not only help Apple meet demand but also indicate the company's strong belief in the sales potential of its flagship device. In many respects, the more devices Apple produces, the better its economies of scale, allowing it to create cost savings and potentially improve profit margins. With this level of production, Apple may well be preparing for other new devices and product launches in the near future. For instance, the tech giant has long been rumored to be working on a new, larger iPhone model, which could further propel its dominance in the smartphone market. Conclusion The news that Foxconn is producing a record 500,000 iPhone 5S units per day only serves to solidify Apple's position as a formidable player in the smartphone market. It's clear that Apple highly values its partnership with Foxconn, as the production efficiency gained through this alliance strongly supports its continued growth and success. As more users around the world demand high-quality smartphones and become increasingly reliant on devices like the iPhone 5S, it's likely that production numbers will continue to remain astronomically high. In that sense, this reported milestone can be seen as a harbinger of things to come in the ever-evolving smartphone market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: SYDNEY (AFP) Nick Bryant reports: \\"It gives me great pleasure to introduce the new caretaker of the islands of the Great Barrier Reef, from the United Kingdom, Ben Southall.\\" A global recruitment drive with the trappings of a TV reality show made it truly a tourism marketing campaign. The best job in the world's competition finally has a winner, Ben Southall, a 34-year-old charity worker from Britain. He beat 34,000 candidates from 200 countries in an online competition that became something of an Internet phenomenon. \\"To go away now as the island caretaker for Tourism Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef is an extreme honour. I hope I can fill the boots as much as everybody is expecting, my swimming hopefully is up to standard and I look forward to all of the new roles and responsibilities that the task involves.\\" [Ben Southall] For a disappointing Australian tourism industry currently in the _ , this has been an unexpected encouragement. Tourism Queensland deliberately chose the middle of winter of the northern globe to launch the campaign back in January, but didn't expect anywhere near the global response. They think the only countries where people didn't visit their website was North Korea and a few African nations. What's said to be the best job in the world comes with a 110,000 (about 750,000 yuan) contract for six months' work, a luxury beachside home and a plunge pool. In return, the island caretaker will be expected to stroll the white sands, enjoy the sun, diving and taking care of the reef, \\"maybe clean the pool\\"-- and report to a global audience via weekly blogs , photo diaries and video updates.

Also people remember you because of your humour. But I think I don't have a very good sense of humour. Could you suggest how to build on this? ----Radha Karnik This is a great question that is unfortunately difficult to answer. I can only give you my views on this topic, which may or may not be correct. I know that my sense of humour developed over time. When I was younger I was not funny at all, now I can easily make people laugh. At the same time, sometimes I say things that I think are very funny but others do not. Improving wit and humour, I believe, is an ongoing process. Now, there are various forms of humour and everyone has their individual style. Overall, I believe being fluent in a language is very important for being witty or funny. The way we play around with words adds the \\"funny\\" tag to an otherwise normal sentence. Also, seeing irony is very important. I think humour is often the link between two unrelated things. In my experience, laughing frequently and appreciating other people's jokes and wit are very important. Within these, finding humour in everyday normal situations is the key. I often notice what is going on around me and say funny things in my head and laugh to myself. That serves almost as practice for when I am in a group. I watch comedy shows and movies and I am sure that has some effect on helping me improve my sense of humour. And last, having confidence that you are witty is important. There will always be someone wittier or funnier than you, which is fine. Just work on building your own style. Remember, if you are trying to be funny and witty in order to break the ice at a business function, be careful. In those situations, humour has to be mild and politically correct. Yours, Brad Question: Radha Karnik's problem is that he doesn't _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"have a good sense of humour\\"?

It was hard to hang around with people when you were the only one without wheels. He thought about what he could do. It was no use asking his parents, for he knew they had no money to save. There was only one way to get money, and that was to earn it. He would have to find a job. But who would hire him and what could he do?

Review: My husband and I became the reluctant parents of a bulldog lab mix. Devoted as she was to us she was unruly, hyperactive, and randomly aggressive toward other dogs.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard).

Brett always had fresh flowers in the house unlike Eric because","completion":"Brett always had fresh flowers in the house unlike Eric because he understood the numerous benefits that they brought, both for himself and for his home environment. As someone who had grown up with a strong appreciation for natural beauty, Brett believed that incorporating fresh flowers into his daily life was an essential aspect of creating a comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and welcoming atmosphere within his living space. One of the primary reasons Brett chose to consistently have fresh flowers in his home was the psychological benefits they provided. Numerous studies have shown that the presence of flowers can significantly improve one's mood, reduce stress, and promote an overall sense of well-being. This is largely due to the vibrant colors and pleasing scents that flowers possess, which can both calm and stimulate the human brain. By having fresh flowers in his home, Brett was creating a space that encouraged relaxation, happiness, and mental clarity. Another advantage of having fresh flowers in the house that Brett appreciated was their ability to purify the air. Many plants, including flowers, are known to absorb harmful pollutants and toxins from the air, effectively acting as natural air purifiers. This not only makes the air safer to breathe but can also help to reduce the risk of developing respiratory issues. Furthermore, the increased oxygen levels in a room with fresh flowers can help to maintain a healthy humidity level, thus contributing to better overall air quality. Aesthetically speaking, Brett also recognized the tremendous value that fresh flowers brought to the overall appearance of his home. By choosing various colors, styles, and arrangements, he was able to use the flowers to create different focal points, complement existing design motifs, and even lend a seasonal touch to his living space. This constant rotation of fresh flowers allowed Brett to keep his home feeling fresh, dynamic, and engaging, enabling him to put his creative stamp on his environment in a subtle yet impactful way. Lastly, Brett believed that having fresh flowers in the house helped to promote a sense of hospitality and warmth. For guests and visitors, the presence of flowers signals that a host has put thought and effort into creating a comfortable, inviting atmosphere. Moreover, the sweet, natural fragrances that flowers exude often serve as a means to stimulate positive memories and associations, helping to create a strong sense of nostalgia and shared experience. In contrast, Eric did not prioritize having fresh flowers in his home, and as a result, he missed out on the numerous benefits that they provided. Whether Eric was simply unaware of the value that fresh flowers held or had other priorities when it came to his living environment, Brett's dedication to keeping fresh flowers in his home ultimately resulted in a more enjoyable, inviting, and healthy space for all who entered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Night of the Living Dead Movie plot: Siblings Barbara and Johnnie visit their mother's grave in a remote Pennsylvania cemetery. During their visit, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, and the remaining members remain upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts even more zombies to the farmhouse, soon collecting a large mob. The group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a couple hundred yards away. A search of the corpse who lived in the farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to the gas pump is not among the bunch they brought with them. When Tom shoots the lock off, the leaking gasoline is...

A:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the movie's content, stating that it was tame compared to the expected level of action and violence often associated with Japanimation. They also mention not being impressed with the movie, despite it having won lots of awards.

In simple words, the main idea is that one man is showing off a fun position with a bike and another man is looking at him. The hypothesis says the same thing - one man is doing something interesting on a bike and the other man is watching what he is doing.

What is the title of this article: In 1903 Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid, formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid, phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers. Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy.","completion":"The title of this article could be: \\"The History and Development of Barbiturates and Amphetamines: From Discovery to Modern Medical Uses\\""},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ottoman Empire The effective military and bureaucratic structures of the previous century came under strain during a protracted period of misrule by weak Sultans. The Ottomans gradually fell behind the Europeans in military technology as the innovation that fed the Empire's forceful expansion became stifled by growing religious and intellectual conservatism.
