The answer to the question: Which wing in the building that's largest first floor room is called the Withdrawing Room came to be the service wing? is inside the article: The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \\"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports.

Hoping to end their horrendous five-game skid, the Cardinals traveled to McAfee Coliseum to face the Oakland Raiders. The Raiders came into the game at 0-5, the only winless team in the NFL. This would be the Cardinals' first game under new offensive coordinator Mike Kruczek, who replaced the fired Keith Rowen in the wake of Arizona's meltdown in the fourth quarter of the game against Chicago. Arizona has visited Oakland only once before. The Cardinals won 34-31 on an overtime field goal by Bill Gramatica on December 2, 2001. The Raiders won the last meeting with the Cardinals, 41-20 at Sun Devil Stadium on November 24, 2002. In the first quarter, the Cards string of bad luck continued to haunt them, as Raiders RB ReShard Lee got a 1-yard TD run, while QB Andrew Walter threw a 32-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. In the second quarter, both teams swapped field goals. Oakland kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 31-yard field goal, while Arizona kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 29-yard try. In the third quarter, the Raiders continued to pour on the points, as Janikowski got a 35-yard field goal, while Defensive Tackle Terdell Sands tackles Cardinals RB Marcel Shipp at the goal line for a safety. The only response Arizona could bring up was Rackers kicking a 45-yard field goal. He would kick one more in the fourth quarter (38-yarder), but that would be all that the Cardinals could produce as they now dropped six-straight games.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Just as in English, the numbers 11 and 12 in German are outliers – they aren't formed the way the other larger numbers are. For this reason, it's easiest to learn them separately. Eleven is \\"elf\\" (elf). Twelve is \\"zwölf\\" (tsvoolf). This is a deceptively difficult word for native English speakers to pronounce. The \\"teens\\" in German are formed similarly to the way these number-words are formed in English, although English actually gets a bit more complicated. In German, all you have to do is take the word for ten, \\"zehn,\\" which you already know. On the front of \\"zehn,\\" put the word from one to nine that corresponds to the second digit of the number. So, for example, 13 in German is \\"dreizehn\\" (DRIGH-tsayn). Literally, you can think of it as \\"three and ten,\\" which add up to 13. All the other number-words in the teens are formed the same way, with stress always on the first syllable. The easiest way to learn to continue counting in German is to first memorize the words for the tens – 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. Many of these words are formed by adding \\"zig\\" to the word for the initial number, as you'll see: Twenty is \\"zwanzig\\" (TSVAHN-tsikh). Thirty is \\"dreißig\\" (DRIGH-sikh). The \\"ß,\\" called an Eszett or scharfes S (sharp S), is a unique German letter pronounced essentially like the \\"s\\" sound in \\"kiss\\" or \\"bless.\\" Forty is \\"vierzig\\" (FEER-tsikh). Fifty is \\"fünfzig\\" (FUUNF-tsikh). Sixty is \\"sechzig\\" (ZEKH-tsikh). Seventy is \\"siebzig\\" (ZEEP-tsikh). Eighty is \\"achtzig\\" (AHKH-tsikh). Ninety is \\"neunzig\\" (NOYN-tsikh). Once you know how to count by tens and how to count from one to nine, you have all the building blocks you need to create virtually any other number in German. Start with the smallest number, and work up from there to build the word. For example, 21 in German is \\"einundzwanzig\\" (IGN-oont-tsvahn-tsikh). A literal translation would be \\"one and twenty,\\" as \\"und\\" is the German word for \\"and.\\" All numbers up to a hundred are built this way, with the word for 100 being \\"hundert\\" (HOON-dert). The word literally means \\"hundred,\\" so 100 is einhundert. As you can probably guess, the building starts again here, the same as it did with the lower numbers. Write (or say) the hundreds first, then the digits that follow. Keep in mind that there's no \\"und\\" or \\"and\\" between the hundred and the other digits. Since people often say \\"three hundred and eleven\\" in English to mean 311, you might be tempted to add it in. Since you know how to pronounce the building blocks, you know how to build and pronounce some lengthy words. For example, 535 in German is \\"fünfhundertfünfunddreißig.\\"","completion":"The article teaches how to count and pronounce numbers in German, starting from 11 to 100 and beyond, by learning number words, their structure, and how to combine them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which friend had a decreased blood flow to the heart? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Fred is the friend who had a decreased blood flow to the heart. Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30s, which can contribute to high cholesterol levels. High cholesterol is known to play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, where cholesterol and other materials become deposited in the arterial walls. This leads to the formation of plaques that can restrict or block the blood flow in blood vessels. As a result, Fred's high cholesterol levels increase his risk for atherosclerosis, which can cause a decrease in blood flow to the heart. This can ultimately lead to high blood pressure, a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle, and even heart attacks due to complete blockage of blood flow.

The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -203*k + 223*k + 40 for k, follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the coefficients of k. The equation has two terms with variable k: -203 * k and 223 * k. Combine these terms by adding their coefficients (the numbers in front of k). -203 * k + 223 * k = (223 - 203) * k (223 - 203) = 20, so the new equation is: 0 = 20 * k + 40 Step 2: Isolate the k term. To find the value of k, we need to isolate the k term on one side of the equation. In this case, we want to get k by itself on the left side and a constant term on the other side. First, we'll subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 40 = 20 * k - 40 This simplifies to: -40 = 20 * k Step 3: Solve for k. Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k, which is 20: -40 / 20 = 20 * k / 20 This simplifies to: -2 = k The solution to the equation is k = -2."},{"prompt":"Q:Build a movie plot around this: Who is Harrison accuesed of murdering?

Things take a shocking turn when the forensic team finds Harrison's fingerprints on the murder weapon and remnants of trace evidence leading back to his home. Harrison is arrested and accused of murdering Grace, causing a sensational media frenzy. Faced with mounting evidence against him, Harrison is forced to go on the run, conducting his own unauthorized investigation to prove his innocence. He befriends a young reporter, Sara, who sees potential in Harrison's story and is eager to break the story of her career.

What is the answer: What does the Salk vaccine protect against","completion":"The Salk vaccine, also known as the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), is a valuable immunization tool designed to protect individuals against poliomyelitis, commonly referred to as polio. Polio is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to severe complications such as paralysis, respiratory failure, and even death. The virus primarily targets the nerve cells in the spinal cord associated with muscle control, which can result in the temporary or permanent paralysis of various body parts. Dr. Jonas Salk developed the vaccine in the early 1950s, and it was introduced to the public on April 12, 1955. The Salk vaccine is based on inactivated poliovirus, meaning the virus has been rendered non-infectious through a process of chemical treatment, such as through the use of formalin. This inactivated form of the virus is unable to cause the disease but still maintains the capacity to generate an immune response when administered as a vaccine. Receiving the Salk vaccine trains the immune system to recognize and neutralize the live virus if the individual ever encounters it in the future. The inactivated poliovirus vaccine is administered through a series of injections given to individuals at specific ages. The recommended IPV schedule includes four doses, typically administered at two months, four months, six to eighteen months, and a final booster dose between the ages of four and six years. This schedule has proven to be highly effective in immunizing recipients against all three types of poliovirus. The widespread use of the Salk vaccine, in conjunction with the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) developed by Dr. Albert Sabin, has significantly contributed to the near-global eradication of polio. Once a ubiquitous threat, the number of polio cases globally has reduced by over 99% since the implementation of vaccination efforts. According to the World Health Organization, only Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to have ongoing transmission of wild poliovirus. The highly successful polio vaccination campaigns across the world underscore the importance of the Salk vaccine in the fight against this debilitating disease. In summary, the Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine, provides vital protection against poliomyelitis, a disease that can cause severe paralysis or death. Through the widespread use of this vaccine and the oral poliovirus vaccine, global health organizations have made significant strides in controlling and nearly eradicating polio. Continued vaccination efforts are essential to maintaining this progress and achieving a polio-free world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When considering the context of the question and the provided potential answers, we can deduce that the person is seeking a solution for purchasing or acquiring a mailbox, rather than a location for installing the mailbox. Since we are looking for a place where mailboxes are sold or distributed, we can evaluate each of the possible answers using human common sense. 1. Downtown area: While it is true that a downtown area may have retail stores selling various items, including mailboxes, it is a vague answer that does not provide specific information about where to find a mailbox in such a vast area. Also, not all downtown areas have stores that sell mailboxes. 2. Front yard: A front yard refers to a plot of land, usually located in front of a house or a property. It is a place where a mailbox could potentially be installed to receive mail, but it does not provide any information about acquiring a mailbox if one does not already have it. 3. Obesity: Obesity is an unrelated term, which refers to the medical condition of having an excess amount of body fat. It has no connection with purchasing or obtaining a mailbox. 4. Post office: A post office is a facility operated by a country's postal system to handle mail services, including sending, receiving, sorting, and distributing mail or packages. While some post offices may sell postal-related items, not all post offices sell or distribute mailboxes. Furthermore, in many countries, post offices are more focused on providing mailing services rather than selling physical items like mailboxes. 5. Hardware store: A hardware store is a store that sells various tools, equipment, and home improvement supplies, including mailboxes. People typically go to hardware stores to purchase items needed for DIY projects, home repairs, and installations, making it a logical place to find mailboxes for sale. In addition, most hardware stores carry an assortment of mailbox styles, sizes, and materials, making it possible for customers to choose a suitable mailbox for their specific needs.

It is essential to analyze the information provided in the review and what aspects could impact the buyer's decision. First, the reviewer expressed an admiration for the story line, which could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the product. However, this praise is not enough to outweigh the negative experiences they had with the transaction process. Second, the primary reason for the negative review is that the product was not received even after the reviewer contacted the seller. This issue would invoke concerns about the seller's reliability and trustworthiness. As a potential customer, it is crucial to feel confident that the purchase will be completed successfully and that the product will arrive as expected. Third, the reviewer's emotional state, as expressed by phrases such as \\"totally pissed,\\" suggests that this situation caused significant frustration and disappointment. It is an understatement of the dissatisfaction that the reviewer experienced, which could affect any potential buyer's decision-making process.

In July 1449 Esen Tayisi of the Mongols launched a large-scale, three-pronged invasion of China with his puppet khagan Toqtaq-Buqa. He personally advanced on Datong in August. The eunuch official Wang Zhen, who dominated the Ming court, encouraged the 22-year-old Zhengtong Emperor to lead his own armies into battle against Esen. The size of Esen's army is unknown but a best guess puts it at some 20,000 men. The Ming army of about 500,000 was hastily assembled; its command was made up of 20 experienced generals and a large entourage of high-ranking civil officials, with Wang Zhen acting as field marshal. On August 3 Esen's army crushed a badly supplied Chinese army at Yanghe, just inside the Great Wall. The same day the Emperor appointed his half-brother Zhu Qiyu as regent. The next day he left Beijing for Juyong Pass. The objective was a short, sharp march west to Datong via the Xuanfu garrison, a campaign into the steppe and then a return to Beijing by a southerly route through Yuzhou. Initially the march was mired by heavy rain. At Juyong Pass the civil officials and generals wanted to halt and send the emperor back to Beijing, but their opinions were overruled by Wang Zhen. On August 16, the army came upon the corpse-strewn battlefield of Yanghe. When it reached Datong on August 18, reports from garrison commanders persuaded Wang Zhen that a campaign into the steppe would be too dangerous. The \\"expedition\\" was declared to have reached a victorious conclusion and on August 20 the army set out back toward China proper.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The given data set provides several key aspects of Cocum, which appears to be a dining establishment. A detailed description of the data points is provided below. 1. EatType: Pub - Cocum is characterized as a pub, which indicates that it is a casual dining establishment that serves both food and alcoholic beverages. Pubs, traditionally a community gathering spot, serve a wide range of dishes and drinks, often with a focus on locally sourced ingredients and regional cuisine. The pub atmosphere is typically informal and lively, making it an ideal destination for friends, families, and coworkers to meet, socialize, and enjoy a relaxed meal or drink together. 2. PriceRange: More than £30 - Cocum's price range is classified as more than £30, suggesting that the dining experience may be slightly upscale or that the menu offerings are perhaps more elevated than what one might find in a budget-friendly establishment. This price point signals to potential patrons that they should expect higher-quality ingredients, more complex or skillful preparations, and possibly a greater level of service than what would be expected at a lower-priced pub. However, despite the higher price range, affordability is still a consideration in catering to a larger demographic. 3. Customer Rating: Low - Cocum's current customer rating is reported as low, which implies that customers who have visited and experienced the establishment may have been dissatisfied with their experience. This less-than-favorable feedback indicates potential areas for improvement within Cocum's offerings, service, or overall execution. A low customer rating can be a strong deterrent for potential patrons seeking a pleasant dining experience, therefore, it is crucial for Cocum to identify the underlying issues and address them accordingly to improve its reputation and attract more customers. 4. Family-Friendly: Yes - Cocum is labeled as family-friendly, which means that the pub makes an effort to accommodate guests of all ages, including children and families with young kids. A family-friendly designation suggests that Cocum offers a welcoming atmosphere, and may have specific provisions such as a kid's menu, highchairs, or other amenities catered to keep younger patrons comfortable and entertained. This emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity can attract a wide range of customers, from families with young children to multi-generational gatherings, further diversifying Cocum's clientele. In summary, Cocum is a pub-style dining establishment with a price range of more than £30 per person, catering to a slightly upscale demographic. While it is family-friendly and accommodates guests of all ages, Cocum's current low customer rating indicates the need for improvements in its offerings or service quality. By addressing these concerns, Cocum has the potential to enhance its reputation and attract a diverse range of patrons seeking a welcoming and enjoyable dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following review positive or negative? This store needs to hire a professional manager with a customer and employee focused background. It is clear from the reviews and recent interactions that this store does not value either of its greatest assets. My brother Shovel S. posted his own review of his experience with this store. He was laying flooring and wanted to rent a floor sander in order to level some rough spots on the concrete before laying hard flooring. When he asked for this tool from tool rental the employee hooked him up with a floor scraper, the kind of device you would use to remove Kool Deck. He went home, read the manual and realized it is not the right tool for the job and went back asking to exchange for the right tool. The tool rental clerk and then an assistant manager were very rude to him and charged him over 100 because he left the store with a tool, even though it was the wrong tool and he didn't/couldn't use it. As if he is supposed to know what Home Depot's iteration of two such similar tools looks like there at the tool desk all wrapped up. He was just trying to get a job done on his precious weekend off. After much argument with the assistant manager who insisted that it was store policy to take his money without providing him the proper tool, he left the store with 109 less dollars than he walked in with and his day wasted. At this point he made a post to social media and I got involved. As a management professional, his story was so appalling that I was compelled to call the corporate number to get to the bottom of why if a tool rental employee gives a customer the wrong tool the customer ends up stuck paying for leaving the store with the employees mistake. The company does not have this policy in any other department. I have returned dead plants, half used cleaning products that didn't really work as advertise etc and had no hassle. Why would an unused rental tool be the subject of such a hard-line policy? While talking to corporate I gave them the store number for the location in Tempe by accident since they are on the same street. The manager from Tempe called me within half an hour but I realized it was the wrong store. I called corporate with the correction. Meanwhile the Tempe manager was quite appalled by what happened and made efforts to get the Laveen manager to make the situation right. The Tempe manager called my brother to reach out. The Laveen manager remained silent. Not a peep. I originally called corporate because the Laveen assistant manager claimed the hard-line policy on the tool rental was a corporate policy. According to the Tempe manager this is not true. I called to let them know that in the age of social media I and 200 of our friends had already seen his post about his experience being robbed and then insulted by the Home Depot manager. We happened to have 2 birthdays in our friend groups this past week and at both events this experience was openly discussed. I also told my neighbor across the street who I am close with. We are big time gardening enthusiasts and we maintain our yards as well as the yards of a couple of elderly and part time resident neighbors on our street just to keep the neighborhood beautiful. I spent nearly 1000 on plants and pool opening products this week and none of was purchased at HD as a result of this experience. The manager at the Laveen store STILL didn't call me or my brother back, despite my brother calling the manager repeatedly and my lodging a formal complaint with corporate and even accidentally getting the Tempe store manager involved! This is uncalled for. Every day this unprofessional manager held my brothers money and did not reach out to resolve what should never have been a problem to begin with was another day we talked, the saga continued to unfold on social media and now onto Yelp and the manager continued to not reach out. Finally, more than 48 hours later, fed up with being in limbo, having had the Tempe manager offer money out of his own pocket because of how ridiculous the situation was, my brother made a last call to Laveen and was finally able to talk to the manager. The manager did not call my brother; he had to call and leave messages repeatedly, have corporate leave messages and have the Tempe manager make calls on his behalf and finally get through because of his own efforts. The manager did process a refund of the 109 but the fact that it took 2 days and numerous phone calls and multiple people involved speaks of a highly ineffective manager with employees not even empowered to \\"make it right\\". If you value your project time, shop at Lowe's or Tempe Home Depot. This store doesn't have its act together and needs to invest in training. With all of the hassle they put my brother through, leaving him with his project still undone, it is my opinion that they owe him more than just a refund. If I was the manager he would have gotten a refund and 24 hours with the right tool on me.","completion":"The review is decidedly negative. It outlines a narrative where the reviewer's brother suffers from not only poor customer service but also ineffective management at a particular store. Several key elements emphasize the negative nature of this review: 1. **Incorrect Product Sold**: The reviewer's brother was given an incorrect tool by the rental employee, which hindered his home improvement project and precipitated the problems that followed. 2. **Poor Customer Service**: When the brother attempted to rectify the situation by exchanging the tool, he was met with resistance from the rental clerk and an assistant manager showing a lack of proper customer service. 3. **Unfair Monetary Loss**: Additionally, the brother was charged over 100 for the incorrect tool - an expense he shouldn't have had to bear in the first place. 4. **Managerial Negligence**: The reviewer highlights that they made multiple attempts to get in touch with the store's management and corporate but were met with silence from the store manager. 5. **Endorsement of Competitors**: This negative experience prompted the reviewer to shop elsewhere, which led them to mention other stores that can better cater to their needs. 6. **Damaged Brand Reputation**: The reviewer discloses that they made the incident known to their social circles and social media, which could potentially harm the reputation of the company. 7. **Inefficient Problem Resolution**: Eventually, the money was refunded but only after significant efforts from the customer, thus highlighting the lack of effective problem-solving strategies from the company. 8. **Recommendation of Company Improvement**: Finally, the reviewer suggests that the store needs to invest more in their training, implying that the mistakes they experienced were due to a lack of staff education. Overall, the reviewer shares a frustrating experience with this store's management, customer service, and handling of mistakes, making the review broadly negative."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding Paragraph: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group likely relies on confusing potential predators, group A or B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators.

What is the answer: Hertz is the standard SI unit for the measurement of what?","completion":"Hertz (Hz) is the standard SI (International System of Units) unit for the measurement of frequency. In scientific and engineering contexts, frequency refers to the number of oscillations, cycles, or repetitions that an event, process, or waveform undergoes in a given period of time. Specifically, one hertz represents one cycle per second. The unit is named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves and their properties. Frequency is a fundamental concept in various areas of science and technology, such as physics, acoustics, electronics, and communication engineering. It is essential for understanding the behavior and properties of periodic phenomena, like sound waves, radio waves, and electromagnetic radiation. In the context of sound waves, frequency is closely related to the pitch of a sound. Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds, whereas lower frequencies correspond to lower-pitched sounds. Musical notes, for instance, can be characterized by their specific frequencies in hertz. In the context of radio waves and telecommunications, frequency is essential for organizing the electromagnetic spectrum and assigning different frequency bands to various transmission channels and types of communication. This is crucial for preventing interference and ensuring the proper functioning of electronic devices and wireless communication systems. In the context of electronics, frequency is an important parameter of alternating current (AC) power systems, oscillators, and signal processing. Engineers must take into account the resonant frequencies and device tolerances when designing circuits and systems. To sum it up, Hertz is the standard SI unit for the measurement of frequency, which represents the number of cycles or repetitions an event or waveform undergoes per second.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.

You'll have to give up work at once and go to bed. Later on, we'll see.\\" Feeling like a man who is in midcareer has suddenly been placed under sentence of death, I left the doctor's office, walked over to the park, and sat down on a bench. I needed to think. In the next 3 days, I cleared up my affairs, then I went home, got into bed, and set my watch to tick off not the minutes, but the months. Two years later, I left my bed and began the long climb back. It was another year before I made it.

I've learned to appreciate those little, allimportant things I never thought I had the time to notice before:the play of light on running water, the music of the wind in my favourite pine tree. I seem now to see and hear and feel with some of the recovered freshness of childhood. How well, for instance, I recall the touch of the springy earth under my feet the day I first stepped upon it after the years in bed. Frequently, I sit back and say to myself, \\"Let me make note of this moment I'm living right now, because in it I'm well, happy and hard at work doing what I like best to do. It won't always be like this, so while it is, I'll make the most of it--and afterwards, I remember--and be grateful.

Let me explain it in a simple way: SSD and HDD are both storage devices for a computer, like a toy box for your toys. But they store things differently. An SSD is like a box with many shelves inside. It's faster to find and put away toys because you can directly go to the right shelf. So, computers with SSD work faster. An HDD is like a box with a toy carousel inside. To find or put away a toy, you have to wait for the carousel to spin to the right place. It takes longer than the SSD with shelves. So, the main differences between SSD and HDD include speed, how they store things, and the way they work.

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends. Today Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is. Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him. As I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too. I love the fact that we have a relationship that can be so open and honest, yet underlined with respect.

Question: What does Sara reveal to Grady? Movie title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.

At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain. Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged? is inside the article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less..., can you guess it ?","completion":"The name of the person in question is Camille Saint-Saëns. He was a French composer, organist, conductor, and pianist known for his numerous compositions and influence in the development of French opera. While two of his operas, Henry VIII and Samson et Dalila, received significant attention during his lifetime, it is only Samson et Dalila that has been regularly staged since his death. Despite the general neglect of most of Saint-Saëns's operas, they are considered important in the history of French opera, as they served as a bridge between Meyerbeer's style and the serious French operas of the early 1890s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This song became their signature and only hit when it was released in 1995. Deep Blue Something was formed in 1991 in Denton, Texas. Band members Todd Pipes, Toby Pipes, Kirk Tatom, John Kirtland and Clay Bergus had a collaboration to form this alternative pop/rock band. The lead vocalist of the band, Todd Pipes, and his brother Toby Pipes, who played the guitar, were the primary creative forces behind the band. The song \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" was a part of their second album \\"Home.\\" It reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart, thus providing the band with their biggest and best-known hit. The song's popularity led to the album's re-release in 1996 by Interscope Records. The song was inspired by the classic Audrey Hepburn film of the same name, although it tells a modern story of a couple considering ending their relationship due to a lack of common interests, save for one - a shared fondness for the film \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". The song's catchy melody and relatable lyrics connected with audiences around the world, contributing to its significant airplay on radio stations and on MTV. However, despite the song's global success, Deep Blue Something couldn't replicate this level of success with subsequent releases, and they eventually faded from the spotlight, becoming what's often referred to as a \\"one-hit wonder\\". In spite of their short-lived claim to fame, the song \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" continues to be a beloved one in pop culture, getting airtime frequently and even being covered by other artists over the years. It stands as a perfect snapshot of '90s pop/rock sound and has since enjoyed a sort of cult status among fans of that era's music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Women consistently lie on social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter to make their lives appear more exciting, a survey has found. The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \\"diary-style\\" social media website. Researchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month. The survey of 2000 women found they mostly pretended to be out on the town, when in fact they are home alone, and beautify about an exotic holiday or their job. The most common reasons for women to write _ included worrying their lives would seem \\" boring\\", jealousy at seeing other people's more exciting posts and wanting to impress their friends and acquaintances. Psychologists suggested that as people attempt to stay connected on social media, they can in fact be left more isolated. They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel. According to the OnePoll survey, one third of women surveyed admitted to dishonesty on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter at some stage. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month while almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30 percent of women lied about \\"doing something when I am home alone\\", almost a quarter overstated their alcohol consumption while one in five were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs. Almost one in five women even lied about their \\"relationship status\\". \\"We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling,\\" said Dr Michael Sinclair, a leading British consultant psychologist. \\"Leaving out the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our 'friends online leads to less opportunity to feel empathized with, resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others. \\" According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because _ . A) they have little fun in their daily lives B) they are not satisfied with their present life C) they want to entertain their friends and acquaintances D) they don't want to go out and communicate with others Answer:","completion":"According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because they are concerned that their lives may seem boring, they may feel jealousy when seeing the more exciting posts of others, and they want to impress their friends and acquaintances. Therefore, the answer that best fits the provided information is B) they are not satisfied with their present life. The passage emphasizes the pressure women feel to present a happier and more exciting life on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. It is suggested that this pressure comes from various sources, including the desire to avoid appearing \\"boring,\\" to compete with others who have seemingly more interesting lives, and to impress people within their social circles. As a result, the passage argues that women resort to exaggerating or outright lying about their daily activities, relationships, holidays, work, and other key aspects of their lives. Notably, the passage also introduces the idea that attempting to portray the perfect life on social media can lead to further isolation and dissatisfaction. Psychologists mentioned in the survey argue that by omitting the less desirable aspects of one's life in online communications, people miss the opportunity to feel empathized with and may consequently feel even more disconnected from others. In trying to present an ideal, happy image all the time, the efforts can become exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling. In conclusion, the passage suggests that women's decisions to lie on social networking sites stem primarily from their dissatisfaction with their present lives and the underlying pressure to create an appearance of an exciting and fulfilling life on social media channels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What self-proclaimed birthplace of surfing announced in 2011 that the activity would become (in 2013) an official college sport? What is the answer?","completion":"The self-proclaimed birthplace of surfing that announced in 2011 that the activity would become an official college sport in 2013 is Hawaii. Specifically, the University of Hawaii (UH) announced that surfing, known locally as \\"he'e nalu,\\" would become an official NCAA-sanctioned sport. Hawaii, often regarded as the birthplace of modern surfing, has a strong and rich history with the sport. It has been an integral part of the Hawaiian culture for centuries, initially practiced by ancient Polynesians who used wooden boards to ride the waves. Surfing was eventually popularized in the early 20th century, with prominent surfers like Duke Kahanamoku, also known as \\"The father of modern surfing,\\" who helped put Hawaii on the surfing map. The University of Hawaii took strides in pioneering the recognition of surfing as a legitimate college sport after it saw an increase in interest and participation among students. The decision was influenced by several factors, such as the growth of various surf leagues and clubs on college campuses, the sport's global popularity, and greater competitive opportunities. This elevation of surfing as an official college sport not only provided scholarships and support to athletes but also helped increase the exposure and accessibility of the sport on a national level. As a NCAA-sanctioned sport, collegiate surfing is governed by standardized rules and regulations while emphasizing safety and inspiring athletes in both their athletic and educational pursuits. The inclusion of surfing as an official college sport has solidified its position within mainstream sports culture and continues to further its reach across the nation and around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I went to Las Vegas last week, and I figured what better way to fill in the after dinner 9PM - 11PM time slot than with a show. I've already seen pretty much all the big named production shows in Vegas, some shows even multiple times even (Cirque Du Soleil's O, Ka, Mystere, Jubilee, Le Reve, Penn & Teller etc). I haven't seen Mystere since the late 90's, so I figured I'd see it again, reminiscing old times. If I remembered correctly, Mystere had a lot going on everywhere, so in order to get the best view, sitting a little farther back from the stage was better. I bought 2 tickets in section 202 center for about 80 a ticket. Not bad for the seats, and price as the view was excellent, especially since it was right in the center! Mystere was made back in 1993 by producer Franco Dragone, with music composed by Benoit Jutras. The same two also teamed up to make \\"O\\" at the Bellagio, and also teamed up to make \\"Le Reve\\" (non-Cirque du Soleil) at the Wynn. Having seen \\"O\\" recently, and \\"Mystere\\" almost 10 years ago, I could see Franco Dragone's creative touches and influences in Mystere that shows up in a larger scale in \\"O\\". Mystere is like Franco Dragone's baby, and \\"O\\" is like the upgraded version of Mystere with water. Franco Dragone must love large stage lifts, as they are seen in Mystere, and also in \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\" but with the additional water component. (Side Note: Franco Dragone and Benoit Jutras recently made \\"House of Dancing Waters\\" in Macao, which from the previews seems like a combination of the best components of \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\". These two are amazing!). I have to mention, the composer Benoit Jutras is a genius. There is nothing like a Cirque du Soleil show with music that we have no clue what they are saying. The music really adds to the shows. As mentioned above, Benoit Jutras made the music for \\"Mystere\\", \\"O\\", and \\"Le Reve\\", in which I love the music for all 3 shows. I'd say if you've already seen \\"O\\" or \\"Le Reve\\" or Ka, you might have to think twice about seeing Mystere. If you really like the circus/acrobatics aspect without the flashy stages, Mystere I'd say has the best acrobatics/circus aspect than O, Ka, or even Le Reve. All the performers in Mystere make it look so easy. If your more into the large stages, then Mystere might be a disappointment. Although considering Mystere was made in 1993, the stage still seems amazing even for todays standards for me. I definitely had a good time, and I was entertained for the full 90 minutes. Maybe its because I saw the 9:30PM show, but I was disappointed to see that a lot of seats were empty, especially on the sides....Options are: [A]. negative. [B]. positive. I think the answer is","completion":"[B]. positive. To describe the sentiment of this review step-by-step: 1. The reviewer mentions they have seen many big-name production shows in Vegas and decided to see Mystere again after a long time. Justification: This establishes their background and experience with similar shows. 2. They talk about the ticket pricing and consider the view from their seat as excellent. Justification: Mentioning the excellent view and the reasonable price indicates a positive aspect of their experience. 3. The reviewer compares Mystere to other shows like \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve,\\" discussing the similarities between their creators. Justification: By highlighting the creators' collaborations and achievements, they are adding a positive context around Mystere. 4. The reviewer praises the composer Benoit Jutras, calling him a genius and expressing their love for the music. Justification: This appreciation for the music adds a positive element to their overall sentiment. 5. The reviewer suggests that if someone has already seen other popular shows, they might need to consider whether to see Mystere, but highlights the superior acrobatics aspect of Mystere. Justification: They provide a balanced perspective, suggesting that Mystere has its strengths, while acknowledging that it might not be for everyone. 6. The reviewer shares that they were entertained for the full 90 minutes of the show. Justification: The fact that they were entertained for the entire duration suggests a positive sentiment. 7. The only negative aspect mentioned is the empty seats, which is not a critique of the show itself. Justification: This observation is not directly related to the show's quality or the reviewer's enjoyment. So, overall the sentiment of the review is mostly positive, as the reviewer enjoyed the performance, appreciated its production, and was entertained throughout."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Research the history of the mining town of Monte Cristo. 2. Identify when the mining operations ceased and the town became all but abandoned. Step 1: Research the history of the mining town of Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo is a ghost town located in the Cascade Mountains in Snohomish County, Washington, in the United States. The town was founded in the early 1890s as a mining community, with gold and silver being extracted from nearby mines. Step 2: Identify when the mining operations ceased and the town became all but abandoned. Mining operations in Monte Cristo started to decline by the late 1890s and early 1900s, mainly due to the challenges of transporting the ore and the decreasing quality of the deposits. By 1907, the town's population significantly decreased, and the railroad that led to Monte Cristo was abandoned in 1920, making the town all but abandoned. In conclusion, the mining town of Monte Cristo ceased operations and became all but abandoned around 1907, with its isolation becoming more pronounced after the abandonment of the railroad in 1920."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How can I be better at physics? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available options: [I] no; [II] yes;","completion":"[II] yes; These two questions are inquiring about the same information. Both questions are asking for advice on how to improve in physics. Now, let's discuss the steps to get better at physics: 1. Understand the fundamentals: Make sure you have a strong foundation in the basic concepts of physics, such as mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and thermodynamics. This will make it easier to build on your knowledge as you progress. 2. Engage in active learning: Don't passively read or listen to lectures; engage with the material by asking questions, discussing concepts, and solving practice problems. 3. Solve a variety of problems: Focus on different types of problems that cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. This will help you develop a broader understanding of physics and improve your problem-solving skills. 4. Be consistent and organized: Set aside some time each day to study physics, and make a schedule to keep track of your progress. Organize your study materials and notes in a way that makes it easy for you to review and understand the contents. 5. Use multiple resources: Don't rely solely on one textbook or lecture series. Consult a variety of resources, such as online videos, tutorials, and forums, to deepen your understanding of the subject matter. 6. Visualize concepts: Many physics concepts can be better understood by visualizing them in your mind or sketching them out on paper. This helps you gain a deeper understanding of the principles at play. 7. Seek help when needed: Don't be afraid to ask your teacher, peers, or online forums for help when you're stuck on a concept or problem. It's better to clarify your doubts early on rather than let them snowball into larger misconceptions. 8. Teach or explain to others: When you explain a physics concept or problem to someone else, it forces you to thoroughly understand the topic and clarify it in your own mind. 9. Review and practice regularly: Periodically review your notes and practice problems to reinforce your knowledge and keep it fresh in your mind. This will help when you come across new material that builds on the previous concepts. 10. Stay curious and perseverant: Embrace the challenges that physics presents and remain curious about the subject. Keep pushing yourself to improve, and don't be deterred by setbacks or difficulties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

First, we need to solve -7154 + 12566. To do this, imagine you have a big jar with 7154 blue balls (these are negative), and you want to replace them with 12566 red balls (these are positive). You take away all the blue balls and still have to add more red balls. You need to add 12566 - 7154 = 5412 red balls to the jar. Now our equation looks like this: 5412 = 164 * c. To find the value of 'c', we need to know how many times 164 can fit in 5412. It's like asking how many groups of 164 red balls can you make from the total of 5412 red balls. So, we will divide 5412 by 164: 5412 ÷ 164 ≈ 33. Therefore, the answer is c = 33. It means that you can make 33 groups of 164 red balls out of the total 5412 red balls."},{"prompt":"Question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental.

The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: People fell in love with Elizabeth Taylor in 1944, when she starred inNational Velvet-the story of Velvet Brown, a young girl who wins first place in a famous horse race, At first, the producers of the movie told Taylor that she was too small to play the part of Velvet. However, they waited for her for a few months as she exercised and trained--and added three inches to her height in four months! Her acting inNational Velvetis still considered the best by a child actress. Elizabeth Taylor was born in London in 1932. Her parents, both Americans, had moved there for business reasons. When World War II started, the Taylor moved to Beverly Hills, California, and there Elizabeth started acting in movies. After her success as a child star, Taylor had no trouble moving into adult roles and won twice for Best Actress:Butterfield8 (1960) andWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? (1966) Taylor's fame and popularity gave her a lot of power with the movie industry, so she was able to demand very high pay for her movies. In 1963, she received 1 million for her part inCleopatra--the highest pay received by any star up to that time. Elizabeth Taylor is a legend of our time. Like Velvet Brown inNational Velvet, she has been lucky, she has beauty, fame and wealth. But she is also a hard worker. Taylor seldom acts in movies any more. Instead, she puts her time and efforts into her businesses, and into helping others--several years ago, she founded an organization that has raised more than 40 million for research and education.

Elizabeth Taylor was born in 1932, which means she was: - 28 years old in 1960 (1932 + 28 = 1960) - 34 years old in 1966 (1932 + 34 = 1966) Step 3: Identify the age mentioned in the question. The question asks for the age when Taylor first became Best Actress. Step 4: Match the age to the answer options.

The incident began two states away from Mississippi, in Georgia, two days before Christmas, when the man attempted -- but failed -- to rob an Atlanta bank, the FBI said. A few hours later and 300 miles west, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the same man robbed a bank. That led to a shootout with police, during which the man fatally shot Tupelo Police Officer Gale Stauffer and wounded another officer, the FBI said Friday. Representatives of dozens of police agencies attended the funeral for Stauffer on Friday, Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre said Saturday in a telephone interview. More than 300 police vehicles participated in a procession in Stauffer's honor. \\"Almost the entire city of Tupelo lined the streets for the procession,\\" iReporter Lee Anne Grace said Saturday. \\"I lost count after 205 police cars, 16 motorcycles.\\" Grace, a music teacher at an elementary school, said she realized she knew Stauffer only after seeing his picture in a news story. \\"Whenever our crossing guard is out, the Tupelo police sent someone to help out,\\" she said. \\"He was usually the one.\\" The eight-year veteran leaves a widow and children, ages 2 and 6. \\"To my knowledge, we haven't ever had a fatality,\\" Aguirre said about his force, which includes 109 officers and two dozen civilian personnel. 1. where did he first attempt the robbery? 2. did he succeed? 3. who was grace? 4. who did the suspect kill? 5. what was he? 6. where was he killed? 7. how many children does he leave behind? 8. how long had he been in the force? 9. did a teacher recognise him? 10. what was her name? 11. had she taught him? 12. how many officers does the force have? 13. how many police cars were in the procession? 14. when did the man trying robbing the bank? 15. how many motorcycles did Lee say there were? 16. did the entire city line up the streets? 17. how far did he travel after Atlanta failed? 18. which direction? 19. how many states is Georgia away from Mississippi? 20. has the suspect been caught?

Staff training must have a purpose, which I defined when a firm considers its training needs, which are in turn based on job descriptions and job specifications. A job description should give details of the performance that is required for a particular job, and a job specification should give information about the behaviour, knowledge and skills that are expected of an employee who works in it. When all of this has been collected, it is possible to make a training specification. This specifies that the training department must teach for the successful performance of the job, and also the best methods to use in the training period. There are many different training methods, and there are advantages and disadvantages of all of them. Successful training performances depend on an understanding of the difference between learning about skills and training in using them. It is frequently said that learning about skills takes place \\"off the job\\" in classroom, but training in using these skills takes place \\"on the job,\\" by means of such activities as practice in the workshop.

Please answer the following question: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost. I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \\"A Time to kill\\" , and the \\"The Newton Boys \\" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work. However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view. The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com. So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \\"A Time to kill\\" , \\"The Newton Boys \\" \\"Frailty\\", \\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\\", \\"Edtv\\" and \\"Amistad\\" and avoid too \\"Larger Than Life\\" and \\"Angels in the Outfield\\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

Available options: [+] no [+] yes","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing. They may seem similar at first glance, but the details and context of the two sentences are different. In Sentence (1), the focus is on Robert Maass. It describes that Robert Maass was born in East Orange, New Jersey, and his parents are German immigrants named Hedwig and Clara Maass. This sentence implies that Robert Maass was born to a couple who immigrated from Germany to New Jersey, and he inherits and possibly studies the German language and customs. In contrast, Sentence (2) is about Clara Maass. The sentence states that she was born in East Orange, New Jersey, to German immigrant parents named Hedwig and Robert Maass. This statement places emphasis on Clara Maass and her German immigrant background. The location of her birth, East Orange, is the same as in Sentence (1), but the focus is on her instead of Robert Maass. To summarize, the two sentences convey different meanings due to the change of focus between Robert Maass and Clara Maass.

I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do. The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first. They didn't move when thunder came across the skies. So I placed their food in their bowls and called Ricky into the kitchen. Ricky was just standing there in place next to his bowl. The thunder became louder, which forced him to stop eating his meal. Then I watched Phil. He made his way across the kitchen floor and stood over Ricky's bowl. He ate all the remaining food. Generally, if Ricky was standing there, he wouldn't dare come close. But today, he took advantage of the storm and got what he wanted. His hope for the prize outweighed his fear of the storm.

Yes or no? Answer: One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of \\"overall health service performance\\", which used a \\"composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution\\", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations. Question: how is canada's health care","completion":"system different from the United States' health care system? The health care systems in Canada and the United States differ significantly, with each country utilizing a unique approach to providing health care services to their residents. The most prominent difference lies in the funding and organization of services. The main aspects that contribute to these differences include the funding models, accessibility of care, administration, and the role of private organizations. 1. Funding Models: Canada has a publicly funded health care system, known as Medicare, which is financed primarily through tax revenues. The federal government sets the overall health policy, but each province and territory is responsible for administering and delivering health care services to its residents. In contrast, the United States has a mixture of public and private funding. Public funding is provided through programs such as Medicare (for individuals aged 65 and above) and Medicaid (for individuals with low income), while private funding is facilitated through employer-sponsored health insurance programs or individual market plans. 2. Accessibility of Care: In Canada, all citizens and permanent residents have access to necessary medical services regardless of their income levels or ability to pay, owing to its universal health care coverage. However, some services like prescription medication, dental care, and vision care might not be covered, and waiting times for certain medical procedures can be long. In the United States, access to health care services is largely contingent upon a person's insurance coverage, which means that those without insurance or with inadequate coverage may face significant barriers accessing care. Moreover, the uninsured population and high costs of care can lead to many people delaying or forgoing necessary medical treatments. 3. Administration: Since the Canadian health care system is publicly funded, it has a lower administrative overhead as compared to the multi-payer system in the United States. The healthcare providers in Canada primarily interact with a single payer (the government) to receive payments for services rendered. In the United States, however, providers usually have to deal with various insurance providers and processes, leading to higher administrative costs and complexities. As a result, the United States spends a significantly larger proportion of its GDP on health care administration as compared to Canada. 4. Role of Private Organizations: In the Canadian health care system, the private sector functions as a supplemental system. Private health insurance can be obtained to cover services not included under the public system, such as dental care, vision care, and prescription medications. In the United States, the role of private organizations is much more significant, as private insurance companies play a lead role in financing and providing health care services, especially through employer-sponsored health plans. Additionally, a large percentage of health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics, are private or run by non-profit organizations. In conclusion, the Canadian and American health care systems differ primarily in their funding structures, with Canada opting for a public, single-payer system offering universal coverage, while the United States relies on a mixed system of public and private funding. These differences result in disparities in accessibility of care, administrative costs, and the overall role of private organizations within their respective health care systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Ann Ree Colton ( Born 1898 ) founded the system of Niscience , a word she coined meaning to know beyond intellectual knowledge , \`\` superconscious knowing , '' she called it . - The New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of \\"spiritual\\" and rarely use the term \\"New Age\\" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term, believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon. As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling.... - Niscience is a religious movement of the United States.

Input: I have 4 enormous ornamental planters in my gardens, which I have planted with purchased annuals for over 20 years. I am very experienced, and these planters have excellent drainage. This year, I switched the potting soil out for Miracle Gro Moisture Control. I flooded the planters before putting the plants in - several times. I planted them, and watered every single day from necessity. This soil product felt moist, but none was shared with the plants - their soil root balls stayed bone dry. The 2 planters in full sun had dying plants. I plunged my arm at least 25 inches down into the planters and the soil was hotter than beach sand, all the way down. This product somehow retains heat and was cooking my plants. When I removed this soil, I was surprised to find big pockets of it that were dust dry. The 2 planters in shade did a little better, but no plant growth whatsoever.

Answer based on context: The Cleveland Browns headed south to the Louisiana Superdome for their Week 7 battle against the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints. Cleveland struck first, on a 23-yard field goal by kicker Phil Dawson and a 4-yard run by running back Peyton Hillis to take a 10-0 lead after one quarter. In the second quarter, New Orleans closed the gap on a Garrett Hartley-yard field goal, but the Browns answered with another Dawson field goal and a 30-yard interception return by linebacker David Bowens to push the lead to 20-3 at the half. Special teams played a large role for the Browns in the half, with a 62-yard punt return by Eric Wright thanks to a Josh Cribbs lateral, and a 68-yard rush on a fake punt by punter Reggie Hodges both leading to field goals. In the fourth quarter, quarterback Drew Brees connected with tight end David Thomas to pull within 10, but another Dawson field goal and a second Bowens interception return sealed the win for the Browns.

Write an article with the title: \\"How to select the right lender when buying a home\\"","completion":"Title: How to Select the Right Lender When Buying a Home Introduction: Purchasing a home is one of the most significant financial decisions most people will make in their lives. Because of the size and complexity of the investment, it's important to choose the right lender when navigating the mortgage process. The right lender can make the home-buying experience smoother, more efficient, and potentially save you money. In this article, we will discuss key factors to consider when selecting a lender for your home purchase. 1. Research and compare loan options: Start by researching various home loan packages available in the market. Determine which type of mortgage best suits your financial situation, whether it’s a fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, or interest-only loan. Compare interest rates, loan terms, and required down payment amounts offered by different lenders. Be sure to inquire about any additional costs or fees associated with the loan, such as application fees, appraisal fees, closing costs, and points. 2. Get pre-approved: After familiarizing yourself with various loan options, approach multiple lenders and get pre-approved. A pre-approval letter demonstrates to sellers that you are a serious and qualified buyer. This process will also give you a better understanding of the loan amount you qualify for and the interest rate you can expect. Remember, obtaining pre-approval does not commit you to a specific lender, and it's a good way of comparing offers from different lenders. 3. Assess lender's reputation: Check lender reviews and testimonials online, focusing on factors such as customer satisfaction, responsiveness, and transparency. Ask friends, family members, or your real estate agent for recommendations. Additionally, you can consult with a professional financial advisor for impartial guidance. 4. Evaluate customer service: When working with a lender, prompt and clear communication is crucial. Be sure to gauge their responsiveness and willingness to answer your questions or address your concerns. The quality of customer service can make a significant difference in your overall experience. Look for a lender who is easy to reach, preferably both via phone and email, to ensure timely and efficient communication. 5. Consider local versus national lenders: Local lenders may have a more comprehensive understanding of your specific market, potentially offering more personalized service and tailored loan options. On the other hand, national lenders may provide a greater variety of loan products and competitive rates due to larger resources and networks. Weigh the benefits each type of lender provides and decide which best suits your needs. 6. Confirm lender's expertise: Ensure the lender you choose has experience handling mortgage loans similar to yours, particularly if you have a unique financial situation or require a specialized loan product. You might need a lender with expertise in first-time homebuyer programs, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, Veterans Affairs (VA) loans, or jumbo loans, as examples. Ask potential lenders about their experience and success rates in managing these specific loan types. 7. Read the fine print: Always read loan documents thoroughly before signing, and make sure you understand all terms and conditions, including any penalties for early repayment or missing a payment. If you are unsure of any aspect of the documents, consult with a professional or request clarification from the lender. Conclusion: Selecting the right lender is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of purchasing a home. By conducting thorough research, comparing loan options, evaluating customer service and expertise, assessing reputations, and reading the fine print, you can maximize your chances of securing favorable terms and a smooth mortgage process. In the end, the right lender will empower you to make informed financial decisions that will best serve you and your new home for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With the world economy currently experiencing a slow recovery from the financial crisis, it is crucial to understand the role of China, the world's second-largest economy, in leading the charge towards financial stability and improved living standards. Economic Growth: Maintaining and Bolstering China's Role in Global Recovery China's rapid economic growth has not only had a significant influence on the national level, but also on the surrounding region and the global economy as a whole. As President Hu Jintao remarked, \\"China's economic growth is of great importance to global recovery.\\" With a determination to maintain a strong economy, China has initiated several measures aimed at realizing this goal, including financial deregulation, domestic consumption stimulation, and economic restructuring. These actions not only have the potential to positively impact the livelihoods of Chinese citizens but also the overall health of the international economy. Infrastructural Development: Investments in Transportation and Energy One essential factor in supporting a nation's economic growth is the improvement of its infrastructure. China has made substantial investments in transportation and energy since the 2008 financial crisis. These investments have increased employment opportunities and facilitated the movement of goods and services across the country. This emphasis on infrastructural development has improved overall efficiency and productivity in China while also raising its GDP, providing much-needed support to the global economic recovery. Trade: Regional and International Integration Trade has been the primary driver of China's economic boom in recent decades, with the nation consistently reporting trade surpluses year after year. By fostering partnerships and economic cooperation, China has indeed become an essential link in the global trading system. At the APEC summit, Hu Jintao expressed his intention to strengthen trade relations with both regional and international partners, which will contribute to global economic stability. Furthermore, China's commitment to lowering trade barriers and increasing transparency within the financial sector should promote a more equitable distribution of resources across the world. Removing excessive trade restrictions and striving for efficient cross-border business procedures will only serve to enhance the global trading landscape. Sustainable Development and Climate Change In his speech, President Hu also touched upon the importance of achieving sustainable development and addressing climate change. He acknowledged that China faces a \\"daunting task\\" of managing its resources and environment. As a major producer of greenhouse gas emissions, China plays a pivotal role in combating global warming and implementing environmental initiatives. With burgeoning economic growth comes the responsibility to ensure sustainability, bolster clean energy initiatives, and transition to a green economy. By investing in renewable energy and implementing policies that minimize pollution and waste, China is actively contributing to creating a healthier planet for future generations. Conclusion: Chinese President Hu Jintao's pledge to maintain economic growth to support global recovery at the Asia-Pacific summit highlights the essential role China plays in shaping the future well-being of the world. As the nation continues to implement policies that bolster its economy, invest in its infrastructure, and champion sustainable development, it is ultimately contributing to an improved global standard of living. China's impact on the global recovery process should serve as an example for other nations to follow in their quest for economic progress and environmental responsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman suffered amnesia. cause:","completion":"In order to determine the cause of the woman's amnesia, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Gather relevant information about the patient's history To understand the cause of amnesia, it's essential to collect information about the patient's medical history, any recent accidents, or incidents they experienced. This can provide valuable context for identifying the cause of her amnesia. Step 2: Conduct a physical examination and review medical tests A thorough physical examination and reviewing any medical test results can provide insight into any underlying medical issues that may be contributing to the patient's amnesia. Tests such as brain scans (MRI, CT) or blood tests can help identify any abnormalities or deficiencies. Step 3: Evaluate for potential psychological factors Assessing the patient's mental health and stress levels can help determine if her amnesia has a psychological origin, such as dissociative amnesia, which can occur after traumatic or highly stressful events. Step 4: Review any medications or substances the patient is using Some medications or substances, such as excessive alcohol consumption or certain prescription medications, can cause transient amnesia. Reviewing the patient's current medications or substance usage could help identify a cause. Step 5: Consider any external factors or lifestyle changes Major life changes, extreme stress, or changes in the patient's environment can sometimes lead to memory issues. Investigating these areas can help rule out external factors as the cause of her amnesia. Step 6: Review findings and identify possible causes After gathering and evaluating all of the information, potential causes can be identified based on the different symptoms, medical and psychological history, and other relevant details. In summary, to determine the cause of the woman's amnesia, it's important to consider her medical history, physical examination results, psychological evaluation, medications/substances usage, and external factors.

To determine if it has a direct or indirect effect, let's examine the process of weathering and the potential implications of using fewer birth control pills. The weathering process: 1. Rain falls on wood 2. The rain seeps into the wood surface 3. It permeates the wood 4. When the rain evaporates, it leaves the wood 5. It takes the finish of the wood with it 6. The wood begins to lose its luster 7. It begins to look bad 8. It has pieces of paint missing from the rain 9. It gets worse when it rains 10. It eventually will have no paint left Now, let's consider the implications of using fewer birth control pills. With less usage of birth control pills, we can assume that there may be an increase in the population, which could lead to higher demand for resources, urbanization, and possibly an increase in pollution. Although there might be some indirect linkages between these factors and weathering, they are relatively weak and far removed from the primary drivers of weathering (such as precipitation, temperature, and biological factors). Considering the steps in the weathering process, there is no clear indication that the usage of birth control pills, either more or less, would have any direct effect on the weathering on wood. In conclusion, while there might be some indirect connections between the usage of birth control pills and the factors influencing woodworking, they are not strong enough to suggest any causality between the two. Therefore, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation does not have a significant effect (direct or indirect) on the weathering process of wood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is Stan?, using the article: During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon.

He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect. and a hint : All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. Please answer this question : Which species would have higher chance of passing their genes on to the next genertion, rhino or impala? A:","completion":"Based on the given situation and the hint provided, it can be inferred that impalas have a higher chance of passing their genes on to the next generation compared to rhinos. Justifying the steps: 1. Define the problem: The problem here is to determine which species, rhinos or impalas, have a higher likelihood to pass on their genes to the next generation, based on the adaptation behaviors they have developed in response to human encroachment of their habitats. 2. Process the Information: According to the details, impalas have adapted certain behaviors that are beneficial to their survival and the survival of their young, while the behaviors rhinos have acquired have not been as successful in ensuring their survival. 3. Apply the hint: The hint implies that animals that have behaviors that increase the chance of survival and reproduction can pass these traits down to the next generation through the process of natural selection. It states that behaviors that increase an animal's fitness make the animal more likely to pass on their genes. 4. Extract conclusion: Given that impalas have developed behaviors that are successful in ensuring their survival and that of their offspring, while rhinos have not been as successful in this aspect, it can be concluded that the impalas have a higher fitness. Therefore, impalas have a better chance of passing on their genes to the next generation.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Rather than face financial ruin, they accepted a restraining order barring them from operating as paranormal investigators and eliminatorsâforcing them out of business. In the eyes of the city, they are now considered frauds. Five years later, Ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children's entertainer with Winston; Egon has returned to Columbia University to conduct experiments into human emotion; and Peter hosts a pseudo-psychic television show. Peter's former girlfriend Dana Barrett has had a son, Oscar, with a violinist whom she married then divorced when he received an offer to join the London Symphony Orchestra. In order to take care of her baby, Dana quit performing and now works as a restorer at the fictional Manhattan Museum of Art, working to prepare a malevolent-looking portrait of a legendary sixteenth-century tyrant named Vigo the Carpathian of Moldavia for an upcoming exhibition. After an incident in which Oscar's baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy intersection, Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help. Meanwhile, Dana's colleague Dr. Janosz Poha has become increasingly obsessed with the glowering image of Vigo in the painting and falls under its spell. Vigo, whose spirit inhabits the painting, orders Janosz to locate a child that he can possess, allowing him to return to life on the New Year. Janosz, infatuated with Dana, offers to bring baby Oscar to Vigo in exchange for Dana, a deal which Vigo accepts. The Ghostbusters' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped.

Answer the following question: Addison put the dishes away after she cleaned up. Given the context: How would Addison feel afterwards? Possible answers: a clean person, sad, accomplished Answer:","completion":"Given the context, it is most likely that Addison would feel accomplished after putting the dishes away and cleaning up. When a person completes a task, especially one related to maintaining a clean environment, it generally generates a sense of achievement and satisfaction. This feeling arises from the knowledge that they have performed a productive action which contributes to bringing order to their surroundings. For Addison, cleaning up and putting the dishes away indicates that she is someone who takes responsibility for her living space and takes pride in maintaining a tidy environment. By doing so, it allows her to have a sense of control over her surroundings and adds to her overall well-being. Although it is possible that a person might feel sad after completing such a task, it is less likely in this context. Feeling sad might occur if the task was associated with an unpleasant memory, or if it was done under duress or against their will. However, there is no indication in the context provided that Addison's actions were compelled by any external factors. Feeling like a clean person is also a valid answer, but it is not necessarily a feeling that would be experienced exclusively after completing the task. Rather, being a clean person is more of an overall characteristic or habit exhibited across numerous actions in daily life. While putting away dishes and cleaning up is one aspect of being a clean person, it does not solely define one's identity in that regard. In conclusion, given the context, it would be reasonable to infer that Addison feels accomplished after putting the dishes away and cleaning up. This sense of achievement is likely to stem from her recognition that she has completed a valuable task, contributing to the orderliness and cleanliness of her living environment."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. suppose the wood will be more moist happens, how will it affect MORE/FASTER weathering occurring.

What are some examples Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"A compound subject and a compound predicate are parts of a sentence structure that involve two or more subjects and predicates respectively. They are used to combine multiple subjects or predicates to form a more complex sentence. Each part serves a specific purpose within a sentence. A compound subject consists of two or more simple subjects joined together by a conjunction, such as \\"and\\" or \\"or.\\" These simple subjects share the same predicate and describe what the sentence is about. In a compound subject, each simple subject maintains its unique identity within the sentence, but contributes to a unified meaning. For example, in the sentence \\"Maria and John went to the store,\\" the compound subject is \\"Maria and John.\\" Both Maria and John (the simple subjects) are performing the action of going to the store. A compound predicate, on the other hand, occurs when two or more predicates describe actions or states of being related to the same subject in a sentence. These predicates are also joined by conjunctions, such as \\"and,\\" \\"or,\\" or \\"but.\\" A compound predicate allows for the expression of multiple actions or attributes related to the same subject. For example, in the sentence \\"The dog barked and wagged its tail,\\" the compound predicate is \\"barked and wagged its tail.\\" Both actions (barking and wagging) are attributed to the same subject, which is the dog. Now, regarding the two questions: 1. What is a compound subject and compound predicate? 2. What is a compound subject and compound predicate? What are some examples? Option (B) is the correct answer. Both questions indeed have the same meaning, as they inquire about the definitions of compound subjects and compound predicates. The only difference between the two questions is that the second one requests examples. This inclusion of examples does not alter the main focus of the question, which is the meaning of these grammatical concepts.

What is the theory of evolution by natural selection and what are some examples? What is biological evolution by natural selection? What are some examples? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The theory of evolution by natural selection and biological evolution by natural selection refer to the same concept. Both questions essentially have the same meaning, and they are inquiring about the process through which species evolve and adapt over time due to natural selection pressures. The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century. This theory describes the process by which organisms change over successive generations because of differences in their inherited traits, allowing for specific adaptations to their environments. The main components of this process are variation, inheritance, selection, and adaptation. Step 1: Variation Individuals within a species possess variations in their traits. These variations can arise from genetic mutations, gene recombination during sexual reproduction, and other factors. Step 2: Inheritance Offspring inherit traits from their parents, which helps to pass on specific variations between generations. Step 3: Selection Organisms face environmental pressures, including competition for resources, predation, and changing environmental factors. Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This is known as \\"survival of the fittest.\\" Step 4: Adaptation Over many generations, the advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to adaptations that enhance the species' ability to survive in their specific environment. Examples of evolution by natural selection include: 1. Peppered moths: During the Industrial Revolution in England, dark-colored (melanic) peppered moths increased in numbers due to pollution darkening tree trunks. The dark moths were better camouflaged against their environment, reducing predation by birds. When environmental pollution decreased in the 20th century, lighter-colored moths regained prevalence as they were better camouflaged on now-lighter tree trunks. 2. Antibiotic resistance: Bacteria have been evolving to withstand antibiotics through natural selection. Some bacteria possess genetic mutations that grant resistance to specific antibiotics. In an environment with antibiotic use, resistant bacteria are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the antibiotic-resistant genes to future generations. This example demonstrates an evolutionary arms race between medical science and bacterial adaptation. 3. Darwin's finches: The finches on the Galapagos Islands are probably the most famous case of adaptive radiation. Different species of finches have adapted to specific niches and resources on each island, resulting in the evolution of diverse beak shapes and sizes that suit their specific diets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you're looking for a definite conclusion, \\"Lost Girl\\" Season 5 does assert an answer, but in typical \\"Lost Girl\\" fashion, it does so in a somewhat open-ended fashion. The fifth and final season of \\"Lost Girl\\" focuses heavily on the romantic relationship between Bo and Lauren, who is a human and a doctor. This season sees a significant development in their relationship. Bo and Lauren, played by Zoie Palmer, have had an on-again, off-again relationship throughout the series, much to the delight and despair of viewers who have been shipping them since the beginning. They have overcome various obstacles, including Lauren's initial affiliation with the Fae-obsessed organization known as the Light Fae, her financial troubles, her relationship with the duplicitous Evony, and Bo's own commitment issues and succubus nature, which pose significant challenges to their relationship. In Season 5, Bo and Lauren are faced with more threats and challenges. Notably, Hades – who reveals himself as Bo's father – is a significant antagonist whom they must confront together. Issues related to Lauren’s mortality also come to the fore, as she is a human in a relationship with an immortal Fae. Despite all these obstacles, they are able to confront their fears and vulnerabilities, which strengthened their relationship. By the end of the series, viewers see Bo and Lauren decide to stay together despite the dangers and challenges of their inter-species relationship. While the series finale hints that there are likely further adventures (and troubles) in store for them but doesn’t exactly wrap up their story in a neat bow. So, to answer your question, Bo ultimately ends up with Lauren by the end of \\"Lost Girl\\" Season 5. Their relationship proves to be an enduring aspect of the series, despite many trials and turbulences, suggesting a deep, abiding love between the two characters. The series finale definitively confirms the love and commitment between Bo and Lauren, ultimately satisfying fans who were rooting for them to end up together."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: If there is a pond with tall building around it, where is it unlikely to be?

First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. Overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because Lucy & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very, very sad. Anyway, what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not great casting at all. And the switch from Madeline Zima to Rachel York.... uhhh, like Lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said, this focused mainly just on Lucy & Desi. Had there been more time, had the story been more about Lucy's entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton very briefly instead. Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well, for the most part. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I Love Lucy but isn't an enormous Lucille Ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly mixed with a slight positive leaning. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's interesting look into Lucy and Desi's lives and some aspects they enjoyed, such as the presence of other famous figures in Lucy's life. However, they express concerns about certain casting choices and the abrupt change of actresses for Lucy's character. They also mention that the movie might not have been necessary, as the audience didn't need to know everything about the stars' lives.

Does \\"Patting the girl's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" appear to be an accurate statement based on \\"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Patting the girl's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" appears to be an accurate representation of the original statement \\"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" Both sentences convey the same meaning, which is that a woman is patting a girl's back while smiling at her. However, there is a subtle difference in focus between the two sentences. In the original sentence (\\"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"), the pronoun \\"her\\" refers to the girl's back, and it is already clear that the woman is interacting with the girl. The focus of the sentence is more on the actions themselves - patting and smiling. In the rephrased sentence (\\"Patting the girl's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"), the addition of \\"the girl's\\" explicitly specifies the girl as the recipient of the action, making the connection between the girl and her back more apparent. This slight shift in focus places more emphasis on 'the girl' as the recipient of both the patting and the smiling actions. Ultimately, both sentences are accurate and convey the same overall meaning. The choice between the two would depend on the intended emphasis and the context in which the sentence is being used. The original sentence might be preferable if the focus of the passage is on the actions depicted: patting and smiling. Alternatively, the rephrased sentence might be better suited if the emphasis is on the girl as a character or if the author wants to make her presence more explicit in the scene."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just about every time an article about \\"sugar\\" is published, I get frustrated because of the effort by some to falsely target sugar. Although reporters often ask the Sugar Association for scientific facts and data regarding sugar to use in their stories, the information we provide is rarely included. Often, it's completely ignored because it does not support the preconceived focus of their article. Thus, a tremendous amount of factual, scientifically verified information about all-natural sugar (sucrose) is being left out of today's conversation. And, sugar, the natural version, is too often confused with the more prevalent man-made sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. That's misleading for consumers. And it's bad for advancing a real debate about solving the serious problem of obesity in America. Opinion: The sweet secret that could kill you. I'm talking about a legitimate, credible discussion, supported by government data and independent scientific research, not hysteria and misinformation. Those using inflammatory and baseless phrases like \\"toxic\\" are often more concerned with a sound bite to sensationalize an article or TV appearance, and their claims have more to do with boosting their social media following or selling books than resolving genuine issues of public health. Targeting sugar alone is disingenuous, at best. The most recent example of this trend is a study that appeared in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, and the media storm that ensued, condemning sugar as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease. Consider this: The authors of the study itself concede that an observational study like theirs is not proof of cause and effect. The authors fail to note the weakness of the self-reported data they used to estimate intake levels of \\"added sugar.\\" This inadequacy is demonstrated by the fact that study participants self-reporting higher levels of physical activity had a greater, not the expected lower, risk of cardiovascular disease. And the study's authors also simplistically lumped together all caloric sweeteners as \\"added sugar\\" rather than identifying them individually (more on this in a minute). Yet that didn't stop headlines like \\"Sugar tied to fatal heart problems\\" or \\"Eating too much sugar may be killing you.\\" Sugar not only makes you fat, it may make you sick. These headlines -- and many others resulting from the study -- underscore the problem consumers are facing when seeking factual information on health. Having worked with the U.S. sugar industry for more than a decade, I am becoming more and more dismayed by those habitually providing a megaphone for what \\"some\\" folks are saying while barely giving a thought to whether these claims reflect a consensus view that is either prevailing among qualified experts or is scientifically correct. Although obsessing about sugar as \\"the\\" problem in our diets gives headline writers everywhere the chance to grab our attention with provocative puns, it undermines the worth of important work regarding other dietary and health concerns. It takes the focus and resources away from us supporting scientifically verified, proven interventions dealing with obesity. The fact is that American per capita consumption of real sugar (sucrose) is lower now than it was 40 years ago by approximately one-third (34%). So of all the things we need to worry about in this world, \\"higher\\" consumption of sugar is not among them. Because we've been consuming less of it for decades. And when critics talk about consumption of \\"sugar-sweetened\\" or \\"sugary beverages,\\" they are often inaccurately lumping sugar -- from sugar cane and sugar beets -- with man-made sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, for example, are different sweeteners. They are molecularly different. With U.S. Department of Agriculture data showing that more than 90% of the caloric sweetener used in beverages in the United States is such corn syrup, not sugar, how can the media, or anyone, continue to call them \\"sugar-sweetened beverages\\"? So Americans just need to remember: Only sucrose, or sugar, is sugar. Sugar has been consumed safely for centuries and, when consumed in moderation, has been and should continue to be part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. That's a fact. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Briscoe. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the actual bill that was the subject of the number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations held by rave and electronic dance music fans? from the following article ? In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. Due to the lack of licensed, legal dance event venues, house music promoters began organising illegal events in unused warehouses, aeroplane hangars and in the countryside. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with \\"repetitive beats\\", due to law enforcement allegations that these events were associated with illegal club drugs. There were a number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations by rave and electronic dance music fans. The Spiral Tribe dance event at Castle Morten was the last of these illegal raves, as the bill, which became law, in November 1994, made unauthorised house music dance events illegal in the UK.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Most substances have three distinct phases: gas, liquid, and solid. Phase changes among the various phases of matter depend on temperature and pressure. The existence of the three phases with respect to pressure and temperature can be described in a phase diagram. Two phases coexist (i. , they are in thermal equilibrium) at a set of pressures and temperatures. These are described as a line on a phase diagram. The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram. A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor. Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone. Dalton’s law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all of the gases present. Q: Temperature and pressure affect changes in phases or states of what? A: The answer is:","completion":"Temperature and pressure affect changes in phases or states of matter, particularly in substances undergoing transitions between their gas, liquid, and solid phases. These changes in phases, also known as phase transitions, include processes such as melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, sublimation, and deposition, which occur under specific conditions of temperature and pressure. When a substance undergoes a phase transition, its physical properties, such as density, energy, and particle arrangement, are subject to alteration due to the influence of temperature and pressure. These factors cause changes in the intermolecular forces holding particles together, which in turn leads to the observed phase transitions. For instance, when a solid is heated, the increased energy and vibration of its particles may surpass the intermolecular forces at a certain temperature, causing the solid to melt into a liquid. Similarly, when a liquid is heated, it may reach its boiling point under certain pressure conditions, allowing the particles to break free of their liquid state and become a gas. Conversely, decreases in temperature or increases in pressure can lead to a gas condensing into a liquid or a liquid freezing into a solid, respectively. Phase diagrams represent the relationships between temperature, pressure, and the various phases of matter. They typically consist of three main regions, representing the solid, liquid, and gas phases, with curved boundary lines between these regions known as phase boundaries. These boundaries indicate the conditions under which two phases of a substance will coexist in thermal equilibrium, meaning that they are at the same temperature and pressure. At the intersection of all three phase boundaries, a unique condition called the triple point occurs, where a substance's three phases coexist simultaneously. To further understand how temperature and pressure influence phase changes, we can consider the concepts of vapor pressure and partial pressure. Vapor pressure refers to the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase, while partial pressure is the pressure a gas would exert if it existed alone within a system. According to Dalton's law, the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of its individual gas components. In summary, temperature and pressure are the main factors that affect changes in the phases or states of matter. By influencing a substance's intermolecular forces and energy distribution, these two factors dictate the substance's behavior during phase transitions, which are represented visually in phase diagrams. The understanding of these phase changes and their dependencies on temperature and pressure has significant implications in various fields, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and environmental science."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Information: - Organized crime is a category of transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals who intend to engage in illegal activity, most commonly for money and profit. Some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, are politically motivated. Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them, such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so-called \\"protection\\". Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered \\"organized\\". A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia, mob, or crime syndicate; the network, subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - The Five Families refers to the five major New York City organized crime families of the Italian American Mafia. The term was first used in 1931, when Salvatore Maranzano formally organized the previously warring factions into what are now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese crime families, each with demarcated territory, organizationally structured in a now-familiar hierarchy, and having them reporting up to the same overarching governing entity. Initially (in the summer of 1931), that governing entity was a \\"capo di tutti capi\\" (boss of all bosses), but that September the role was replaced by The Commission, which continues to govern American Mafia activities in the United States and Canada. - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Carlo \\"Don Carlo\\" Gambino (August 24, 1902 October 15, 1976) was an Italian-born American gangster heavily involved in La Cosa Nostra. Translated as 'this thing of ours', \\"LCN\\" is otherwise known as the American Mafia. He is notable for being boss of the Gambino crime family, which is still named after him. After the 1957 Apalachin Convention he unexpectedly seized control of the Commission of the \\"American Mafia\\". Gambino was known for being low-key and secretive. In 1937 Gambino was convicted of tax evasion but had his sentence suspended. He lived to the age of 74, when he died of a heart attack in bed \\"in a state of grace,\\" according to a priest who had given him the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He had two brothers, Gaspare Gambino, who later married and was never involved with the Mafia and is not to be confused with another Gaspare Gambino who was a mafioso in Palermo, and Paolo Gambino who, on the other hand, had a big role in his brother's family. - Anthony Megale ( August 1 , 1953 -- July 21 , 2015 ) , also known as \`\` The Genius '' , \`\` Tony Connecticut '' , \`\` Machiavelli '' , \`\` Mac '' , \`\` The Brain '' , \`\` Mr. T '' , and \`\` Gas Man '' was a Connecticut mobster who became the acting underboss of the Gambino crime family . - The American Mafia, often referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, (commonly shortened to the Mafia or Mob) and also known as the Italian-American Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (LCN), or the American Cosa Nostra, is an influential, highly organized Italian-American criminal society. The organization is often referred to by members as Cosa Nostra (\\"our thing\\"). It originated and developed from the original \\"Mafia\\" or \\"Cosa nostra\\", the Sicilian Mafia, though eventually encompassing other non-Sicilian Italian-American gangsters and organized crime groups of Italian origin in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The father of American organized crime is generally considered to be Sicilian-American criminal Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. - The Gambino crime family (pronounced ) is one of the \\"Five Families\\" that dominates organized crime activities in New York City, United States, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the Mafia (or \\"Cosa Nostra\\"). The group, which went through three bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, fraud, hijacking, pier thefts, and fencing. - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system. - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\". - Underboss (also capo bastone or sotto capo) is a position within the leadership structure of Sicilian and American Mafia crime families. The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned. - Extortion (also called shakedown, outwrestling, and exaction) is a criminal offense of obtaining money, property, or services from an institution, through coercion. It is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a \\"protection racket\\" since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for \\"protection\\" from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant. - The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States. Flowing roughly southward for through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. Discharging at per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water. What is the relationship between 'anthony megale' and 'gangster'?

Please answer the following question: Information: - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power. - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world. - In the geologic timescale, the Capitanian is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the uppermost or latest of three subdivisions of the Guadalupian epoch or series. The Capitanian lasted between and . It was preceded by the Wordian and followed by the Wuchiapingian. - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\". - In the geologic timescale, the Wuchiapingian or Wujiapingian (from in the Liangshan area of Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province) is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the lower or earlier of two subdivisions of the Lopingian epoch or series. The Wuchiapingian spans the time between and million years ago (Ma). It was preceded by the Capitanian and followed by the Changhsingian. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. - Keratocephalus ( \`\` horned head '' ) is an extinct genus of tapinocephalian therapsid from the early Capitanian age of South Africa . It was found in the Lower and Middle Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone of the Karoo deposits , in the Lower Beaufort Beds in Beaufort West . - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. What entity does 'keratocephalus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: UPDATE: 10:50: This story was updated with the estimated amount of water diverted. It was previously updated with additional context from the Portland Water Bureau. PWB said they started draining the \\"contaminated\\" reservoir last Wednesday, but then started diverted to Reservoir 6 on Monday of this week. Turns out, they didn't flush it all. Yet. More than an hour into a community budget hearing at David Douglas High School in East Portland Tuesday night, Commissioner Nick Fish responded to a neighbor's question about Mt. Tabor's future with an off-topic, but important update on the city's recent internationally famous public urination episode. \\"We will keep the water in Reservoir 6 for now,\\" Fish said. The water, is the so-called \\"contaminated water\\" that made national headlines last week thanks to a Portland area teen. The Portland Water Bureaus started draining Reservoir 5, the crime scene of the alleged urination, on Wednesday of last week. But draining 38 million gallons takes days, and by Monday of this week, just 2-3 million gallons had been drained into city sewers. Water officials started to divert the remaining 35-36 million gallons of water to Reservoir 6 on Monday morning. \\"The rate of draining Res 5 was slow,\\" said public information officer Jaymee Cuti, \\"and we wanted to get it back into service.\\" Fish, who oversees both the Water Bureau and Bureau of Environmental Services, said just last week that flushing the 38 million gallon reservoir was the \\"conservative but correct\\" call. The decision made national headlines, from the Huffington Post to NPR to blogs and wire services across the globe. But on Tuesday, Fish said the \\"urination incident gave us an opportunity\\" to \\"test drive\\" and see whether the city could indeed keep water in the open air reservoirs even after the covered reservoirs at Kelly Butte and Powell Butte come online. Portland is required by the federal government to retire its open air reservoirs, despite years of fighting. Shifting the remaining water also has \\"the added benefit\\" Cuti said of making the vacant Reservoir 6 \\"more attractive.\\" Cuti did not immediately have figures or estimates of the amount of contaminated water that was drained prior to Monday's about-face. Fish said there's no timetable for when the city may flush what remains of the contaminated water. Portland stopped using Reservoir 6 for drinking water in October 2010, according to Cuti. She said the reservoir was \\"valved off\\" for the past few years because the city didn't need the added storage capacity. City surveillance video showed Portland teen Dallas Swonger allegedly urinating in Reservoir 5, one of Mt Tabor's three open air reservoirs. On Tuesday, Fish's comment got lost in the tide of neighborhood advocates pushing for early childhood education funding, better pedestrian safety infrastructure and a slew of other issues near and dear to the hearts of the dozens in attendance at the East Portland high school. But after the meeting, Fish and Commissioner Amanda Fritz said the city decided to divert what remained of the water to Reservoir 6 rather than flush it as planned after careful consideration. The city couldn't flush all the water at once anyway, Fish said, because that would overload the system. So, they apparently settled on shifting the water to nearby Reservoir 6. The reservoir sits parallel to Southeast 60th Avenue, while the kidney-shaped Reservoir 5 is more on the \\"western flank\\" of Mt. Tabor, according to city documents. Both open reservoirs were built in 1911. \\"It's partly an experiment,\\" Fish said Tuesday, calling it a \\"no brainer\\" to maintain the historic feel of the reservoirs. Cuti said the decision also gives the bureau the opportunity to \\"see how water does for long periods of time\\" in the static reservoir. The chief way to do that is to keep water in them. \\"I think that's going to be one of the ideas,\\" he said. Reservoir 6 has a fountain, Fritz said, and could be activated in the future. She said it's unclear how long the \\"contaminated water\\" will remain. \\"But certainly for a while,\\" she said, \\"so that the visitors can enjoy it at no additional cost to the ratepayers.\\" -- Andrew Theen ||||| Portland doesn't flush reservoir water after urine incident PORTLAND – The City of Portland has decided not to completely flush millions of gallons of drinking water down the drain after a teenager allegedly urinated in it. At least, they won’t flush it for now. City officials said Wednesday that about 35-36 million gallons of water from Mount Tabor’s Reservoir 5 has been completely moved to another reservoir in Mount Tabor Park. It will remain there as part of an experiment to see if the city’s reservoirs can be used as water features after they are phased out of use in 2015. Portland made national headlines on April 16 when it announced it would flush 38 million gallon of drinking water into the sewers after a teen was spotted on a security camera apparently urinating in the reservoir. Tests of the water for contamination later came back negative. More: City flushes 175K down the drain In an interview with Vocativ, accused “urinator” Dallas Swonger, 18, said he did not actually go in the reservoir and that the issue seems ridiculous, since he had often observed dead animals floating in the water. The decision was made April 21, as originally reported in The Oregonian, to stop expelling the water into the sewer system and move it instead to Reservoir 5, on the east side of the park, which has sat empty since 2010. \\"We've decided to keep it there to see how long we can keep it clear,” said Water Bureau Spokeswoman Jaymee Cuti on Wednesday. Cuti said that neighbors have expressed a desire to keep the 100-year-old reservoirs as water features or ponds after they are decommissioned. The city’s plan is to observe the water to see how long it can remain free of algae and other growth as a stagnant pool. Portland built new holding facilities at Kelly and Powell buttes after the federal government mandated it replace its open reservoir system with covered tanks. More: Portland to cover reservoirs Cuti could not say what would happen next with the water now in Reservoir 6. “Right now, we are just waiting to see how long it will stay clear,” Cuti said. Reservoir 5 on the other hand, has been refilled and is back online, according to Cuti. In the meantime, work to disconnect all reservoirs from the city's water supply should start later this year. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In a controversial decision, the Portland City officials have decided not to flush millions of gallons of drinking water, which was contaminated by a teenager who had urinated in it.

Mary stopped feeding the cow grass and began to only feed it grain, because the Choices: 1). grass kept the cow healthy.; 2). grain kept the cow healthy.;","completion":"Mary stopped feeding the cow grass and began to only feed it grain because the grain kept the cow healthy. This decision did not come easy to Mary, as she knew that grass was a natural food source for cows and provided essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary for their growth and overall well-being. However, after extensive research, she discovered the numerous benefits of feeding her cow a grain-based diet. Firstly, feeding her cow grain presented a more controlled environment for nutrition. By opting for a grain-based diet, Mary could precisely measure the nutrients her cow was consuming daily. This allowed her to ensure her cow received the correct balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and fats necessary for optimal health, and it also reduced the likelihood of overgrazing, which could lead to soil depletion and an unbalanced diet. Another advantage of feeding grain to her cow was its increased energy density compared to grass. Grain-based feeds have higher concentrations of digestible energy, which meant her cow could obtain the required energy more efficiently. This was particularly beneficial during harsh winters when grass was scarce and the cow needed to put on extra weight to stay warm. Mary also discovered that feeding grain could improve her cow's milk production. Unlike grass, certain grains have higher levels of fermentable carbohydrates, and by carefully selecting the appropriate grain type, she could potentially increase her cow's milk yield. This was hugely beneficial, as the cow’s additional milk production could contribute to a prosperous dairy business for Mary. Moreover, the availability and affordability of grain-based feeds played a significant role in Mary’s decision to transition from grass. Since grain can be easily stored and transported, it ensured a consistent supply of feed, allowing her to plan and budget accordingly. Additionally, improved agricultural practices, subsidies, and advancements in technology have enabled grain prices to become more competitive, making them an increasingly attractive feed option. However, Mary was also well aware of the potential downsides of feeding her cow only grain; she understood that cows have a complex digestive system that is naturally inclined to process fibrous plants like grass. Thus, she knew that transitioning her cow to a grain-based diet required careful monitoring and gradual changes to avoid any digestive problems. Despite these challenges, Mary was committed to providing the best care and feed for her cow. She vowed to stay vigilant and attentive to her cow's health, watching for any signs of digestive distress, and maintaining a strict, balanced diet to promote overall well-being. Through detailed research and careful planning, Mary was confident that making the switch to grain would ultimately benefit her cow's health and her dairy business in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more fallen branches happens, how will it affect the nest will be smaller. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that if there are more fallen branches available, the bird's nest will be smaller. This proposed change in fallen branches can have both direct and indirect effects on the nest-building process. Direct effect: 1. Increase in the available resources: More fallen branches give the bird additional options to choose from when collecting materials to build the nest. As a result, the bird might pick smaller branches and twigs to construct the nest. This selection may lead to a smaller and lighter nest design. Indirect effect: 1. Competition: With more fallen branches around, other birds might also be attracted to the area to build their nests. Increased competition for resources can cause birds to adopt quicker nest-building strategies or change the overall construction efficiency. This might lead to the creation of smaller nests to conserve resources or require less time to build amidst competition. 2. Time and energy management: Given the increased available resources, birds may spend less time and energy searching for materials. Instead, they could focus more on the actual construction process. This reduced time spent on gathering resources might affect the nest's overall size as birds may complete the nest more quickly or preserve energy for other tasks. It is essential to keep in mind that the actual effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the bird's nest-building process might vary significantly based on factors such as the specific bird species, local habitat conditions, and competition levels. In some cases, increased fallen branches might not lead to a significant change in the nest size, while in other scenarios, the consequences might be more pronounced.

Yes, the correct answer is \\"gold\\". However, it is important to note that while wiring can indeed be made of gold, it is not the only material that can be used for wiring. The choice of material for wiring depends on several factors such as conductivity, resistance to corrosion, cost, and other properties that are essential for specific applications. Wiring can be made of various metals or alloys, each with different attributes that make them suitable for different purposes. Some common materials used in wiring include: 1. Copper: The most extensively used material for wiring due to its high conductivity, ductility, and relatively low cost. Copper is easily soldered and resists corrosion, making it ideal for electrical wiring in homes, buildings, and electronic devices. 2. Aluminum: Lighter and less costly than copper, aluminum has a lower conductivity but is still widely used as an alternative to copper wiring in various applications. Aluminum wiring is often utilized in high-voltage transmission lines and large appliances. 3. Silver: Possessing the highest conductivity among all elements, silver is sometimes used in high-frequency or high-precision applications, such as specific electronic devices, aerospace, and satellite systems. However, silver's high cost and susceptibility to tarnish make it less suitable for widespread use. 4. Gold: As previously mentioned, gold can be used for wiring due to its excellent electrical conductivity, resistance to oxidation and corrosion, and high ductility. Gold is often employed in high-quality connectors, switches, and other components found in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other sensitive electronic circuits. However, the high cost of gold restricts its usage to specific, demanding applications. 5. Tinned copper: This is a type of copper wire coated with a thin layer of tin to help resist corrosion and ensure a longer life span. Tinned copper is often used in marine applications and environments with high levels of humidity or corrosive gases. In conclusion, while gold is a correct answer to the question \\"what can wiring be made of?\\", it is not the only material suitable for wiring. Different wiring materials cater to specific applications, budgets, and technical requirements, and the choice of material must be carefully considered based on the needs of the specific project or situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: Is there any way to unblock yourself on Facebook if someone blocked you? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options are: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"First question: How do I unblock myself on Viber? To unblock yourself on Viber, you must first understand that it is not possible to unblock yourself directly if someone else has blocked you. However, I can provide you with alternative steps to potentially resolve the situation. 1. Contact the person who blocked you through a mutual friend: If you know a person that is friends with both you and the person who blocked you, you can ask that mutual friend to mediate the conversation and try to resolve any misunderstandings. 2. Create a new Viber account: If you cannot resolve the issue through a mutual friend, you can create a new Viber account with a different phone number. With the new account, you can try reaching out to the person who blocked you to see if they would be willing to unblock your original account. Remember, though, that it is essential to respect the other person's decision to block you. If they do not wish to unblock you, it is important to leave the situation alone and move forward. Second question: Is there any way to unblock yourself on Facebook if someone blocked you? Similar to Viber, you cannot directly unblock yourself on Facebook if someone has blocked you. However, there are alternative methods to try and resolve the situation. Here are some steps to consider: 1. Contact the person through a mutual friend: As with Viber, you can ask a mutual friend to mediate the conversation and help resolve any disputes or misunderstandings. 2. Create a new Facebook account: Although not recommended, you have the option to create a new Facebook account and try to reconnect with the person who blocked you. Be cautious with this approach, as it could lead to further issues if the person does not want to be contacted. 3. Reflect on the situation: It's important to consider why you were blocked in the first place. Reflect on your own actions and evaluate whether it is worth trying to reconnect with the person or if it's better to let the situation be. Are these two questions asking the same thing? (1). No These two questions are not asking the same thing because they are referring to two different platforms - Viber and Facebook.

However, the given sentence does not meet this criteria, as it does not threaten any community. Part #3: Classifying Offensive Language Usage: The input has to be classified as 'Offensive' if it contains abusive or discriminatory language towards the community targeted. The phrase \\".. you are retarded and cant make out what i am saying\\" can be considered as offensive as it has a discriminatory term \\"retarded\\" which might be seen as offensive to certain communities of differently-abled people. Therefore, the given statement meets the criteria of 'Offensive' content. Part #4: Classifying the 'Normal' Usage: Any text that does not contain either hate speech or offensive language should be classified as 'Normal'. Since the tweet provided in the task contains offensive language, it would not be classified as 'Normal'. However, a tweet like \\"Had a great day at the beach\\" would be classified as 'Normal', because it neither has hateful nor offensive content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you thought this glorious late summer sunshine was a perfect occasion for picnics, think again. A plague of wasps has struck Britain - and they're heading for a hamper near you. Experts today warned that the late spring and long winter have allowed the stinging insects a long and undisturbed hibernation. Scroll down for video. Attack: Billions of wasps are hitting Britian as the late summer brings them abundant food supplies. Experts said that after a few bad years for wasps caused by a run of dreary, wet summers, this year's conditions had given the creatures a boost - contributing to a population explosion that is only starting to unleash its full effect. Billions of the airborne menaces are. emerging from their nests and taking to the skies for their annual. feeding frenzy around three weeks later than in previous years. A. bumper crop of fruit this year is likely to keep the creatures going. until they either die or go into hibernation after the Autumn. And. with plenty of insects to feed on and a dry end to the summer - not to. mention all those sugary drinks lying around by people making the most. of a sunny end to the summer holidays - the wasps are more than making. up for their late arrival. Victim: Susan Bruce with her seven-year-old Cocker Spaniel Betty, who were both attacked by a swarm of wasps. A swarm nearly claimed the life of one cocker spaniel in Tentsmuir Forest near Fife Scotland. The seven-year-old dog, named Betty, went into anaphylactic shock when she was stung more than 130 times. Owner Susan Bruce, 35, who is a vet. with the PDSA animal charity in Dundee, said: 'It was terrifying. They really went for. Betty. There were so many that she was completely covered. 'We tried to outrun them, but they got hold of Betty. There were so many wasps in her coat. Danger zones: the UKWaspWatch site shows London as the area of the UK worst hit by wasps this year. 'We tried to fight them off but they stung us too. It was particularly bad for Betty and she collapsed at the side of the path.' Betty survived after being rushed to the vet, where she was treated with strong steroids and spent the night under observation. When. the vets later posted details of the incident on their Facebook page,. several people replied, saying they had also been attacked by wasps. The hotspot for wasps appears to. be in London, according to pest controller Rentokil, which has set up. an interactive website to allow users to log wasp sightings and rate. them by severity. Swarm: The insects are amassing in greater numbers and later than in previous years. The capital is followed by Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and the South West of England, according to the UKWaspWatch site. Stuart Roberts, chairman of the Bee, Wasps and Ants Recording Society, said: 'Only four weeks ago I was being asked where all the wasps had gone. 'Firstly, we had a really cold winter which meant that hibernation was more successful than usual. 'The. worst thing the wasp queen can have is a warm winter because they. fidget and use up the food reserves. I suspect this has had an effect on. mortality. Sticking around: The wasps are likely to remain on the scene until the end of the Autumn, when they die or go into hibernation. 'And of course, we have had some quite reasonable weather this year. 'This. year I would say the wasps - like everything else in the insect world -. are about three weeks late because of the lateness of Spring. 'The. late Spring, I suspect, has meant they have just stayed in hibernation. for longer, and have been delayed by the cold weather. 'And. simply, a warmer drier summer is good for wasps because for a start if. you have got a really dreary winter, the queen can’t get hold of the. food and you get massive mortality.

Q: Question: When was the person born who had a long feud with FDR? Passage:Roosevelt came to office in 1929 as a reform Democrat, but with no overall plan. He tackled official corruption by dismissing Smith's cronies and renamed the New York Public Service Commission. He addressed New York's growing need for power through the development of hydroelectricity on the St. Lawrence River. He reformed the state's prison administration and built a new state prison at Attica. He had a long feud with Robert Moses, the state's most powerful public servant, whom he removed as Secretary of State but kept on as Parks Commissioner and head of urban planning. Moses was replaced with the Bronx's Democratic Boss Edward J. Flynn. When the Wall Street crash in October 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, Roosevelt started a relief system that later became the model for the New Deal's Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Roosevelt followed President Herbert Hoover's advice and asked the state legislature for 20 million in relief funds, which he spent mainly on public works in the hope of stimulating demand and providing employment. Aid to the unemployed, he said, \\"must be extended by Government, not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of social duty.\\" In his first term, Roosevelt famously said, \\"The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.\\" He was referring to the belief he had that the Federal government would need to use more power in order to bring the country out of the Depression.

Safin was born in Moscow to Tatar parents, Mubin (\\"Mikhail\\") Safin and Rauza Islanova. He speaks Russian, English, and Spanish as well as his native Tatar. His parents are former tennis players and coaches. His younger sister, Dinara, is a former world number one professional tennis player and silver medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. A succession of injuries hindered Safin's progress throughout his career. In 2003, he missed the majority of the season due to a wrist injury. During the 2005 clay-court season, Safin suffered a knee injury, which he played through all the way up to Wimbledon with the help of pain killers and anti-inflammatories. Safin was subsequently defeated in the early rounds of each of the seven tournaments he played between the Australian Open and the French Open, culminating in an early round defeat at the French Open. Safin made a surprise finals appearance at the Wimbledon tune-up tournament in Halle on grass. He lost the final narrowly to the defending champion, Federer. He only played one tournament in the summer hard-court season, in Cincinnati, where he lost in the quarterfinals to Robby Ginepri. He also missed the Tennis Masters Cup. Injuries continued to bother Safin in 2006. Although Safin made appearances at the 2006 ATP Masters tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg, his ranking plummeted to as low as No. 104. He began to recover in time for the 2006 US Open, in which Safin defeated Argentine David Nalbandian, who was then world No. 4 in a riveting second-round match. Safin then lost in the fourth round to former world No. 2 German Tommy Haas, also in a fifth-set tiebreaker. Positive performances at the Thailand Open, where he was narrowly edged out by No. 7 seed, James Blake, and the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, the first all-Russian final at that event, losing to compatriot, Ukrainian-born Nikolay Davydenko, marked Safin's recovery. Despite the injury, Safin still posted 7 wins against top ten players in 2006, fourth-most on the ATP tour behind just Federer (19), Nadal (10), and Blake (8). Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they prevent him from playing?","completion":"Yes, they did in some cases.

Write a summary based on this article: Colleges and universities across the nation are violating federal law by failing to investigate sexual assaults on campus, according to a report released Wednesday by Sen. Claire McCaskill. The report draws on a national survey that collected responses from more than 300 colleges and universities — and uncovered major lapses in staff training and institutional responses to student reports of sexual violence. Text Size - + reset The report draws on a national survey that collected responses from more than 300 colleges and universities — and uncovered major lapses in staff training and institutional responses to student reports of sexual violence. Among them: More than 20 percent of schools allow their athletic departments to supervise cases of sexual assault involving student athletes. More than 40 percent have not investigated a single case of sexual violence in the past five years. (Also on POLITICO: Do Democrats need a Bubba strategy?) And law-enforcement officials at 30 percent of the schools say they’ve received no training in handling reports of sexual assault. McCaskill (D-Mo.) plans to use the findings to inform legislation she’s writing with a bipartisan team that includes Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). They plan to release the bill, which would tighten campus disciplinary proceedings, in late August or early September as students head back to campus. The Obama administration has seized on the issue as well. This spring, the White House released extensive recommendations for campuses to address sexual violence, and the Education Department is in the process of updating the Clery Act, which requires colleges to publicly report all crimes on or near their campus. Public comments on the proposed revisions are due next week. In the meantime, campus administrators and student advocates are poring over the survey results — and pronouncing them both startling and disturbing. (Also on POLITICO: McConnell strikes back on Medicare) “What it tells us is that many schools are not following best practices or even the basics of current law,” said Lisa Maatz, the vice president of government relations for the American Association of University Women. “Schools cannot continue to bury claims and hope students won’t come forward.” But Ada Meloy, general counsel of the American Council on Education, said the report was unfair, shaped and written to “excoriate” institutions. It “ignores how hard colleges and universities are working to address this complex societal issue,” she said, and “ignores the fact that these are incredibly difficult cases to investigate and solve.” McCaskill called out one statistic in particular: More than 40 percent of schools in her sample — including a strikingly high number of private, for-profit institutions — have not investigated a sexual violence claim on campus in the past five years. “Which means they’re saying that there have been zero incidents of sexual assault on their campuses in the last five years. That is hard to believe,” she said. (Also on POLITICO: Castro confirmed to lead HUD) Other findings: — More than 20 percent of the nation’s largest private institutions aren’t investigating all the sexual violence incidents they report to the Education Department. Some campuses report “as many as seven times more incidents of sexual violence than they have investigated,” McCaskill concludes. — Campus law enforcement at 70 percent of colleges said they don’t have protocols on how to work with local police to respond to incidents. — Just half of responding institutions provide a hotline for survivors to report an assault. Eight percent don’t offer any way for students to confidentially report an attack. — More than 10 percent of schools don’t have a Title IX coordinator — as is required by law — to investigate claims of sexual discrimination. — More than 40 percent of the nation’s largest public schools allow students to help determine whether a sexual assault occurred — and to participate in disciplinary proceedings. — Just 16 percent of colleges and universities conduct campus climate surveys to determine the extent of sexual violence. The administration has asked schools to pilot these surveys next year with the goal of making them mandatory by 2016. McCaskill has said she supports that goal. Fatima Goss Graves, a vice president at the National Women’s Law Center, called the findings “startling.” “Too many institutions lack adequate policies, their adjudication systems are not appropriate and they are failing to meet the most basic requirement of having a Title IX coordinator,” she said. McCaskill sent her survey to a nationally representative sample of 350 four-year colleges and universities educating more than 2.3 million students. The response rate was 67 percent. Surveys also went out separately to dozens of the largest public and private nonprofit universities. McCaskill announced in advance that she would not disclose the names of respondents in order to keep their answers honest. The Missouri Democrat has complained that a webinar hosted by the American Council on Education may have dissuaded administrators from responding. Meloy, the ACE general counsel, said that wasn’t the case. But Meloy said she — and many college administrators — felt McCaskill’s survey was biased. For example, the survey questions didn’t offer colleges and universities an option to answer “not applicable.” So, for instance, when the survey asked schools if they educate fraternities and sororities on sexual assault, schools with no Greek life had no choice but to answer in the negative. The survey also uses the words “defendant” and “adjudicate” throughout, Meloy noted, implying that colleges and universities are courts. “We are not,” she said. But Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the survey would be useful. “It will help us identify and fix systemic problems, such as the large number of campuses that currently provide no training for law enforcement, students or employees, as well as the alarming number that leave oversight of some cases to the athletic department,” he said. “Overall, it will be very valuable as we work with Congress and colleges to reduce the number of assaults, bring more rapists to justice, and provide victims with the help they deserve.” McCaskill said she hopes her forthcoming bill will require campus disciplinary bodies to consider sexual assault cases under a “preponderance of evidence” standard, rather than the higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence” that some campuses have been using. She also wants the legislation to empower victims, she said. In addition to Gillibrand and Rubio, the bill-writing team includes Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Republican Sens. Dean Heller (Nev.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.). ||||| OUTRAGEOUS A stunning new Senate report shows nearly half of schools haven’t looked at a single case of rape and 20 percent don’t investigate all the incidents they report to the feds. More than 40 percent of U.S colleges and universities have not conducted a single sexual assault investigation in the past five years, according to a new survey released by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) Wednesday. “That is hard to believe, and obviously very problematic,” McCaskill said. These schools, she continued, were either “in denial or incompetent” with regard to sexual assault on campuses. The visibility of college sexual assault as a problem, and momentum behind the issue, has increased dramatically over the past year. The White House created a task force to combat the campus quandary, Congress has held a series of roundtables to give voice to victims' advocates, and media interest has spiked over sexual assault statistics at top-tier colleges, including the Ivy League. Failure to investigate all sexual assault incidents. Failure to train staff and students to respond to sexual violence. Failure to obtain information about the scope of the problem. Failure to provide sufficient support for victims. These were all problems identified in the first-of-its-kind survey featuring responses from hundreds of colleges and universities, conducted to guide coming Senate legislation on campus sexual assault. More than one-fifth of schools did not investigate all of the sexual assault incidents they reported to the Department of Education. Conflicts of interest were also a problem, the survey revealed. In 22 percent of schools, the athletic department was given oversight for sexual violence cases involving student athletes—something McCaskill viewed as “borderline outrageous.” “It is hard enough to get a victim to come forward when there is at least a perception that the process is going to be fair,” she said. “On some campuses, the athletic departments are the most important entities that exist.” The survey also showed a broad series of problems with the way educational institutions provided support for victims of sexual assault: only 16 percent of colleges conducted anonymous surveys to determine the scope of the problem on campus; just 51 percent of institutions provided a hotline for victims; one-fifth of schools didn’t provide sexual assault response training for members of faculty and staff. The survey was conducted in part to guide the current legislative effort to craft a campus sexual assault bill in the Senate. McCaskill is working with Democratic colleagues Kirsten Gillibrand and Richard Blumenthal, as well as Republicans Chuck Grassley, Marco Rubio, Kelly Ayotte and Dean Heller on a package of reforms she hopes to introduce by late August or early September. The goal, McCaskill said, is to “not make this legislation overly complex… focusing on… empowering victims, supporting victims, [providing] adequate training and [facilitating] coordination with law enforcement.” |||||","completion":"A report released by Senator Claire McCaskill states that colleges and universities across the nation are violating federal law by failing to investigate sexual assaults on campus.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Amanda Clement grew up in Hudson, South Dakota. Baseball was always her favorite sport. Once in a while her brother Hank and his friends would let her play first base in their games. More often, however, they asked her to umpire for them, because they knew her calls would be fair and there would be no arguing. One day in 1904, Amanda and her mother traveled to Hawarden, Iowa, to watch Hank play for the home team against Hawarden. When they arrived at the ball field, two local teams were waiting to play a preliminary game. The umpire hadn't arrived, so Hank argued that the teams should let his sister serve as umpire. The players finally agreed. Amanda, then sixteen and standing five feet, ten inches tall, made perfect calls. She was so good that players for the main game asked her to umpire for them and even offered to pay her. Thus, at sixteen, Amanda Clement became the first paid female baseball umpire of all time. She is honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

It's an odd old schnitzel: the screwy tempi, the Teutonic cast of the orchestra, the somewhat movie soundtrack result are the only things that make half-sense of the Humperdinck as a coupling.For that's all we get: a Hummel-gothic children's story that makes for thigh-slapping hoak. Outside the German repertoire, Klemperer would make real sense in Slavic music, modern and contermporary music, but French music left him pretty much defenseless and we wonder if there is any rationale for perpetuating something like this.For the Fantastique: your best bets are Paray (extraoridinary), Munch, Argenta, Markevitch, Martinon. For the Humperdinck, keep it at a filler level and take your pick or chances, whichever. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review seems to depict the product in a largely unflattering light. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of the product and questions why someone would want it unless they are a \\"Klemperer completist,\\" implying that only fans dedicated to collecting every piece of Klemperer's work would find it desirable. They describe it as an \\"odd old schnitzel,\\" with \\"screwy tempi,\\" a \\"Teutonic cast,\\" and compare it to a movie soundtrack - it's unclear whether these comments are meant negatively, but given the overall tone of the review, it's a safe assumption that they are. The reviewer also criticizes the chosen coupling of Humperdinck, describing it as a \\"Hummel-gothic children's story\\" that results in something akin to \\"thigh-slapping hoak.\\" Again, this seems to paint the product negatively. Furthermore, the reviewer suggests that this particular product leaves Klemperer \\"pretty much defenseless\\" outside of the German repertoire, and they question the rationale behind continuing to release such products. Finally, the reviewer finishes by recommending alternatives for both the Fantastique and Humperdinck, insinuating that better options exist on the market. In both cases, the reviewer seems to suggest that other interpreters deliver better performances. It's important to note that a review is just a single perspective: while this one is largely unflattering, other listeners may have a different impression. However, based on the content and tone of this review, it certainly does not depict the product in a flattering light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A big problem that people have when it comes to dating is rushing into things. You really want to get married, and that's completely understandable, but you have to really make sure that you want to be married to this person for the rest of your life, otherwise it's going to cause problems down the road. It's usually best to give it three months before you start to get more serious. This amount of time lets you get over the initial high (the \\"honeymoon phase\\") and allows to you look at the relationship more clearly. For example, say you meet a nice guy and you've gone on a few dates. Instead of right away trying to hint towards marriage or moving in together, you step back and let things move naturally in that direction. He's less likely to feel broadsided by your need for a husband. Another thing that has a tendency to foul up relationships is too many expectations. If you're coming into a relationship with your entire marriage and life until death planned out, that's a huge amount of pressure to put on another person. Chances are things aren't going to work out in the way you have planned (welcome to life). For example, say you've gone out with a guy for a few dates and you're already telling your friends that he's \\"The One\\" and you're spending all this time fantasizing about your perfect marriage together, instead of spending time with him just being in the present relationship. You have to allow that relationship to develop as it will. There's nothing wrong with daydreaming, or hoping that he might be the man you marry, but you have to make sure that you're grounded in the reality of the relationship. That amazing guy in your head might bear little resemblance to the guy you're actually dating and it will hurt you when he turns out not to be like you've been imagining him. A good way to make sure that things progress further than a few dates is to engage in the things that he's interested in. This doesn't mean molding yourself to what you think he wants, or that you leave your own interests by the wayside. It means that you find out about his interests, ask him about them, and maybe try them out. For example: He really likes to swim. You could ask him about the kinds of swimming he does, how he got into swimming, does he like to compete, and so on. You could even have him help you improve your own swimming techniques. Remember, though, if he is only interested in his own hobbies and never in yours, there are going to be problems later on. He's probably a bit narcissistic and certainly not as interested in you as you deserve. A really important part of creating a lasting relationship is to make sure that you show the other person how important they are to you. He'll feel that he's important to you and that will strengthen your relationship. Tell him what he means to you. Say things like \\"It really means a lot to me that you did all the dishes last night,\\" or \\"Thank you so much for listening to me rant about my terrible day.\\" You can also do little things to show your appreciation: take him out for one of his favorite activities as a surprise, write him a letter with the reasons why he means so much to you. You need to find out whether he's the marrying type and how he might feel about marrying you, in specific. If he doesn't want to marry and that's super important to you, then it might be time to move on and find someone with whom you are more compatible. You can come right out and ask \\"How do you feel about marriage?\\" (Avoid doing that in the beginning of the relationship, otherwise you'll come off way too strong.) It might be better to ease into this question. You could bring up some mutual friends who just got married, or someone at work and say \\"I think that your earlier 30s are a good time to get married, what do you think?\\" If he reacts badly to the idea of marriage, that is not a good sign. You should also pay attention to how he uses \\"we\\" and \\"us\\" in referring to the future. The more he's making future plans with you in terms of a partnership the more likely he is to be looking towards marriage and commitment.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of taking time to evaluate a potential life partner, avoiding rushing into relationships or burdening them with expectations, engaging in shared interests, showing appreciation, and discussing views on marriage to ensure a compatible and lasting bond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While \\"the only true ideas are those of the shipwrecked,\\" it often takes Mankind too much time to unite for the common good, the author suggests, making obvious parallels to the Nazi experience that befell Europe only a few years prior to publication of this novel.Camus weaves his magic subtly, methodically thrusting the reader into a vortex of dark passion, on the premise that discomfort at best, or pure adversity at worst, may be a necessary tonic against complacency. In this way, Camus suggests, The Human Race may finally inch toward living up to expectations - God's, or its Own. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?

Who shared the 1901 Nobel Peace Prize (the first) with Frederic Passy, for his work which inspired the creation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention?","completion":"The 1901 Nobel Peace Prize was shared by Jean Henry Dunant, a Swiss humanitarian, along with Frédéric Passy, a French economist and peace activist. Dunant was the co-recipient of the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize for his instrumental role in inspiring the foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the development of the Geneva Convention. Jean Henry Dunant was born on May 8, 1828, in Geneva, Switzerland. He was a successful businessman before embarking on his humanitarian journey. In 1859, he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, a brutal conflict between the Austrian and Franco-Sardinian armies during the Austro-Sardinian War. Deeply moved by the suffering of the wounded soldiers, Dunant devoted himself to finding ways to alleviate the pain of those affected by war and promote international humanitarian law. Dunant's experiences at Solferino led him to write \\"A Memory of Solferino,\\" a book that detailed the atrocities he had observed and called for the creation of volunteer groups tasked with providing assistance to wounded soldiers, regardless of their nationality. The book had a significant impact in Europe and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. Under Dunant's guidance, the ICRC developed the first Geneva Convention in 1864. This pivotal document established a framework for the protection of wounded soldiers, military medical personnel, and humanitarian aid workers during armed conflict. It also introduced a neutral emblem – the Red Cross – to be used by medical personnel attending the wounded, symbolizing protection under the rules of the convention. Frédéric Passy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his commitment to international peace, particularly through his work as the co-founder of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organization promoting dialogue and cooperation between members of various national parliaments. Passy's influence as a peace activist and advocate for disarmament complemented Dunant's humanitarian efforts. Together, Jean Henry Dunant and Frédéric Passy embodied the spirit of the first Nobel Peace Prize, demonstrating a commitment to reducing human suffering and promoting international cooperation in times of conflict. Their work, especially Dunant's involvement in the creation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention, has had a lasting impact on international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians and combatants during armed conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name? The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who joined the Party is Shostakovich. Dmitri Shostakovich was a renowned Russian composer and pianist who joined the Communist Party in 1960.

Article: The son of a Lutheran pastor, Albert Schweitzer was born in a small village in Alsace, then part of Germany.By age 29, Schweitzer had already authored three books and made landmark scholarly contributions in the fields of music, religion, and philosophy.He was an acclaimed organist, a world authority on Bach, a church pastor, a head of a theological seminary , and a university professor with two doctoral degrees. At the age of 30, aware of the desperate medical needs of Africans, he decided to become a doctor and devote the rest of his life to direct service in Africa. In 1913, at the age of 38, Dr.Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, opened a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon- then a province of French Equatorial Africa.Not even serious setbacks of World War I, part of which he and Helene spent as prisoners of war in France, _ him from continuing commitment to his job. In 1915,troubled daily by the vast numbers of suffering patients coming to his hospital for help, he experienced as a revelation the idea of \\"Reverence for Life\\" as the elementary and universal principle of ethics that he had been seeking for so long. By stressing the interdependence and unity of all life, he was a forerunner of the environmental and animal welfare movements - Rachel Carson dedicated Silent Spring to him. In 1952, at the age of 77, Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the last twelve years of his life, his speeches and writings emphasized the dangers of atmospheric nuclear test explosions and the suicidal nuclear arms race between the superpowers. After retiring as a practicing doctor, Albert Schweitzer continued to oversee the hospital until his death at the age of 90. To the end, his one frustration was that he had not succeeded in convincing the world to abolish nuclear weapons. He and his wife are buried on the Hospital grounds in Lambarene. Question: Which following statement about Albert Schweitzeris TRUE? Options: A: He began to write books when he was at the age of 29. B: He stopped writing and making speeches after his retirement. C: He and his wife opened a hospital in Alsace D: He was born in 1875 in a village in Alsace. A:","completion":"D: He was born in 1875 in a village in Alsace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The suspect matched the description of a man who, armed with a handgun, had just robbed a Big 5 Sporting Goods store.\\"We have no idea why he did what he did at the construction site, but he did steal firearms and shotgun shells from Big 5,\\" Suhr said.Police believe the man drove from San Bruno to Saint Luke's and they found his vehicle at the scene, possibly a white pickup truck that was being scrutinized by officers Wednesday night.Police searched for a second shooter, but they searched the construction site and believe the man they killed acted alone. No one else was hurt.Several witnesses captured the SWAT action on their cell phones.From his apartment window, Jonathan Morey watched the action unfold at the St. Lukes Hospital construction project.

He says people, on the ground, were running from the shots.\\"Like three shots,\\" Imseeh said.Imseeh moved to San Francisco, two weeks ago, from the West Bank. Morey says snipers set up across the street because they had a clear shot at the gunman.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: After the fall of Napoléon, many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent any new invasion. Thus, Savoy built a series of fortifications in the Maurienne valley in order to protect the major alpine passes, such as the col du Mont-Cenis that was even crossed by, Charlemagne and his father to defeat the Lombarts. The later indeed became very popular after the construction of a paved road ordered by Napoléon Bonaparte. The Barrière de l'Esseillon is a serie of forts with heavy batteries, built on a cliff with a perfect view on the valley, a gorge on one side and steep mountains on the other side. What is the answer to this question: When did many alpine countries develop heavy protection to prevent new invasion?","completion":"Many alpine countries developed heavy protection to prevent new invasions after the fall of Napoléon Bonaparte. The exact date of his fall is April 11, 1814, when he was forced to abdicate the throne, and he was later exiled to the island of Elba. It was during this post-Napoleonic period that countries like Savoy started constructing defensive structures, such as fortifications in the Maurienne Valley, to protect their territories and major alpine passes from potential future invasions. Strategic locations, like the col du Mont-Cenis, which had historical significance and improved accessibility due to Napoléon's development projects, were given utmost priority to ensure robust defenses. Hence, it can be concluded that the heavy protection development in alpine countries began in the early 19th century, shortly after the fall of Napoléon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Petrov has been turning out for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s in Sunday League and the Celtic and Aston Villa legend, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012, is happy to be doing what he does best. He said: 'It's a good laugh and they're competitive games. It's just really nice to be out there playing a proper game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Inspirational Villa hero Stiliyan Petrov playing football again. Stiliyan Petrov looked happy to be back in action playing for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s. 'I've played 90 minutes and my fitness is improving but I need to be patient.' Petrov, 35, has played three times for the team managed by former Coventry defender Dave Busst, who suffered a career-ending injury in 1996, and has scored once in a 5-3 cup win. 'Maybe Sky Sports will show it,' Petrov joked. 'As far as positions go, you have to go where you're needed. Sometimes only 12 players are there. 'The one game, we were winning 2-0 and they had a different man marking me every 10 minutes.' The former Celtic and Aston Villa star has played three times for the men from Shirley in the Midlands. Petrov wears the No 10 shirt and has certainly made his mark in the Central Wawrickshire League Premier One Division with his side losing just one of their last three. Tythe Barn Lane in Shirely is a world away from Parkhead or Villa Park but he's never short of memories. 'I meet a lot of Villa fans and it's great to chat to them, said the man capped 106 times by the Bulgarian national team and who wore the captain's armband representing his country. Petrov, whose leukemia is in remission, wasn't afraid to get stuck in on his return to football. Petrov admitted he is loving being back in the thick of things on the pitch with Wychall Wanderers.

With the disease in remission, Petrov added: 'Everything is fine, touch wood. There are only three months to go on tablets and I'm finished. I'm on steroids until January. 'I'll be there again on Sunday but don't ask me who we're playing.' Wanderers' secretary John Busst - Dave's dad - paid a glowing tribute to Petrov. 'The most amazing thing is that he's such a lovely, down-to-earth chap. He comes along, pays his subs and has a drink with the lads. 'He is amazing. Players of that class, such is their footballing brain, they are three or four moves ahead even if they are only 40 or 50 per cent fit. 'He scored, and it was a good goal. On Sunday, we won our first league game 2-1 and he made both goals.' Petrov officially announced his retirement from the professional game in May 2013 and had a short spell working as a coach with the Villa Under 21 team. Petrov did a lap of honour at the end of the 2012-13 season at Villa Park and also had a charity match last year at Celtic Park with a host of stars, including Hoops legend Henrik Larsson, turning out in support. Petrov got emotional when the Celtic Park crowd gave him a rousing reception in the charity match last year. Petrov spent six years at Aston Villa and captained the club.

The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most?

Choices: - eating - hunger - burp - laughing - food The rationale to choose \\"eating\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"- eating The rationale to choose \\"eating\\" as the answer is based on several logical reasons that directly link the activity of having lunch to eating. These reasons are: 1. Definition: Firstly, the term \\"lunch\\" refers to a meal that is typically consumed during the middle of the day. By definition, it implies that the act of having lunch involves consuming food to satisfy one's hunger. Therefore, the act of eating is a direct and essential component in the process of having lunch. 2. Purpose: One of the primary purposes of having lunch is to meet the body's nutritional needs and provide it with the necessary energy to continue functioning effectively throughout the day. This is achieved through the act of eating, as it allows individuals to consume various types of food that are rich in essential nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Thus, eating is the most appropriate choice as it fulfills the purpose of having lunch. 3. Biological Aspect: From a biological perspective, eating is an essential and inherent mechanism in humans and other living beings. The act of having lunch, or any meal for that matter, involves the consumption of food through the process of eating, which helps satiate hunger and facilitate digestion. Consequently, choosing eating makes sense as it is closely associated with the biological aspect of having lunch. 4. Cultural Significance: In many cultures and societies, lunch is an important meal that is celebrated with family, friends, or colleagues. Enjoying a meal together often creates a sense of togetherness and strengthens social bonds. During these gatherings, eating is the focal point of the event, as it not only satiates one's appetite but also promotes a better understanding and appreciation of different culinary styles and flavors. Therefore, the cultural significance of lunch is closely tied to the act of eating. 5. Comparison with Other Choices: When examining the other options provided - hunger, burp, laughing, and food - it is clear that the act of eating is the most relevant choice when talking about having lunch. Hunger refers to the state of needing food, burp is a bodily function that may occur after eating, laughing is an emotional expression that's not directly related to lunch, and food is a component of lunch rather than the act itself. In conclusion, the rationale behind choosing \\"eating\\" as the answer to the question lies in its direct correlation and relevance to the act of having lunch. It is consistent with the definition, purpose, biological aspect, cultural significance, and stands out as the most appropriate choice when compared to the other options provided. Consequently, if you are having lunch, you would most likely be engaged in the act of eating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Plot title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls.

The Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe. The Austro-Russian–Turkish War, which was ended by the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, resulted in the recovery of Serbia and Oltenia, but the Empire lost the port of Azov, north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. After this treaty the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace, as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of Prussia.\\" Answer:","completion":"The Ottoman Empire lost Little Walachia, also known as Oltenia, in 1718 as a result of the Treaty of Passarowitz, which brought an end to the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-1718. This war was a conflict between the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria and the Ottoman Empire, which had been a longstanding rivalry that extended over centuries. It was fueled by the Ottoman's expansionist goals and the Habsburg's efforts to withstand and repel such advances. During the Austro-Turkish War, the Habsburgs, led by Prince Eugene of Savoy, managed to achieve notable victories against the Ottomans. This included taking over the Banat, Serbia, and Little Walachia (Oltenia) territories. The subsequent Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed the Austrian acquisition of these lands, marking a significant territorial loss for the Ottoman Empire. Little Walachia, or Oltenia, is a historical region located in the southwestern part of present-day Romania. It was an important area for both parties due to its strategic position and resources. Losing this region, along with Banat and Serbia, signaled that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and had become less likely to engage in further aggression in Europe. In the following decades, the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735-1739) unfolded, which pitted the Ottoman Empire against a coalition of Austria and Russia. This conflict ultimately ended with the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739. As a result of this treaty, the Ottoman Empire managed to regain control over Serbia and Oltenia (Little Walachia), reversing their previous losses. However, at the same time, they lost the port of Azov, located north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. The Treaty of Belgrade, in turn, provided the Ottoman Empire with a period of peace lasting for nearly a generation. During this time, Austria and Russia were preoccupied with dealing with the rising power of Prussia, which consequently alleviated any imminent threat to the Ottomans. In conclusion, it was the Ottoman Empire that lost Little Walachia (Oltenia) in 1718 due to the Treaty of Passarowitz, which followed the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-1718. Despite regaining these territories in the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, this episode demonstrated the changing balance of power in Europe, as well as the Ottoman Empire's waning influence and inability to maintain its previous expansionist ambitions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kirjoittaja. - Arvoisa presidentti, Nepalin monarkian lakkauttamisesta ja Katmandussa valitun maolaisjohtoisen hallituksen johdosta Nepal ja Kiina ovat lähestyneet toisiaan väistämättä huomattavasti. Nepalin poliittinen ja taloudellinen tilanne on kokenut merkittäviä muutoksia monarkian jälkeisellä aikakaudella, ja Kiinan tuella on ollut keskeinen rooli tässä prosessissa. Nepalin monarkia, joka oli hallinnut maata vuosisatojen ajan, kumottiin vuonna 2008, mikä merkitsi uuden aikakauden alkua maan historiassa. Aiemmin eristäytynyt ja harvaan asuttu Himalajan kuningaskunta alkoi avautua ulkomaailmalle ja aloitti uuden paikkansa etsimisen kansainvälisessä kentässä. Tämä politiinen murros avasi oven Kiinan ja Nepalin välisten suhteiden lujittamiselle. Maoistijohtoisen hallituksen valinta Kathmandun pääkaupungissa kuvasti Nepalin kansan toiveita muutoksesta ja paremmasta tulevaisuudesta. Hallitus, jolla oli vahvat yhteydet Kiinaan, pyrki rakentamaan uutta kumppanuutta maan pohjoisen naapurin kanssa. Taloudellisen yhteistyön ja kehitysavun kasvu molemmin puolin rajaa vahvisti kahden maan välistä yhteyttä entisestään. Kiina on investoinut voimakkaasti Nepalin infrastruktuuriin, kuten teihin, voimalaitoksiin ja lentokenttiin, mikä on auttanut Nepalia saavuttamaan paremman taloudellisen kehityksen. Suhteilla Kiinaan on ollut myös strategista merkitystä molemmille maille, kun ne pyrkivät tasapainottamaan Intian kasvavaa taloudellista ja poliittista vaikutusvaltaa alueella. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Nepalin monarkian lakkauttaminen ja maolaisjohtoisen hallituksen valinta Katmandussa ovat johtaneet siihen, että Kiinan ja Nepalin väliset suhteet ovat lähentyneet merkittävästi.

In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Context: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: who stuck the needle in the boy's arm? Options: A. the boy himself B. the boy's mom C. not enough information D.

Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identifying the task Usage: Divide the given review into two classes: negative or positive. Example: In this task, we need to classify the review as either negative or positive based on its content. The review talks about a disappointing experience with the product, so it can be classified as negative because the customer expressed dissatisfaction. Part #2: Analyzing the review content Usage: Examine the tone, words and overall sentiment of the review. Example: The phrases \\"the first time I tried purchasing a food product over the internet\\" and \\"as feared\\" show the reluctance and suspicion the customer had initially. The customer also states, \\"Not going to bother returning a 7 product, but just disappointed,\\" which highlights the negative sentiment of the review.

Summarize the following: You can go with friends if liked but don't take them along if you feel that all they do is distract you or try to convince you to get clothing different from that which you like. If they're good at giving honest advice though, they may be helpful. Find out what clothing is on display and considered currently trendy by browsing various different stores. Having an overview of what's in fashion can help you to get a better idea of what you like best. This means not buying the first things you see––the items will still be there when you go back after thinking about it. Nice, one-off pieces can be found for little money in such stores and these can really add to your look. Many such stores color code the clothing, making it easy for you to find pieces in your favorite colors. A touch of unique is good for your fashion style. For example: \\"I want to get a new skirt, two pairs of jeans, and a white lace sweater today\\". Having specific items in mind will help you to focus solely on what you really want to get, instead of getting distracted on things you don't need or already have in your closet. Choose colors that look good on you and that fit well. Remember that fashion is not worth discomfort, especially not at school.

In Sentence 1, \\"Smother a yawn\\" refers to suppressing or stifling a yawn, which means to hold it back or try not to yawn. Step 2: Identify the meaning of the word \\"smother\\" in Sentence 2. In Sentence 2, \\"The butter cream smothered the cake\\" refers to the buttercream covering the cake completely and thickly. Here, it means to spread or coat something all over a surface.

He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead,he is back to living on a shoestring--a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He is wise about small things,but not about important things.

If you ask what is going on, someone will tell you it's a charity activity. Though this charity program has not yet officially begun for Chinese users, this little green symbol has proven popular among Chinese Windows Live Messenger users. Windows Live Messenger's official blog announced on March 1 that Microsoft was beginning an \\"I'm\\" program in the United States. Every time someone starts a conversation using \\"I'm\\", Microsoft shares a part of the program's advertising income with nine organizations devoted to social causes. With every instant message a user sends, it helps deal with things one feels most interested in, including poverty, child protection, disease and worsening environment. One only has to add a certain code next to one's name for the organization one would like to support. \\"*red'u\\" is for the American Red Cross, \\"*bgca\\" is for Boys & Girls Clubs of America and \\"*unicef\\" stands for the American branch of UNICEF. After a Chinese blogger named \\"hung\\" introduced this program on his blog on March 2, \\"I'm\\" entered the Internet in China with no actual support from Microsoft. Beijing-based Youth Weekend reported that famous IT blogger Keso regarded this program's rapid spread as a successful virus marketing case. He thinks that the success of the \\"I'm\\" program is because it's spread by users without being a bother to others. This answers why \\"I'm\\" has spread so rapidly across the Internet like a virus with almost no advertisement. However, Feng Jinhu from the press center for Microsoft China toldYouth Weekendthat the \\"I'm\\" project is only for Messenger users in the United States. Instant messages sent by Chinese users would not count. This has not affected Chinese Messenger users' interest in the little green symbol. These users hope their instant messages will actually contribute to charitable organizations someday. Question: The following descriptions about the \\"I'm\\" program are correct EXCEPT _ .

Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all.

Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Summarize: The Scottish first minister has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump both before and after his victory in last year's election. Ms Sturgeon will not meet any members of Mr Trump's administration during her current trip to the US. But she said she would not decline any invitation to meet him in Scotland. The first minister, who was speaking after an event at Stanford University in California, said she had not made a deliberate attempt to avoid Mr Trump or his team during her five-day tour of the United States. Ms Sturgeon told the Press Association: \\"This trip has been principally business-focused so we're not going to Washington on this occasion. \\"I fully expect, during his presidency, President Trump will come to the UK and come to Scotland. \\"As first minister of Scotland, I'm not going to decline to meet him.\\" Mr Trump, whose corporation owns two major Scottish golf resorts, is widely expected to make a state visit to the UK later this year. The president's mother came from the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles and he has often emphasised his Scottish ancestry. But Ms Sturgeon stripped him of his role as a business ambassador for Scotland in 2015 after he proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States. She told the Scottish Parliament in November that she stood by her previous criticisms of Mr Trump, and pledged not to maintain a \\"diplomatic silence\\" in the face of any racism, misogyny or intolerance from the president. The two political leaders spoke by telephone in December, when Ms Sturgeon congratulated him on his victory in the presidential election. Ms Sturgeon - who backed Hillary Clinton ahead of the presidential election - also discussed the \\"longstanding relationship between Scotland and the United States\\" with Mr Trump. The first minister's speech at Stanford University made no mention of Mr Trump, with the first minister focusing on the global role she believes Scotland would be able to play if it were to become independent. She also urged the UK government to recognise the \\"right\\" of Scots to decide their own future through another independence referendum. The UK government has already declined Ms Sturgeon's request to be given the powers to hold a legally-binding independence referendum before the Brexit process is complete. It has argued that the focus should instead be on getting the best deal for the whole of the UK in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU - with the prime minister repeatedly saying \\"now is not the time\\" for another vote on independence. But Ms Sturgeon said that position was \\"not sustainable\\" and insisted she was \\"fairly certain\\" there would be another referendum. While the legislation that created the Scottish Parliament reserved powers over constitutional issues to the UK, Ms Sturgeon argued that it was \\"quite a vague term\\" and said the issue had never been tested in court. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he had written to the first minister asking whether these comments suggested she was planning to mount a legal challenge as part of what he described as a \\"war of attrition over independence\\". Meanwhile, John Lamont of the Scottish Conservatives said it was a \\"great shame\\" that Ms Sturgeon has \\"chosen to use her taxpayer-funded trip to America to promote independence, and an unwanted referendum.\\" He added: \\"She may be representing the SNP in doing so - but she does not represent mainstream Scottish opinion.\\" Scottish Labour's James Kelly said Ms Sturgeon should use foreign trips to represent the interests of all the people of Scotland, rather than \\"trying to build up support for a second referendum that the majority here don't want\\". Ms Sturgeon - who insists her visit to the US is focused on trade rather than independence, will be in New York on Wednesday for a series of meetings at the UN. She is also due to give a speech on peace building, as the United Nations considers its response to the gas attack in Syria.","completion":"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon indicated that she would not decline an invitation to meet US President Donald Trump, either in Scotland or during a later visit to the US.

Determine the sentiment: This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewer comments, I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy. Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading, isn't it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I fully expected it to simply be a Drama. I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes. Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is, how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' in the world. Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside but White on the inside. The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written, directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to witness. I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom -Two is going to or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the denouement is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same. My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on. As an audience member, I may learn something or be inspired.","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this text, I will break it down into different sections and evaluate the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) of each. 1.

Given the question \\"How would Robin feel afterwards?\\", is \\"slow and moronic\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"slow and moronic\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would Robin feel afterwards?\\" This question asks about Robin's emotions or mental state after writing something down, and \\"slow and moronic\\" are adjectives that describe cognitive abilities, not feelings or emotions. Instead, we should consider other adjectives that describe Robin's emotional state or mental condition after completing the task of writing something down before they forget it again. A more appropriate answer to this question could involve emotions such as relief, satisfaction, or accomplishment. These emotions encompass Robin's mental state after they have successfully remembered and recorded the thought, showing that they have achieved a task that was important to them. Relief, for example, could indicate that Robin was worried about forgetting their idea, and successfully writing it down eases that anxiety or concern. Satisfaction might suggest that Robin feels pleased with their quick action in capturing the idea before it slipped away. Accomplishment indicates a sense of achievement in completing a task, which, in this case, is writing down the idea before it could be forgotten. In summary, while \\"slow and moronic\\" does not accurately represent Robin's emotions or mental state after writing down their thought, more appropriate descriptors, such as relief, satisfaction, or accomplishment, would better answer the question about how Robin would feel afterwards. It's essential to focus on adjectives that describe emotional states rather than cognitive abilities when responding to questions about feelings or mental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The phrasing \\"A woman wearing a black shirt walks among a crowd in a city\\" is essentially similar to \\"A black clad woman is walking through the streets among a large crowd.\\" There is some room for interpretation due to different structures in both the sentences but the core essence of the action being described remains the same. The first phrase \\"A woman wearing a black shirt\\" corresponds directly to the phrase \\"A black-clad woman\\" from the second sentence. While the sentence doesn't specify that the woman's shirt is black in the second sentence, the term \\"black-clad\\" means that she is dressed in black, which can naturally include a black shirt. The action described by the phrase \\"walks among a crowd in a city\\" is also similar to the action \\"is walking through the streets among a large crowd\\". Both these actions speak of a woman, the subject of the sentence, walking in an urban setting, indicated by the words \\"in a city\\" and \\"through the streets\\". They both mention her walking among a crowd. The only major difference between both sentences is the relatively minor details. The first sentence does not mention how large the crowd is like the second one does, but it is quite a small difference and not enough to completely diverge the meanings of these two sentences. To put it succinctly, both sentences illustrate the same scene--a woman dressed in black, navigating her way through a crowded city.

Understanding the power of selfies and social sharing, the store provides a unique experience that allows customers to snap photographs of themselves trying on clothing and showcase their fashion choices by sharing them online instantly. Integrated iPads are available to make the process easier and more interactive.

These interactive displays uniquely incorporate the brand's ethos with the shopper's journey, providing an enhanced sense of luxury throughout the store. Moreover, the store features RFID tags embedded in clothing that, when placed near a digital screen, trigger an exclusive video showcasing the garment's runway debut. These elements highlight the store's commitment to using technology to immerse customers in the brand's universe, offering them an unprecedented window into the creative process and an emotional connection to the fashion they are about to purchase. Harvey Nichols' Virtual Makeover Mirrors The world of beauty is also witnessing a technological revolution, as demonstrated by Harvey Nichols' state-of-the-art digital mirrors. Designed to streamline the makeup application process, these smart mirrors virtually superimpose makeup products onto customers' faces, offering a glimpse into the desired outcome without having to physically test the beauty products. This virtual try-on process allows shoppers to experiment with different looks and make educated decisions on what best fits their preferences and style.

She taught in Massachusetts for ten years, and was invited to Bordentown, New Jersey to teach in a school. She saw that these communities needed _ education for their citizens, and she took action by creating a free school, one of the first in her state. But later, ignoring her, officials named a male instead as the head teacher. Disappointed, she left her job and moved to Washington D.C., becoming the first woman employed by the US Patent Office. Clara Barton was forever changed by her experience with the army in the Civil War. She saw doctors use leaves when dealing with injuries since they had nothing else. The medical supplies were well behind the army, who were moving faster than their medical supply lines. She brought in a truck of medical supplies that she collected personally some years ago. Miss Barton continued to work on the battlefields throughout the war. She helped in the identification of 13,000 dead Union soldiers. This non-stop work made her fully exhausted, and upon recommendation by her physicians, she traveled to Europe where she recovered energy and enriched herself. While in Europe, and still in poor health, Miss Barton was moved by the hardship on people brought about by the France-Prussia war. She helped in their relief effort, which encouraged her to create the Red Cross, which served the whole army and common people under a neutral flag. Clara Barton returned to America and then began the establishment of the American Red Cross. The US government did not think there would ever be another war after the Civil War. But she convinced them that the Red Cross would be valuable to serve in times of natural disasters as well. This was her lasting legacy , an agency that still provides aid to all people today.

One man draws out the wire, another strengthens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, and a fifth gives it a head. Just to make the head requires two or three different operations. The work of making pins is divided into about eighteen different operations, which in some factories are all performed by different people, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. Ten men, Smith said, in this way, turned out twelve pounds of pins a day or about 4,800 pins a worker. But if all of them had worked separately and independently without division of labor, they certainly could not have made twenty pins in a day and not even one. There can be no doubt that division of labor is an efficient way of organizing work. Fewer people can make more pins. Adam Smith saw this, but he also took it for granted that the division of labor is itself responsible for economic growth and development and it accounts for the difference between expanding economies and those that stand still. In fact, the division of labor adds nothing new, and it only enables people to produce more of what they already have.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Article 2 of Brazil's Constitution defined the roles of both the Emperor and the Assembleia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.The prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct. Regarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.During its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates. These were widely reported and formed a national forum for the expression of public concerns from all parts of the country. It was frequently a venue for expressing opposition... Answer:","completion":"The body that could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government, according to the context provided, is the Assembleia Geral or General Assembly of Brazil. Established by Article 2 of Brazil's 1824 Constitution, the General Assembly was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, serving as the nation's representatives with significant status and authority. The Constitution sought to create a government based on the separation of powers through legislative, moderating, executive, and judicial branches. The General Assembly's numerous prerogatives and responsibilities, as outlined in the Constitution, ensured that it played a pivotal role in maintaining checks and balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it protected. Under Article 13 of the Constitution, the General Assembly possessed exclusive powers to enact, revoke, interpret, and suspend laws. It controlled government finances by authorizing annual expenditures and taxes, approving and overseeing government loans and debts, and setting the size of the military's forces. This body was also responsible for creating offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare, and ensuring adherence to the Constitution, which granted it substantial authority to examine and debate government policies and conduct. In matters of foreign policy, the Constitution mandated the General Assembly's consultation on declarations of war, treaties, and international relations (Article 102). As a result, legislators could leverage these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments, and force reconsiderations of policies. Furthermore, the General Assembly conducted public debates during its annual four-month sessions, providing a national forum to articulate public concerns from all parts of the country.

During the telethon, Stephen Colbert announced that Apple was donating 5 million and Jimmy Fallon added that Albertsons Cos. and Merck each gave 1 million. NBA star Chris Paul also said that the NBA Players Association, which donated 500,000, would match any professional basketball player's donation up to 20,000.

It just loves.\\" Kevin Mazur/Hand in Hand/Getty Images Throughout the hour-long benefit, which was broadcast on four networks, including ABC, celebrities stressed the importance of unity. However, the current politic climate was referenced at several points. In video addresses, Drake admitted that that news cycle recently has been \\"extremely overwhelming,\\" while Beyonce noted that, \\"it's impossible to watch the news without seeing violence or racism in this country.\\" \\"Just when you think it couldn’t possibly get worse, natural disasters take take precious life, do massive damage, and forever change lives, leaving behind contaminated water, flooded hospitals, schools, and nursing homes and countless families are now homeless,\\" she continued. “Natural disasters don’t discriminate.

Wonder also discussed the issue, and had harsh words for climate change deniers. \\"Anyone who believes that there is no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent,\\" he said. The telethon was also punctuated by stars including Kerry Washington, Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs; Oprah Winfrey and Cher; and Justin Timberlake telling stories of those who were directly impacted by the hurricanes, as well as performances in locations around the country. In Nashville, Usher and Blake Shelton sang \\"Stand By Me,\\" while George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton, Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett sang \\"Texas\\" and \\"I Believe\\" from San Antonio. Other performances included Luis Fonsi and Tori Kelly singing \\"Hallelujah,\\" Brad Paisley, Demi Lovato, Darius Rucker, Cece Winans performing \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" and Dave Matthews singing \\"Mercy.\\" \\"This is what we can give people with our donations tonight.

Billy Crystal closed the telethon thanking everyone at all the call centers, and reminding people that the phone lines and donation centers will be open all night. He concluded, \\"This is what America is really all about.\\" Comic Relief USA, the nonprofit behind Idol Gives Back, will manage the donations and distribute them to organizations including the Rebuild Texas Fund, Feeding Texas, Habitat for Humanity and United Way of Greater Houston. Originally, the Hand in Hand telethon was meant to benefit the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. It was later expanded to include those affected by Irma, which hit the southeast this weekend. It has been estimated that the storms caused between 150 billion and 290 billion in damage to Texas and Florida. At least 70 people died during Hurricane Harvey, and 22 deaths have been reported in the U.S. from Hurricane Irma. ||||| At a time when fewer people than ever watch television live, how does a telethon have an impact? By going viral. During Tuesday’s cross-network and cross-platform airing of Hand in Hand: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief, that mission, certainly secondary to that of raising funds to benefit the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, was accomplished seconds into the telecast. Stevie Wonder, the first of the Oscar red carpet’s worth of celebrities to make heartfelt pleas for donations via live feeds in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, and San Antonio, seemed to kick things off innocently enough, with platitudes of coming together “to love” those who have been devastated by the storms, regardless of “political persuasions.” Well, except, Wonder instantly got political. “Anyone who believes there is no such thing as global warming must be blind, or unintelligent,” he said, practically dropping the mic before the show even started. “Lord save us all.” Was it exactly “George Bush doesn’t care about black people?” No, of course not. But it was a potentially polarizing and alienating move at a time when, even as images of the powerful storms and monumental wreckage they caused literally flooded our screens, the impulse, especially from politicians, to call for prayers in lieu of recognizing science has become an exasperated meme. To wit, even after we tweeted out Wonder’s quote, we got responses chiding the singer for “undermining the objective of the telethon by alienating half the country in the first 30 seconds.” Were Wonder’s comments unscripted, like Kanye West’s were in 2005 at the telethon for Hurricane Katrina aid? It’s too soon to know that yet. (It’s not like there was teleprompter copy for Stevie Wonder.) But it’s worth noting that Wonder wasn’t the only celebrity to address the elephant in the room of climate change, raising eyebrows in the otherwise characteristically congenial and earnest—often to a fault—affair. In fact, it was arguably the program’s biggest booking, Beyoncé, who also brought it up—and in a pre-taped video at that, eschewing the idea that at the very least her comments could have been spontaneous. It hints that, for maybe the first time in an event like this, organizers weren’t just amenable to the idea of political truth bombs amidst the sob stories and scenes of tragedy, but explicitly encouraged it. “The effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day. Just this past week you’ve seen devastation from the monsoon in India, an 8.1 earthquake in Mexico, and two catastrophic hurricanes,” Beyoncé said, regally narrating our end times. “We have to be prepared for what comes next.” It’s interesting to look at the way we remember Kanye West’s comments, standing next to a flabbergasted Mike Myers, all these years later. The knee-jerk labeling of “inappropriate” has evolved, generally speaking, into finding it mostly hilarious. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

He took the artifice out of the proceedings, called out the bullshit in the self-congratulation of celebrities who happily rearrange their schedules for events like these maybe because it’s a good deed, but maybe also because in a weird way it’s a status symbol to be invited to present at one of these things, like a christening to the A-list. There was a certain hypocrisy then in soliciting donations to help a government that was systematically failing a targeted demographic of its citizens. And he wasn’t going to stand there and pretend that there wasn’t. It may not have been as incendiary, but Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé making a plea to acknowledge climate change similarly evades any intrinsic hypocrisy. How could all these celebrities, so many who used their voices so loudly in the previous election, stand in front of footage of those floods and not talk about the urgent contributing factor that the party in power refuses to blame? In fact, politics, even in the telethon’s name, slyly pervaded most of the night. “Hand in Hand” refers to both how Americans helped each other regardless of background as the water levels rose, but also how, as a country in an explosive time of cultural divide, we must put aside our politics to assist in overcoming this devastation as one. “National disasters don’t discriminate,” Beyoncé said. “They don’t see if you’re an immigrant, black or white, Hispanic, or Asian, Jewish, or Muslim, rich or poor. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Third Ward or River Oaks, we’re all in this together.” Most speakers, which included everyone from Tom Hanks to Leonardo DiCaprio to Will Smith, spoke about how heartened they were to see discrimination and opposition be cast aside to assist those in need, because that’s what real American values are. It might seem bleak that an event like this would need to repeatedly remind us of that, as if we’re worried that might no longer be our instinct. And it might seem absurd that political parties and agendas, mentioned in speeches from The Rock to organizer Scooter Braun, are even brought into a telethon about weather, but that’s the situation of 2017, upsetting as that is. And the truth is, that’s precisely what a telethon in 2017 needs in order to be effective. The sanitized, emotionally manipulating hodgepodge of montages, testimonials, and musical performances seems dated in an age where viewers seek out and respond to point of view. As news stories poured in about immigrants refusing to be admitted to storm shelters out of fear of being reported, or how racial inequality in major affected cities left low-income communities, and, often, minorities most susceptible to the dangers of flooding, the door was left wide open for charged political statements—even if these telethons aren’t typically viewed as appropriate outlets for that. But times have changed. In fact, the “traditional” elements of this telecast were its weakest points. So much of it is familiar. You could’ve pretty much predicted the set list before the show even began. “Lean on Me”? Check, courtesy of Stevie Wonder. You bet Tori Kelly has “Hallelujah” covered. Usher and Blake Shelton did a competent “Stand by Me,” while the supergroup of Darius Rucker, Demi Lovato, Brad Paisley, and CeCe Winans took us to church from Nashville. The stories of resilience, bravery, and selflessness that the celebrities told dutifully made you cry. Cher and Oprah Winfrey, arm-in-arm, tell a story about a human chain that formed to help an elderly man. Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon have a tragic tale about a little girl whose mother died clutching her, attempting to save her from the floodwaters. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson wring out your tear ducts talking about wide-eyed babies holding onto each other while waiting to be saved from a rooftop, while Julia Roberts and George Clooney remember the man who played the piano while the waters rose in his house: “Let’s make sure there are always songs to fill the air.” In between it all, everyone’s favorite camera shots: the rows of phone banks manned by real-life famous people, fielding your calls for donations. Barbra Streisand, Andy Cohen, Nicki Minaj, Julianne Moore, Ryan Seacrest, Bruce Willis, Robert De Niro, Jon Stewart, Sofia Vergara: They’re all there, and more. We mentioned the impact of these telethons going viral. Gone are the days in which we’ll gather round a TV because it’s amusing to see Marcia Gay Harden answer the telephone. But, as every shot of those phone banks showed, these celebrities were Instagramming the hell out of this telethon—a truly clever way to drum up more reach for these charities. A photo of Sofia Vergara smelling Oprah’s ponytail while pleading for money? Sure! Ryan Seacrest posing next to Daniel Craig? That hotline number is the caption. Roughly 400 selfies with various celebs from Rita Wilson’s account? Yes please. Each gets a like—and hopefully a donation, too. There’s no discounting the nobility and the generosity of any talent that takes part in a massive event like this, which seems like an unprecedented undertaking and monumental achievement—sadly, until the next one comes along. We’re merely commenting on how much harder it is to generate buzz about them as an “event” in a society that, forget any political divides, is more splintered in their pop culture habits than ever. Might the possibility of an impassioned political swipe at Donald Trump lure more viewers to the telecast? Undoubtedly. Look to the moments that have resonated from any recent awards show for proof of that. As they’ve done with this hurricane telethon—and the dozens of aid-generating events like it that have taken place in the past—these famous faces are more than happy to use their clout to raise money and awareness. What we’re seeing as more effective than ever, and perhaps even wish there was more of in Hand in Hand, is them using their voices. In the meantime, their social-media accounts are a good start. ||||| Published on Sep 12, 2017 Stevie Wonder live from Los Angeles performs Bill Withers' Lean On Me for Hand In Hand: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief to aid Harvey and Irma victims in Texas and Florida on September 12, 2017.

The event spanned multiple networks and online. The star-studded telethon which filmed in New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, and San Antonio raised over 44 million and included appearances from Oprah Winfrey, Cher, Justin Timberlake, Billy Crystal, Kerry Washington, Stephen Colbert, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Dwayne Johnson, Beyonce, and many more. The hour-long event began when the legendary Stevie Wonder encouraged working together regardless of race, religion, political affiliation or sexual preference to help those devastated by the storms. Before performing a rendition of the classic Bill Withers tune “Lean On Me,” he took a jab at climate change deniers saying, “Anyone who believes there’s no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent. Lord, please save us all.” Beyonce, a native of Houston, gave a passionate pre-recorded segment, saying, “During a time where it’s impossible to watch the news without seeing violence or racism in this country, just when you think it couldn’t possibly get worse, natural disasters take precious life, do massive damage and forever change lives.” She added, “Natural disasters don’t discriminate. They don’t see if you’re an immigrant, black or white, Hispanic or Asian, Jewish or Muslim, wealthy or poor. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Third Ward or River Oaks, we’re all in this together. Seeing everyone of different racial, social and religious backgrounds put their own lives at risk to help each other survive, restored my faith in humanity.” The telethon generally stayed clear of politics and controversial moments like Kanye West’s “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” comment during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina benefit concert. Instead, there was an overwhelming, genuine focus on unity and encouraging of help to those affected by the hurricane. During the telethon, Colbert broke the news that Apple donated 5 million while Jimmy Fallon said that Albertsons and Merck donated 1 million on top of that. Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul, who was on hand answering phones, said NBA Players Association not only donated 500,000 but said they would match any professional basketball player’s donation up to 20,000. The telethon also included footage from Houston as it tried to rebuild from the aftermath of Harvey and more encouraging, heartfelt words and appearances from celebrities including Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Julianne Moore, Bruce Willis, Sofia Vergara, Justin Bieber, Taraji P. Henson, and more. The phone bank itself was a who’s who of Hollywood. Lupita Nyong’o was active on social media, documenting the event. Jamie Foxx and Catherine Zeta Jones doing their turn on the phone lines @handinhandfund #handinhand pic.twitter.com/RopZPnmA6u — Lupita Nyong'o (@Lupita_Nyongo) September 13, 2017 Texas native Selena Gomez gave a tearful speech saying “no matter who we are, the differences we have suddenly did not seem to matter. Since that day, we have joined together — neighbor helping neighbor, without stopping to think about race, religion or anything else.” Matthew McConaughey, who is also a Texas native, took to the stage and said that we “can’t bring back what they lost, but we can help them know where to take the next step and provide some solid footing for them to place their next foot. A path to stability. To a place where they can rebuild.” In addition to the performance by Wonder, many other musicians and artists collaborated to give stirring, emotional performances. Usher and Blake Shelton did a duet of “Stand By Me” from Nashville while Luis Fonsi and Tori Kelly sang a soulful “Hallelujah.” Brad Paisley, Demi Lovato, Darius Rucker, and Cece Winans performed “With a Little Help from My Friends” and George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton, Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett approriately closed the evening with a performance of “Texas” and “I Believe” from San Antonio. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A special event called \\"Hand in Hand\\" took place with many famous celebrities coming together to help people who were hurt by big storms called Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Is it true that do germany get to keep the world cup based on the following text? The trophy has the engraving \`\`FIFA World Cup'' on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy on which the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language; for example, \`\`1974 Deutschland'' or \`\`1994 Brasil''. In 2010, however, the name of the winning nation was engraved as \`\`2010 Spain'', in English, not in Spanish. As of 2018, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners, with Spain on later occasions written in Spanish (\`\`España''). FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold.

Answer the following question: I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient.

I thought maybe it was my age. After reading every book and article I could find on sex, relationships, and marriage, I started to wonder if maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved. After having felt this way, I can’t stay in my marriage. It’s not fair to either of us. I’m not sure what happened. Did we grow apart? Did one or both of us change?

After a series of defenses against fringe contenders (Hurricane Jackson, Pete Rademacher, Roy Harris, and Brian London), Patterson met Ingemar Johansson of Sweden, the number one contender, in the first of three fights. Johansson triumphed over Patterson on June 26, 1959, with the referee Ruby Goldstein stopping the fight in the third round after the Swede had knocked Patterson down seven times. Johansson became Sweden's first World Heavyweight Champion, thus becoming a national hero as the first European to defeat an American for the title since 1933. Patterson knocked out Johansson in the fifth round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, to become the first man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, seemingly out before he landed flat on his back. With glazed eyes, blood trickling from his mouth and his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson lay unconscious for five minutes before he was helped onto a stool. A third fight between them was held on March 13, 1961 and while Johansson put Patterson on the floor, Patterson retained his title by knockout in the sixth round to win the rubber match in which Patterson was decked twice and Johansson, once in the first round. Johansson had landed both right hands over Floyd's left jab. After getting up from the second knockdown, Floyd abandoned his jab and connected with a left hook that knocked down Johansson. After that, Patterson came on with a strong body attack that wore down Johansson. In the 6th round, Johansson caught Patterson with a solid right. But the power in Ingemar's punches was gone. Patterson won the fight in the 6th round by knockout.

In their second fight on June 20, 1960, Patterson made history by regaining the championship with a fifth-round knockout of Johansson. Their third and final fight took place on March 13, 1961, where Patterson retained his title by a knockout in the sixth round, winning the rubber match.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals.

The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production.

In 1995, Ghostface guest-starred extensively on fellow Clan member Raekwon's debut album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., appearing on almost every song and receiving nearly equal billing. He also contributed songs to the Sunset Park and Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtracks, which would be included on his first solo LP, Ironman, in 1996. The album, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, had a more pronounced soul influence (particularly 1970s soul) than previous Wu-Tang releases, and Ghostface's future albums would continue to feature this stylistic trait. In 2000, he released his second studio album Supreme Clientele. The album was well received by critics and peaked #7 on the Billboard 200. It included \\"Apollo Kids\\", a popular single which featured Raekwon and had a sample of \\"Cool Breeze\\" by Solomon Burke. \\"Cherchez LaGhost\\", another single off the album, became a minor club hit. Supreme Clientele would be a turning point in RZA's influence on his sound, as only six songs are produced by the RZA, compared to Ironman, its predecessor where every song but one is produced by him. Though he contributed fewer beats to the project, RZA personally oversaw the mixing and production of the album as a whole, contributing to Supreme Clientele's unified sound. Ghostface wasted little time in recording his next album, the heavily R&B-influenced Bulletproof Wallets, released a year after Supreme Clientele. Its feature single, \\"Never Be the Same Again\\", featured Carl Thomas and Raekwon. He had another minor club hit with \\"Flowers\\", which featured guest vocals from fellow Wu-Tang members Method Man and Raekwon, and a popular single \\"Ghost Showers\\" which featured Madame Majestic, who also sung on the popular Wu-Tang track \\"Gravel Pit\\".

Rover.com has raised 3.4 million to be the Airbnb of the dog-boarding market. Rover is an alternative to dog kennels, much like how Airbnb offers an alternative to staying in hotels. In addition to announcing the funding today, the Seattle company is also rolling out nationwide, after supporting only a handful of test markets. Airbnb raised a blockbuster 112 million second round of funding last July from well-known Silicon Valley investor Andreessen Horowitz. In comparison, Rover has raised a much more modest round, and has nine employees. Investors in the round include Madrona Venture Group of Seattle, which led the round, CrunchFund, and other angels. On the business side, there’s a big scale difference between the dog- and vacation-rental businesses. Despite the differences in scale, however, Rover’s CEO Aaron Easterly said the market opportunity is massive. Easterly, who most recently worked at Microsoft in its advertising business, estimates the formal commercial dog-boarding market is worth up to 6.5 billion annually, and said that there’s a much larger informal market of people who rely on friends and family to take care of their pooches. He says that together the two are worth closer to 35 billion to 60 billion. That’s a lot of biscuits and squeaky toys. The decision about where to leave your dog when you’re away from home is an emotional one, Easterly noted. People want to make sure that their dogs are happy, and not just locked up in a kennel. On Rover, people can review homeowners’ profiles, so they can get a sense of how the owners would treat their dogs. Additionally, Easterly said, it’s common for the two sides to meet before a stay is booked. Last week, I visited the company in their downtown Seattle offices with my dog, Fletch, to see just how much Rover drinks from the dog bowl. Sure enough, my hyperactive mutt was allowed full access to the office, finding a variety of toys, from tennis balls to stuffed animals. The other four-legged residents welcomed him into their domain, although Easterly’s four-pound Pomeranian Caramel (a.k.a. Chief Rover), was wise to stay out of the way. A developer even offered to take a break to give Fletch a walk around the block. Since launching in Seattle in November 2011, Rover.com has grown to over 10,000 active members in hundreds of cities across the country. It charges between 5 percent and 15 percent for the service, depending on a homeowner’s track record, including reviews and response times. It has already dealt with some issues that Airbnb struggled with early on, like offering round-the-clock support and guarantees. Today, Rover is rolling out a Barkline (providing 24-hour customer service) nationwide to handle any emergencies. Rover also offers a satisfaction guarantee that covers the dog, its owner and the host, in case any problems arise. But there are other requests that come up that are more cookie-cutter in nature. In the video below, Easterly explains how one of the most important topics to dog owners is where their dog will sleep. Out of the 11 dogs he’s hosted, he said the biggest request was for the guest dog to stay in his bed — and sometimes under the covers. ||||| My Rover sitter sent me updates throughout the day and took care of my dog as if she were her own. – Corinna F. |||||","completion":"Rover.com, a dog-boarding platform, has raised 3.4 million in funding to expand its services as an alternative to dog kennels.

Babbitt disapproved of Laylock, who sang in choirs and was merry at home over games of Hearts and Old Maid. He had a tenor voice, wavy chestnut hair, and a mustache like a camel's-hair brush. Babbitt considered it excusable in a family-man to growl, \\"Seen this new picture of the kid--husky little devil, eh?\\" but Laylock's domestic confidences were as bubbling as a girl's. \\"Say, I think I got a peach of an ad for the Glen, Mr. Babbitt.

Here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. A well-defined research question: The scientist should begin with a clear and concise research question that outlines the purpose and parameters of the experiment. This will help ensure the experiment is specifically designed to answer this question and provide valuable data. 2. A controlled experiment: The scientist should set up a controlled experiment, where all variables except the one being tested (in this case, the growth rate of the specific species of plant) are held constant. This is essential to ensure that the results can be directly attributed to the variable being tested and not influenced by confounding factors. 3. Random sampling: To ensure the results are generalizable to the larger population of that specific species of plant, the scientist should use random sampling when selecting plants for the experiment. This helps to eliminate selection bias and ensures the results can be relied upon by other scientists. 4. Replication: The experiment should be replicated multiple times to confirm the results. Replication is essential to establish the reliability of the data and ensure that the findings are not the result of chance or anomalies in a single experiment. 5. Proper documentation: The scientist should record all details of the experiment, including methodology, data collection, and analysis. This makes it possible for other scientists to review the details, understand the process, and assess the credibility of the findings. 6. Peer review: Submitting the research findings for peer review allows other experts in the field to evaluate the methodology, results, and conclusions of the experiment. This peer review process helps to ensure the scientific rigor and validity of the findings. If the scientist's experiment follows these protocols, then the data generated can be relied upon by other scientists as they contribute to the overall understanding of the growth rate of the specific species of plant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Is the community surrounding lake Tresco or lake Mahoe less likely to have contaminated water wells? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The community surrounding Lake Tresco is less likely to have contaminated water wells as compared to the community surrounding Lake Mahoe. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. Firstly, Lake Mahoe is located right next to a large farm that grows various crops for the town. As mentioned in the description, huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields. These chemicals can be picked up by rainwater and runoff, which carries the chemicals to nearby bodies of water, such as Lake Mahoe. This can result in an increased risk of water contamination in the lake and the surrounding water wells. The use of fertilizers on the farm can cause excessive growth of water plants and algae in the lake. This process, known as eutrophication, can lead to dead zones where oxygen levels in the water are too low to support life. In some cases, harmful algal blooms may also occur, releasing toxins into the water that can be dangerous to both humans and wildlife. Additionally, the owner of the farm rents out his barn regularly for celebrations. This means that there may be an increased risk of pollutants, such as solid waste and wastewater, entering the lake from these events, further increasing the likelihood of water contamination in the area. On the other hand, Lake Tresco is located near a school, where children often come to play during recess. While it is possible for some level of water contamination to occur due to human activity (e.g., littering), the overall risk is likely to be lower compared to the situation at Lake Mahoe. There is no mention of large-scale agricultural activity or regular events with potential pollutants nearby, meaning that the community surrounding Lake Tresco has a lower probability of having contaminated water wells. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided and various assumptions. To make a definitive conclusion about the water quality in both areas, water testing and analyses should be conducted by professionals to provide accurate data on the presence and levels of contaminants in the water wells surrounding both lakes. This would help the communities make informed decisions about water safety and potential remediation measures, if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

Background: Dan Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964 in Exeter, New Hampshire. He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1975). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997. Context: After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as \\"Happy Frogs\\" and \\"Suzuki Elephants\\"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School. He also joined the National Academy of Songwriters, and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met Blythe Newlon, a woman 12 years his senior, who was the Academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire. In 1994 Brown released a CD titled Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her \\"for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist\\". The CD included songs such as \\"Here in These Fields\\" and the religious ballad, \\"All I Believe\\". Brown and his wife, Blythe, moved to his home town in New Hampshire in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for K-8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls. Question: When did he become a songwriter?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Dan Brown became a songwriter around 1990 when he self-published a CD entitled Perspective.

The use of the word \\"tired\\" has a negative connotation because it implies exhaustion, fatigue, or a lack of enthusiasm or energy. This is often associated with negative emotions, such as boredom, irritation, or dissatisfaction. 2. The phrase \\"feels familiar\\" suggests that the experience or situation described is something that the person has encountered repeatedly. While familiarity can sometimes evoke positive emotions, such as comfort or security, in this context, the combination with \\"tired\\" makes it seem more like the person is expressing a sense of monotony or boredom, which is typically considered negative. 3. If we examine the context in which this sentence might appear, it could likely be part of a complaint, a criticism, or an expression of disappointment or dissatisfaction. The statement may be indicating that the person is weary of encountering the same old thing and may be searching for something new, exciting, or different. 4. Although the sentence itself does not contain any explicit negative words or phrases, the overall tone and implication of the statement are less-than-positive, and it lacks any of the optimism, hope, or enthusiasm often associated with a positive sentiment.

Add punctuation to the following sentence: 12 medium shrimp peeled and deveined","completion":"To add punctuation to the sentence given, we need to identify the parts of the sentence. Here's the sentence with proper punctuation: \\"12 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined.\\" Step-by-step breakdown: 1. \\"12 medium shrimp\\" - This phrase can act as an independent clause because it has a subject (shrimp) and a predicate (being 12 and medium). Therefore, it is correct to end this part of the sentence with a comma. 2. \\"peeled and deveined\\" - This phrase is a series of adjectives describing the state of the shrimp. In English, we usually separate adjectives with commas. However, in this case, the conjunction \\"and\\" already connects the two adjectives, so no more comma is required. The justification for adding the comma is to break up the sentence into more manageable parts, making it easier to read and understand. The comma after \\"shrimp\\" separates the main clause from the additional information about the shrimp's condition, improving the sentence's clarity."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Humbert Humbert (James Mason) a 40-something British professor of French literature, arrives at the masion which is ramsacked from an apparently wild party the night before and finds the insane and debauched Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), whom is not only suffering from some kind of severe dementia, but is also clearly drunk, as he babbles on incoherently and does not seem to remember Humbert from a time ago. Quilty goes mad when Humbert points a gun at him. After a mutually exhausting struggle for it, Quilty, now insane with fear, merely responds politely as Humbert repeatedly shoots him. He finally dies with a comical lack of interest, expressing his slight concern in an affected English accent. Humbert is left exhausted and disoriented.The film then turns to events four years earlier and goes forward as Humbert travels to Ramsdale, New Hampshire, a small town where he will spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio.

He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney.

The emotions described, such as anger, frustration, annoyance, and jealousy, indicate that the narrator is highly affected by the other person's actions and statements concerning their partner. Taking into account these emotions and the fact that the narrator is bothered by someone else discussing and fantasizing about their loved one, we can analyze the possible options that describe the narrator's temperament: [I] The narrator is unpossessive. This option does not seem accurate, as the narrator's strong emotions imply that they care about their partner and are affected by someone else's claims of ownership. An unpossessive person might not experience these intense emotions in a similar situation. [II] The narrator is jealous. This option appears to be the most fitting, as the narrator's emotions suggest that they feel a sense of competition for their partner's attention and do not appreciate another person's constant talking, fantasies, and claims about their partner. The narrator's jealousy may drive their anger, frustration, and annoyance. [III] The narrator is independent. Independence is not explicitly mentioned in the context provided, nor can it be inferred from the emotions expressed by the narrator. Thus, this option does not accurately describe the narrator's temperament in the given situation. [IV] The narrator is self-confident. A self-confident person might not be as impacted by someone else's talking about their partner or feel threatened by their claims. The strong emotions the narrator experiences, however, indicate that they are not entirely secure in their relationship or their position as their partner's significant other. Therefore, based on the context and emotions described, the most accurate option to describe the narrator's temperament would be: [II] The narrator is jealous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Battle for Terra Movie plot: Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) is a precocious girl living on the beautiful planet Terra, a place where peace and tolerance are celebrated. Unbeknownst to Mala and her fellow Terrians, the last inhabitants of Earth have exhausted the resources of their planet and those of three others, and are now searching for a new home. This Earthforce has discovered that the use of a Terraformer will make Terra habitable for humans but poisonous for Terrians. When the Earthlings embark on a hostile invasion of Terra, Mala's father, Roven (Dennis Quaid), is kidnapped. Hoping to save her father, Mala captures and hides a crashed human pilot named Jim (Luke Wilson). While Mala nurses Jim back to health, the two forge a friendship and a plan that could save both the human race and the planet of Terra. Soon, however, they realize that peace will not be secured unless they can combat both the Terraformer and dark political forces that will stop at nothing in their drive to achieve power for power's sake.While Terra's message that peace is a question of free will and choice is a potent one, the exuberance of Mala and her young friends carries the film. Director Aristomenis Tsirbas paints a landscape of pastoral pleasure, and our admiration for Terra's idyllic vistas is only heightened when they are invaded-martykz-2On a distant planet, Mala and her best friend Senn, members of a sentient, tadpole-like species, skip class to joyride in wooden flying machines that resemble hang gliders.

Chinese state media frequently treats Japan's atrocities of the past like breaking news of today. But lately, the steady flow of war history-related news has become a flood. Amid fast-deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations, China's State Archives Administration recently re-opened case files from a Chinese military tribunal in 1956 and launched a dedicated website to publish summaries of confessions by 45 convicted Japanese war criminals. Among the horrifying accounts posted online by Chinese authorities are confessions of raping countless women, burying people alive and performing human vivisections in China -- all handwritten by captured Japanese army officers after World War II and long sealed in the state archives in Beijing. The Chinese government's target is clear. \\"Since the Abe cabinet came into power in Japan,\\" begins the online introduction to the confessions, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \\"It has openly confused right and wrong to mislead the public, in an attempt to whitewash the history of external aggression and colonialism.\\" Tense seas. China and Japan have a dark history of conflict, including the nine-year Second Sino-Japanese War during which the contentious Nanjing Massacre took place from December 13, 1937 to March 1, 1938. Japanese soldiers committed mass murders and forced Chinese and Korean women into sexual slavery during the occupation of Nanjing. But it was a more recent flare-up, say analysts, which brought the historic grievances back out into the open. Relations between China and Japan became strained in 2012 when Japan claimed islands in the East China Sea. China then declared in November 2013 an Air Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea, imposing air traffic restrictions over the disputed area. China's moves have made Japan and other nations in South East Asia nervous over it's expanding military and more assertive foreign policy, accusing China of trying to change the status quo. A right turn. In December, Abe further stoked tensions by visiting the Yasukuni Shrine where Japanese soldiers are honored -- including wartime leaders convicted as class-A war criminals. Abe became the first sitting prime minister to make the provocative visit since Junichiro Koizumi went in 2006. Six months later, Abe declared a more liberal interpretation of Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, essentially lifting a decades-long ban that prevented its military from fighting abroad. The following month, China released the Japanese wartime confessions online. Beijing also marked the anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War with an elaborate commemoration ceremony at Lugou Bridge, the site of the first showdown. \\"China is responding to Prime Minister Abe's attempts to rehabilitate the discredited wartime past. It's trying to underscore the fact that Japan suffers from selective amnesia,\\" says Jeff Kingston, an expert in Asian regional tensions and a professor at Temple University, Japan Campus. Global strategy. For long-time China watchers, this back-and-forth may be escalating at an alarming rate, but it is nothing new. \\"Since the early 1990s, the communist party has been trying to stoke anti-Japanese patriotism among the Chinese people mostly because they wanted to regain some of the legitimacy they lost in the Tiananmen Square massacre,\\" says Kingston, referring to the bloody military crackdown on Chinese student demonstrators in 1989. For China's president, the nationalism stoked by anti-Japanese sentiment, could become a powerful tool. \\"Nationalism is a very potent force in China right now. Xi is strengthening nationalistic sentiment to unify the country behind him and reinforce his own position as leader,\\" says Frank Ching, a political commentator. Beyond fomenting patriotism at home, China is also reminding its international partners that Japan hasn't come clean about its past. Kingston explains that Japan's imperialist history \\"is Abe's Achilles' heel.\\" By highlighting Abe's right-wing inclinations, China can drive a wedge between the U.S. and Japan, while pulling South Korea -- another nation that suffers wartime scars inflicted by Japan -- closer. China appears to be using it's propaganda push to isolate Japan from its allies. Resolution. But China's heavy-handed propaganda may backfire in the end because foreign governments may see it in a more cynical light. \\"If they press their case more quietly, it would be more effective,\\" says Kingston. It may also lead the nations further away from resolution. \\"These battles over history undermine trust and limit the room for diplomacy. It's very difficult for both sides to find a face-saving way to climb down,\\" says Kingston. Abe has repeatedly called for face-to-face talks with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping. \\"The door for dialogue is always open on my side, and I hope China has the same attitude,\\" the Japanese leader said. But analysts are not hopeful for talks, as both nations wait for the other to make the first move. \\"The Chinese side has made it clear that they will not talk to Abe unless he takes action to show that his attitude has changed, but I don't see Abe doing that in the absence of any commitment from China for a meeting first,\\" says Ching. All eyes are now on the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit coming up in November during which Abe has invited Xi to a meeting on the sidelines. The two leaders have never met since both came to power in 2012. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. Chinese state media has increased coverage on Japan's wartime atrocities amid deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations. 2. The Chinese State Archives Administration re-opened case files from a 1956 Chinese military tribunal, publishing summaries of convicted Japanese war criminals' confessions. 3.

Please answer the following question: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games.

It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

The film's narrative is structured as a before-during-after scenario: the first segment introduces the various characters and their stories, the second shows the nuclear disaster itself, and the third details the effects of the fallout on the characters. Dr. Russell Oakes (Jason Robards) lives in the upper-class Brookside neighborhood with his wife (Georgann Johnson) and works in a hospital in downtown Kansas City. He is scheduled to teach a hematology class at the University of Kansas (KU) hospital in nearby Lawrence, Kansas, and is en route when he hears an alarming Emergency Broadcast System alert on his car radio. He exits the crowded freeway and attempts to contact his wife but gives up due to the long line at a phone booth. Oakes attempts to return to his home via the K-10 freeway and is the only eastbound motorist. The nuclear attack begins, and Kansas City is gripped with panic as air raid sirens wail. Oakes' car is permanently disabled by the electromagnetic pulse from the first high altitude detonation, as are all motor vehicles and electricity. Oakes is about 30 miles (48Â km) away from downtown when the missiles hit. His family, many colleagues, and almost all of Kansas City's population are killed. He walks 10 miles (16Â km) to Lawrence, which has been severely damaged from the blasts, and, at the university hospital, treats the wounded with Dr. Sam Hachiya (Calvin Jung) and Nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams). Also at the university, science Professor Joe Huxley (John Lithgow) and students use a Geiger counter to monitor the level of nuclear fallout outside. They build a makeshift radio to maintain contact with Dr. Oakes at the hospital as well as to locate any other broadcasting survivors outside the city.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Abstract Over a decade ago, the Atacama humanoid skeleton (Ata) was discovered in the Atacama region of Chile. The Ata specimen carried a strange phenotype—6-in stature, fewer than expected ribs, elongated cranium, and accelerated bone age—leading to speculation that this was a preserved nonhuman primate, human fetus harboring genetic mutations, or even an extraterrestrial. We previously reported that it was human by DNA analysis with an estimated bone age of about 6–8 yr at the time of demise. To determine the possible genetic drivers of the observed morphology, DNA from the specimen was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform with an average 11.5× coverage of 101-bp, paired-end reads. In total, 3,356,569 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were found as compared to the human reference genome, 518,365 insertions and deletions (indels), and 1047 structural variations (SVs) were detected. Here, we present the detailed whole-genome analysis showing that Ata is a female of human origin, likely of Chilean descent, and its genome harbors mutations in genes (COL1A1, COL2A1, KMT2D, FLNB, ATR, TRIP11, PCNT) previously linked with diseases of small stature, rib anomalies, cranial malformations, premature joint fusion, and osteochondrodysplasia (also known as skeletal dysplasia). Together, these findings provide a molecular characterization of Ata's peculiar phenotype, which likely results from multiple known and novel putative gene mutations affecting bone development and ossification. ||||| When a bizarre six-inch skeleton was discovered buried in a leather pouch behind an abandoned church in the Atacama Desert of Chile in 2003, it baffled the world. The tiny figure had a cone-shaped head, the bones of a six-year-old and 10 pairs of ribs instead of the usual 12, leading to speculation that its origin could be extraterrestrial. But now, after detailed genetic analysis of the little mummy - nicknamed ‘Ata’ - scientists have concluded that its home planet is definitely Earth. Test carried out by experts at Stanford University and the University of California confirmed the skeleton is a human female baby, who suffered an array of genetic mutations and probably did not survive long after birth. Dr Garry Nolan, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, began the scientific exploration of Ata in 2012, when a friend called saying he might have found an ‘alien.’ “I had heard about this specimen through a friend of mine, there were some extraordinary claims put forward, and I managed to get a picture of it,” said Dr Nolan. “You can't look at this specimen and not think it's interesting. It's quite dramatic. So I told my friend, 'Look, whatever it is, if it's got DNA, I can do the analysis.\\" ||||| (CNN) A mummified skeleton discovered in Chile's Atacama Desert 15 years ago doesn't look like anyone you've ever met. In fact, some would say it looks, well, alien. It's a skeletal conundrum made up of perplexing features. It's only 6 inches tall -- but initial estimates of the age of the bones were consistent with a child aged 6 to 8 years. The long, angular skull, slanted eye sockets and fewer than normal ribs -- 10 pairs rather than the normal 12 -- only deepened the mystery. Questions surrounding the discovery led to speculation that it was a previously unidentified primate or even an extraterrestrial life form. The skeleton, dubbed Ata, was featured in TV shows and a documentary, \\"Sirius,\\" in which a UFO researcher attempts to figure out Ata's origins. Now, the authors of a study based on five years of genomic analysis want to set the record straight: Ata is human, albeit one with multiple bone disease-associated mutations. And they believe that their findings, published Thursday in the journal Genome Research , could help diagnose genetic mutation-based cases for living patients. Investigating Ata In 2003, Ata was found in a deserted mining town called La Noria, in Chile's Atacama region. It was thought to be ancient at first, but initial analysis conducted in 2012 proved that the skeleton was only about 40 years old. This meant DNA would still be intact and could be retrieved for study. The widespread speculation surrounding Ata brought the case to the attention of Gary Nolan, senior author of the new study and professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. \\"I learned about this through a friend who was interested in the entire area of extraterrestrial life,\\" Nolan wrote in an email. \\"He told me about a documentary coming out ('Sirius' ... you can find it on Netflix now) which was to feature the 'Atacama Humanoid.' It was claimed that this was possibly the mummy of an alien. \\"That was a significant claim in and of itself. More shocking though was the picture I was provided that was part of the online publicity. I decided to contact the movie directors (basically on a dare ...) to tell them it was possible to do a sequencing of the specimen (if it had earthly DNA ...) to determine its origin.\\" Nolan and his colleagues signed a confidentiality agreement, and the directors agreed to report Nolan's findings, even if the results indicated that Ata's DNA was human. Nolan wanted to study Ata for several reasons. The extraordinary specimen could have been a previously unrecognized primate species, some sort of human deformity or something else entirely. Nolan said he and his colleagues never believed it could be an alien. They wanted an answer to the basic question: \\"What is it?\\" DNA analysis would tell the true story. A sample extracted from the bone marrow of Ata's ribs was used to conduct a whole-genome sequence analysis. It was compared with human and primate genomes and determined to be a human female, probably a fetus, with Chilean ancestry. Although dating initially estimated the bone age of the skeleton at between 6 and 8 years, the researchers found that the remains had a rare bone-aging disorder that made them seem older than the person they belonged to. At first, 8% of the DNA didn't match with human DNA. Researchers determined that this was because of a degraded sample. An improved analysis matched up to 98%, Nolan said. Given the exposure and age of the skeleton, this wasn't surprising. Then, they moved on to diagnosing the abnormalities. It's all in the genes The researchers were looking for what might explain the skeleton's small stature, as well as the abnormal rib count and other bone and skull oddities. Dr. Atul Butte, another senior author of the study, was brought in to assist with evaluating the genome. Butte, the Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg distinguished professor and director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, treated the analysis as though it were for a patient. It revealed a number of mutations within seven genes. Together, these created bone and musculoskeletal deformities, like scoliosis, and skeletal dysplasia, known as dwarfism. \\"There are mutations in many genes, including genes involved with the production of collagen (in our bones and hair), joints, ribs, and arteries,\\" Butte wrote in an email. \\"We know these genes are involved with these processes in human development, but we are still learning what all the other genes in the DNA do.\\" Although the mutations found within the genes are known to cause bone disease, some of them had not been previously connected to growth or developmental disorders. The combination of genetic mutations explains Ata's appearance, but it's the number of mutations all present in the same specimen that surprised the scientists. \\"It's rare,\\" Butte said. \\"To our knowledge, no one has ever explained all of these symptoms in a patient before, and the changes in the DNA, or mutations, reflects this.\\" But what could have caused this number of mutations? Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \\"Many times, genetic diseases are passed on from parents that are carriers,\\" Butte said. \\"In this case, these mutations are so rare that we haven't actually ever seen some of these before, so it's hard to imagine there are carriers out there. We do speculate that the environment where this child was developing might have played a role. The specimen was found in a town with abandoned nitrate mines, and exposure to nitrates might have caused the mutations. But it's only speculation.\\" No other researchers have seen the remains. The way Nolan, Butte and their colleagues used their analytical tools to understand the mysteries presented by Ata's skeleton may provide a pathway for analysis of multiple genes to discover the roots of mutations. Butte said he hopes that the technology and tools used in this study can help patients and their families receive diagnoses quicker, as well as helping to develop treatments for conditions that can be traced to genetic mutations. \\"Many children's hospitals now see patients or children with unusual syndromes, including those never described before,\\" Butte said. \\"DNA sequencing is now more commonly used to help us solve these 'undiagnosed diseases.' But many times, we tend to search for a single gene mutation that might explain what we see in the patient. \\"What this case taught me we that sometimes there might actually be more than one major DNA difference involved in explaining a particularly hard-to-explain patient. We shouldn't stop a search when we've found the first relevant mutation; indeed there might be many others also involved.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The Atacama humanoid skeleton (nicknamed 'Ata'), discovered over a decade ago in Chile, sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life due to its unusual physical attributes including a 6-inch stature, fewer ribs than a standard human, an elongated cranium, and indicators of accelerated bone age. However, detailed genetic analysis performed by scientists from Stanford University and the University of California determined that Ata was a human female with mutations in several genes (COL1A1, COL2A1, KMT2D, FLNB, ATR, TRIP11, PCNT) related to disorders causing small stature, rib anomalies, cranial malformations, premature joint fusion and osteochondrodysplasia. These disorders gave the specimen its peculiar phenotype. The DNA sample used was extracted from Ata's bone marrow and through a whole-genome sequence analysis, it was found to be of likely Chilean descent. Further analysis also pointed to the presence of a rare bone-aging disorder and numerous genetic mutations not previously associated with growth or developmental disorders. The high number of mutations in Ata remains a mystery, but researchers speculate that the environment could have played a role — for instance, the abandoned nitrate mines where Ata was found may have caused the mutations.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","completion":"Storing the cupcakes at 0° F will result in slower decay compared to storing them at 10° F. Freezing food, including cupcakes, slows down the growth of microorganisms and enzyme activity, both of which contribute to spoilage. Lower temperatures further reduce these processes, extending the shelf life of the cupcakes. In general, the lower the temperature, the slower the decay. Since 0° F is lower than 10° F, storing the cupcakes at 0° F would cause them to decay slower, preserving their quality and freshness for a longer period. However, it is essential to ensure that the cupcakes are stored properly, either in airtight containers or wrapped securely to prevent freezer burn and flavor loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the contemporary era, we often find that acronyms play a significant role in a variety of facets in our lives. Be it in the fields of business, science, technology, or even casual conversation, acronyms have become an integral part of our communication process. They serve as convenient shorthand and can expedite the conveyance of information. The primary purpose of using acronyms is to simplify complex terms or phrases, making them easier to remember, and saving time and effort when discussing or writing about specific topics. Acronyms are also valuable in breaking down linguistic barriers, as they allow people from diverse linguistic backgrounds to communicate more effectively by using a common, abbreviated language. For instance, in the field of technology, acronyms such as \\"AI\\" (Artificial Intelligence), \\"IoT\\" (Internet of Things), and \\"CPU\\" (Central Processing Unit) save time and make it easier for people to stay updated on technological advancements. In business, acronyms like \\"B2B\\" (Business-to-Business) and \\"KPI\\" (Key Performance Indicator) help professionals discuss complex concepts with more clarity and speed. Moreover, acronyms can also contribute to a sense of camaraderie and shared understanding amongst individuals within specific communities or industries. People who work or participate in a particular domain can easily understand and use these acronyms, fostering a sense of belonging to a certain group. Furthermore, the use of acronyms can streamline discussions for people in fast-paced environments. For example, medical professionals often rely on acronyms to discuss diagnoses, treatments, and procedures more efficiently. Acronyms like \\"CPR\\" (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) and \\"EMR\\" (Electronic Medical Records) allow doctors and nurses to share vital information with one another quickly and effectively, which can ultimately save lives. However, it is also important to recognize that the excessive or inappropriate use of acronyms can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. When people from different disciplines or industries engage in conversation, it is crucial to ensure that the acronyms being used are clear and easily understood by all parties involved. In some cases, it might be necessary to provide explanations or context, particularly in cross-disciplinary interactions. In conclusion, the prevalence of acronyms in today's world signifies their undeniable role in facilitating effective communication across various domains. While the creation of new acronyms may seem commonplace, it is essential to acknowledge their significance in simplifying complex concepts, bridging linguistic gaps, fostering a sense of community, and streamlining interactions. As we continue to innovate and explore new avenues, it is likely that the use of acronyms will endure as a vital and indispensable component of modern communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood.

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

Question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Where was Manny driving?

Identify the reason for the appointment: First, Quinn needs to know the reason Kai needs an appointment with the doctor. Conversing with Kai, understanding the symptoms, and determining whether the condition is urgent or can wait until a more convenient time could be part of this step. 2. Gather relevant information: Quinn must have accurate and up-to-date information about Kai, including demographic details, insurance coverage, and medical history. This information is necessary for the doctor's office to create or update Kai's patient record and streamline the appointment process. 3. Determine a suitable day and time: In order to make an appointment that fits Kai's schedule, Quinn must be aware of Kai's availability and preferences. This involves talking to Kai about the days and times that are most suitable and discussing whether weekends or weekdays are preferable. 4. Research doctors and clinics: Quinn should spend some time researching doctors and clinics in the area to find the best fit for Kai's needs. This might involve looking at online reviews and checking doctors' credentials to ensure the chosen health care professional is well-suited for Kai's situation. 5. Call the doctor's office to schedule the appointment: Once Quinn has gathered all the necessary information and found an appropriate doctor, the next step is to call the doctor's office to schedule the appointment. Quinn must provide the details about Kai and the reason for the appointment, as well as the preferred date and time for the visit. If the desired time slot is not available, Quinn should be prepared to adjust and find an alternative that suits Kai's schedule. 6. Verify the appointment: After scheduling the appointment, it is important for Quinn to confirm the details, including the appointment date, time, and location, with both Kai and the doctor's office. This helps to avoid misunderstandings or errors that may cause scheduling issues later on. 7. Follow up with Kai: Lastly, Quinn should follow up with Kai to ensure they are aware of the appointment details and understand any preparations they must make, such as fasting before a blood test or bringing specific documents to the appointment. In conclusion, making a doctor's appointment for a friend like Kai involves several steps and thorough preparation, such as gathering relevant information, researching doctors and clinics, and scheduling and verifying the appointment. By following this process, Quinn can help ensure that Kai receives the necessary medical care in a timely and convenient manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Since I have always been interested in other cultures, I was happy to go along. While we were sitting at a table together, an older man came up and asked to buy me a drink. I told him “no thank you, I do not drink”. My arm was laying on top of the booth because I was sitting sideways since my big old pregnant belly would not fit under the table. He reached over and took my hand and said “ Come dance with me then”. I again told him I was not interested in dancing. He began to squeeze my hand and insisting I get up and dance with him. I kept telling him no, and pointing to my belly and saying I would not be dancing with anyone. He just kept squeezing my hand harder and trying to pull me out of the booth. I got angry when I felt something break in my hand and screamed at him “Get your effing hands off me!” The bar owner came over to see what the problem was. I explained that “this jerk just hurt my hand because I would not drink or dance with him!” The owner looked at me crying, and the man laughing, and kicked my friend and I out of the place!

Write an article based on this summary: Brazil's national truth commission says illegal arrests, torture, executions and forced disappearances were performed systematically by state agents under Brazil's military rule. Article:","completion":"Title: Brazil's National Truth Commission Uncovers Atrocities Committed During Military Rule Introduction Brazil's national truth commission has recently released a report on the systematic human rights abuses that took place during the country's military dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985. The findings reveal a horrifying history of illegal arrests, torture, executions, and forced disappearances, all performed systematically by state agents. The report not only sheds light on the actions of the Brazilian government during this period but also poses important questions about accountability and how Brazil can move forward in acknowledging and addressing this dark chapter in its history. Systematic Human Rights Abuses by State Agents According to the national truth commission's report, the abuses carried out by state agents were systematic and widespread during Brazil's military rule. The military regime, in its efforts to suppress dissent and maintain power, employed a wide range of tactics to instill fear and silence critics. State agents were responsible for numerous human rights violations, including illegal arrests of citizens without warrants or just cause, torture of political prisoners to extract information or confessions, and execution of those who were considered threats to the regime. Not only did state agents commit these crimes, but they also facilitated forced disappearances by hiding the bodies of victims, thereby making it difficult for families to find closure and justice. The commission's findings show that high-level officials were aware of these atrocities, and in some instances, directly ordered them, revealing a systemic level of complicity within the Brazilian government. Confronting Brazil's Past in the Pursuit of Justice and Healing The report from the national truth commission comes at an important time for Brazil, as the country grapples with its past and questions of accountability. The Brazilian government has yet to fully acknowledge the extent of human rights violations committed during the military dictatorship, and no one has been prosecuted or held accountable for these crimes. The amnesty law, enacted in 1979, has protected state agents from facing criminal charges, perpetuating a cycle of impunity. As the nation confronts its past, the Brazilian government must take steps to address these atrocities, promote justice, and facilitate healing for those affected by the military dictatorship. Initiatives can include overturning the amnesty law, establishing a mechanism for victims and their families to pursue restitution, and strengthening national institutions to prevent such occurrences in the future. Conclusion The report from Brazil's national truth commission is a stark reminder of the systematic human rights abuses committed by state agents during the country's military rule. The findings highlight the need for accountability, justice, and healing in order for Brazil to fully move forward from this dark period in its history. By addressing these injustices, Brazil can foster a national dialogue on human rights and democracy, ensuring that such atrocities never occur again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What was the name of the movie you saw last week? The major cause of your forgetfulness may be linked to what you store in your body, not in your short-term memory bank. Tests continue to show that people with enough Vitamin B-2 do well in memory exams. The \\"B\\" could stand for \\"brain\\", if you're one of many with limited instant recall. And the number one source of that vitamin is sunflower seeds. Even when you're sleeping or relaxing, your brain is still at work. Although it makes up just two percent of your total body weight, it uses up to 30 % of the calories you take in each day. For it to work properly, it must be fed. Even if you're not a breakfast eater, that meal is the best way to prepare your brain for the day. A quick and easy English _ with peanut and butter in it, a glass of milk, and an orange, might be what your brain may be asking you the first thing in the morning when you feel your head is in a fog. Having sunflower seeds and fruit between meals adds more muscle to that hungry, demanding organ. Vitamin B-1 also helps the memory, and that is found in eggs, meats and nuts. In Chinese culture, walnuts are known as the fruit for a long life because it is believed that they feed both the kidneys and the brain. And according to Chinese culture, if you keep those two important organs in good working order, you'll live longer.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing the arrangement for \\"Already Gone\\" from Beyoncé? Soon after composing \\"Halo\\", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), for which they wrote \\"Already Gone\\" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, \\"It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it.\\" Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.

For the third time in less than 24 hours, F-16 fighter jets were scrambled Thursday to escort a hapless pilot out of a restricted area in place for President Obama's visit to Los Angeles. Fighter jets intercepted a single-engine Cherokee Piper around 9:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) minutes after intercepting a Cessna for the same violation. Hours earlier, fighter jets intercepted a single-engine airplane northwest of Los Angeles for breaching a temporary airspace restriction, according to a military news release. The Federal Aviation Administration investigates all violations of restricted airspace, and FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer told CNN the agency is investigating the three cases over Los Angeles. Pilots refer to the area off limits to general aviation as a \\"temporary flight restriction\\" or TFR. The FAA keeps an up-to-date list of restricted airspace on its website, something pilots are supposed to check prior to departure. The penalties for violating restricted airspace can be severe according to the FAA. Pilots face possible suspension or loss of their pilot's license. Not all aircraft are equal when it comes to restricted air space. Commercial flights are in contact with the FAA during their flights and have a flight plan, so they're allowed to fly into and out of the cordoned-off area, according to the FAA. Police helicopters and air ambulance aircraft are also permitted in the no-fly zone. Flight restriction orders are usually put in place surrounding stadiums during large sporting events, scenes of natural disasters and areas around the president's movements. Currently there are 49 TFRs over airspace in the U.S. according to the FAA's website, including one restriction that's been in place since 2008 over Mt. Kilauea in Hawaii, an active volcano.

Information: - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - The South African Communist Party (SACP) is a communist party in South Africa. It was founded in 1921, was declared illegal in 1950, and participated in the struggle against apartheid. It is a partner of the Tripartite Alliance with the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and through this influences the South African government. - African Communist is the magazine of the South African Communist Party, published quarterly. The magazine was started by a group of Marxist-Leninists in 1959. It has its headquarters in Johannesburg. - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the largest of the countrys three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions, altogether organising 1.8 million workers. - The Tripartite Alliance is an alliance between the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). The ANC holds a majority in the South African parliament, while the SACP and COSATU have not contested any democratic election in South Africa. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Moses Mncane Mabhida ( 11 October 1923 -- 8 March 1986 ) was a South African politician . Mabhida was leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986 . - The African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing social democratic political party. It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa on the national level, beginning with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election, the first election after the end of apartheid. Today, the ANC remains the dominant political party in South Africa, winning every election since 1994. Its leader Jacob Zuma is the incumbent president of South Africa. - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.

A survey of 441 practices in Scotland found more than half have seen no investment in the last 10 years. The Scottish government has said its programme of investment in primary health care facilities is one of the largest of its kind. But BMA Scotland's Dr Alan McDevitt said: \\"We need investment that enables GPs to provide 21st century healthcare in 21st century buildings.\\" The key findings from the BMA survey indicate: Dr McDevitt added: \\"Not only is general practice bursting at the seams, but the buildings where we provide care for our patients are crumbling. \\"A number of health centres have been rebuilt in recent years, but the vast majority of GPs and their staff are struggling by in buildings that are not fit for purpose. \\"New ways of getting funding for GP premises are now urgently required. \\"In order to achieve the government's intention to shift care out of hospitals and into local communities, they need to build the capacity to enable general practice to provide this care.\\" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\"The Scottish government is investing Â£250m in community-based health facilities across Scotland through the hub programme, which represents one of the largest ever investments of its kind in the NHS estate. \\"During 2013, over Â£65m worth of new health and medical centres were completed and opened, including facilities in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\\" She added: \\"We will continue to work with a range of stakeholders, including the BMA, to ensure primary care services continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of the people of Scotland.\\" Perthshire GP Dr Claire Hutton said her building has consistently failed infection control inspections because of a lack of investment. She said: \\"The building is outdated and in need of repair and renovation. \\"There is limited practice space and we are unable to expand as there is no more room. \\"Our practice list is growing and this has placed increased pressure on rooms and staff. \\"Where we have flagged up the need for improvement measures on grounds of safety, for example for reception staff, we have been told there is no money available.\\"","completion":"The article discusses the lack of investment in primary health care facilities in Scotland, resulting in inability to provide adequate appointments for patients and deteriorating infrastructure of the health centers. A survey conducted on 441 practices in Scotland highlighted that over half of these practices had not seen any investment in the past decade. This has led to growing concern and critique from professionals such as Dr. Alan McDevitt from BMA Scotland, who emphasized the need for investment that enables GPs to deliver 21st-century healthcare in appropriate facilities. McDevitt further stated that many general practices are overcrowded, and the buildings are in crumbling condition. Despite some health centers being rebuilt, the majority are still operating in buildings unfit for purpose. He stressed the urgent need for new funding methods for GP premises to meet the government's intention of shifting care from hospitals to local communities. In response, a spokeswoman from the Scottish Government pointed out that the government had invested £250m in community-based health facilities across Scotland through the hub programme, marking one of the largest-ever investments in the NHS estate. She confirmed that during 2013, over £65m worth of new health and medical centers were completed and opened in cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen. The government also affirmed its commitment to continue working with stakeholders, including the BMA, to ensure the primary care services evolve to meet the changing needs of the Scottish people. Nevertheless, issues in local practices persist, as exemplified by Dr. Claire Hutton, a GP from Perthshire, whose building consistently failed infection control inspections due to limited investments. She outlined the building's dire need for repair, renovation and its inability to expand due to lack of space, which is increasingly pressurized as the practice's list of patients grows. Although they identified the need for improvement measures on grounds of safety, including for reception staff, they were informed that no funds are available to facilitate these changes. Thus, the issue of inadequate investment in primary healthcare facilities extends beyond the lack of appointments and deteriorating buildings, to broader challenges including patient safety and staff working conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English electronic music band formed in Wirral, Merseyside in 1978. Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \\"Electricity\\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song \\"Enola Gay\\". During 1988 the band appeared poised to consolidate their US success, with a support slot for Depeche Mode's Music for the Masses Tour at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on 18 June 1988, a top 20 US hit with \\"Dreaming\\" and a successful \\"Best of\\" album. However, it was at this point when OMD broke in two. Graham and Neil Weir left at the end of the 1988 US tour and co-founder Paul Humphreys subsequently called it a day, unhappy with the band's commercial orientation. Finally, Cooper and Holmes left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called The Listening Pool in 1989. This left only McCluskey to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the dance-pop Sugar Tax LP in May 1991, which charted at No. 3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (aka Lloyd Massett, Stuart Kershaw and Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of Sugar Tax: writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett. This iteration of the group was initially successful with hits like \\"Sailing on the Seven Seas\\" and \\"Pandora's Box\\", with lesser success on fellow chart entries, \\"Call My Name\\" and \\"Then You Turn Away\\". McCluskey's live band was then formed by Nigel Ipinson (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards) and Abe Juckes (drums) since late 1990. Kershaw, Ipinson and Coxon from 1992 to 1996 contributed to OMD albums and a 1993 tour. The fifth track from Liberator (1993), \\"Dream of Me\\", was built around a sample from \\"Love's Theme\\" by Love Unlimited Orchestra, a track which was written and produced by Barry White. To release the \\"Dream of Me\\" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual \\"Love's Theme\\" sample, but still be officially titled \\"Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)\\", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single \\"Everyday\\". Also in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the Esperanto album, a project by former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos (then working under the moniker of Elektric Music). McCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the 1996 album Universal, which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the Esperanto sessions, co-penned by Bartos. The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, \\"Walking on the Milky Way\\".

If There is strong evidence that readiness to change and confidence, especially before treatment, are unrelated., can we conclude that \\"There is no correlation between confidence and preparedness to change.\\"?","completion":"If there is strong evidence that readiness to change and confidence, particularly before treatment, are not related, it is important to analyze various aspects of this evidence and the context surrounding these two factors before concluding that \\"There is no correlation between confidence and preparedness to change.\\" While it may be tempting to draw a definitive conclusion from the available evidence, there are numerous considerations to take into account when evaluating the relationship between confidence and readiness to change. First, it's crucial to define and understand the terms \\"confidence\\" and \\"readiness to change.\\" Confidence refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a specific task or achieve a certain goal. In contrast, readiness to change refers to the individual's willingness to take necessary steps to modify their behavior or mindset to achieve a desired outcome. In the context of treatment, readiness to change often pertains to individuals' willingness to engage in therapeutic interventions and comply with treatment recommendations. Next, it is important to consider the nature of the evidence indicating no relationship between confidence and readiness to change. This evidence may come from various sources, such as research studies, observations of individuals undergoing treatment, or expert opinions in the field. When evaluating these sources of evidence, it is essential to examine the methodology, sample size, and other relevant factors that may impact the reliability and validity of the conclusions drawn. It is also crucial to consider the context in which the evidence is provided. The relationship between confidence and readiness to change may differ across various settings, populations, or treatment types. For example, the correlation may be different for people seeking treatment for substance abuse, mental health disorders, or chronic health conditions. Moreover, individual factors, such as personality traits, cultural background, or previous experiences, may influence the relationship between confidence and readiness to change. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the potential presence of confounding variables that may impact the relationship between confidence and readiness to change. Confounding variables are factors that are related to both variables under examination and may provide an alternative explanation for the observed association between them. If such variables are present but uncontrolled for, they may lead to false conclusions regarding the correlation between confidence and readiness to change. Lastly, it is necessary to take a closer look at the temporal aspect of the apparently unrelated nature of confidence and readiness to change. The evidence might be showing that confidence and readiness to change are not related before treatment, but this doesn't necessarily mean they are unrelated throughout the treatment process. As individuals progress through the treatment, their levels of confidence may change, potentially influencing their readiness to change. In conclusion, while strong evidence that readiness to change and confidence are not related before treatment may suggest a potential lack of correlation between the two factors, drawing definitive conclusions requires careful consideration of the various aspects mentioned above. It is important to critically analyze the evidence, assess the context and confounding variables, and explore potential changes in the relationship over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The Europe 2020 strategy aims to create a smart, sustainable, and inclusive European Union with high levels of employment, productivity, and social cohesion. In order to achieve these ambitious goals, it is essential that a comprehensive cohesion policy be integrated into the overall strategy. This policy should address and consider the various economic, social, and territorial aspects that play a crucial role in promoting growth, reducing disparities, and ensuring that all regions and populations have equal access to opportunities and resources. Economic aspects refer to elements such as competitiveness, innovation, capital investment, and entrepreneurship. These aspects are vital for creating new jobs, generating wealth, and improving the overall standard of living in the European Union. Incorporating economic aspects in the cohesion policy ensures a strong foundation for the efficient allocation of resources, as well as the promotion of policies and initiatives that bolster economic growth and productivity. Social aspects, on the other hand, involve factors such as education, healthcare, social inclusion, and income distribution. These elements are equally important in fostering a harmonious and inclusive society, where all individuals have access to essential services, can improve their skills, and can participate in the labor market effectively. By addressing social aspects within the cohesion policy, the Europe 2020 strategy aims to reduce poverty, mitigate social exclusion, and ensure equal opportunities for disadvantaged groups, including minorities, women, and people with disabilities. Territorial aspects pertain to the geographic characteristics and specific regional challenges that need to be acknowledged and addressed in order to create balanced and sustainable development across the European Union. This includes understanding and tackling issues related to urbanization, spatial planning, transportation, and accessibility to services. It also entails recognizing the unique strengths, resources, and opportunities present in various regions, as well as promoting cross-border cooperation and synergies between different areas. Integrating territorial aspects in the cohesion policy ensures that the particularities of each region are considered, leading to tailor-made interventions and development plans. In conclusion, it is essential that all three aspects - economic, social, and territorial - be woven into the fabric of the Europe 2020 strategy through a comprehensive cohesion policy.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great!

When saying \\"only lost 3,\\" it emphasizes that the person lost a relatively small number of games. The use of \\"also\\" in the second part of the sentence suggests that, in addition to losing 3 games, the person successfully saved 2 games. Sentence 2: \\"He also saved 3 and he only lost two games.\\" This sentence states that the person saved 3 games and lost only 2 games. Here, the emphasis is on \\"only lost two games,\\" which implies that losing 2 games was a minor issue compared to the 3 games that the person managed to save. The use of \\"also\\" in this sentence conveys the same meaning as in Sentence 1; it adds the fact that the person saved 3 games in addition to losing 2 games. To sum up, the information conveyed in the two sentences is different in terms of the number of games lost and saved. Sentence 1 states that the person lost 3 and saved 2 games, while Sentence 2 mentions that the person lost 2 and saved 3 games.

(Associated Press) Philip Chism, 14, was charged with murder Wednesday in the death of Colleen Ritzer, a 24-year-old math teacher at Danvers High School. Rania Rhaddaoui sat two seats away from Chism in Ritzer's Algebra I class, the final class of the school day. She said Chism was drawing in a notebook rather than taking notes Tuesday. \\"She came over and said, \`I didn't know you draw,' and he said, \`yes,' then later on, she said, \`Can you stay after with me?'\\" Rhaddaoui said. \\"Obviously, he stayed after because when I was leaving, he was still at his desk.\\" She said Ritzer had scheduled a test for Friday, but she was unsure why exactly Ritzer asked Chism to stay after school. Ritzer never returned home that day. Blood in a second-floor bathroom helped lead investigators to her body, which was dumped in the woods behind the school in a close-knit community about 20 miles north of Boston. Chism was picked up by police in the early morning hours Wednesday, walking along Route 1 in neighboring Topsfield. His attorney declined to comment outside court Wednesday and did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday. The high school remained closed for classes Thursday, but grief counselors were on hand to offer comfort to students. Kaitlyn Nash, 16, went to the school to be with her friends. She said students who knew and loved Ritzer were still trying to make sense of what happened. She said she found it particularly frightening that she had theater rehearsal Tuesday afternoon and was at the school when authorities believe Ritzer was killed. \\"It's just terrifying,\\" she said. \\"I know a lot of people don't want to go back to school at this point. I know we have to, and we just need to get on with.\\" Classes were expected to resume Friday. Authorities offered no clues Thursday on Chism's alleged motive. They also would not say how Ritzer was killed. Carrie Kimball-Monahan, a spokeswoman for Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, said the case was still being investigated. Chism had moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee before the start of the school year and was a top scorer on the school's junior varsity soccer team. Jean McCartin, a Danvers School Committee member, said the school has extensive programs to help ease the transition for new students who may have problems but there was no information about Chism that would have presented any red flags. \\"He just presented himself to us like any other student would,\\" she said Thursday. \\"And that's what I think is so hard for the administration right now. You know, their hearts are breaking because they just didn't know he was in need, if he was in need. ... No one knows why he would have behaved in this way and done such a terrible thing.\\" Students were also puzzled. Chism's teammates on the soccer team have said he was soft-spoken and nonviolent. Rhaddaoui said Chism was quiet, and she never saw him raise his hand in math class. She said they were also in the same history class, where he told classmates he spoke three languages: English, Portuguese and Japanese. Mark Nolan, of Clarksville, Tenn., who coached Chism in a local youth soccer program for several years when Chism was 9 or 10, said there was nothing unusual about him. \\"He didn't stand out; he wasn't a troublemaker,\\" Nolan said. \\"He had no problem with other kids. He wasn't overly aggressive.\\" Nolan recalled that Chism's father was in the military and his mother was a social worker. Both parents attended their son's soccer matches, Nolan said. Caio Silva, a Danvers High School senior and varsity soccer player, said he knew both Chism and Ritzer. He said he and his teammates are helping each other. \\"A lot of the guys are really shocked, a lot of guys are down, really upset,\\" he said. \\"It's just really sad,\\" he said. \\"A lady that was really sweet and a kid who was really sweet. It just doesn't really match up. It's really sad.\\" The manager of Hollywood Hits Theatres in Danvers said Chism went to the theater late Tuesday afternoon and bought a ticket to see Woody Allen's new movie, \\"Blue Jasmine.\\" Scott Przybycien said police came to the theater Tuesday night and said they had information that Chism had been at the theater. Przybycien said the theater's surveillance video showed Chism entering the theater at about 4:15 p.m., paying 8.00 in cash for a movie ticket, then leaving the building at about 6:15 p.m., after the movie ended. Authorities believe Ritzer was killed after school ended at about 2 p.m., but they have not released a specific time. \\"He didn't stand out in any way,\\" Przybycien said. \\"There was no reason for any business to be concerned. He looked like a normal, everyday customer coming in to watch a movie.\\" Ritzer was described as an enthusiastic, caring teacher who stood outside her classroom and said hello to all students, whether they were in her classes or not. \\"She was very approachable,\\" Rhaddaoui said. \\"She was always smiling. She always made the best of every situation.\\" Ritzer's family released a statement Thursday, asking the media to respect their privacy as they make arrangements \\"to celebrate Colleen's vibrant life.\\" Chism appeared briefly in court Wednesday for arraignment on a murder charge and was ordered held without bail. Ritzer was the second teacher allegedly killed by a student in the U.S. this week. A Sparks, Nev., middle school teacher was shot Monday, allegedly by a 12-year-old student. ___ Associated Press writers Denise Lavoie in Boston and Travis Loller in Clarksville, Tenn., contributed to this report. ||||| DANVERS — The high school math teacher who was allegedly slain by a 14-year-old student asked the student to stay after school on the day she was killed because she wanted to help him with an upcoming test, a student in the class said today. Student Rania Rhaedaoui said she was in Colleen Ritzer’s algebra class on the last period of the day on Tuesday, along with the suspect, Philip Chism. “She saw him drawing during class and she just said to him, ‘I didn’t know you could draw,’” said Rhaedaoui, a 14-year-old freshman. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below “I sit really close to him, so I could hear,” she said. Rhaedaoui said she later heard Ritzer ask Chism to stay after school. “She just said, ‘Can you stay after with me?’ He just gave a nod.” “There was a test coming up, and she wanted to know if he had any questions on learning equations,” Rhaedaoui said. Cambria Cloutier, another 14-year-old freshman, who was also in the class, said she walked by Ritzer’s classroom at about 3:15 p.m., more than an hour after the class had gotten out at 1:55 p.m. “She was standing at her computer, and he was just sitting there,” Cloutier said. “It just looked normal, like any other day.” Chism, who moved to Danvers this summer from Tennessee, was ordered held without bail Thursday in the death of Ritzer, 24, who was recalled as a natural teacher devoted to her students. Ritzer’s body was found early Wednesday morning in the woods behind the school. Few details of Chism’s alleged crime, including his possible motive, have been disclosed by investigators, and they declined comment today. Also today, a Danvers movie theater manager said Chism had watched a movie after school Tuesday at Hollywood Hits, a six-screen complex on Endicott Street. Scott Przybycien said Chism came into the building at 4:15 p.m. Chism paid 8 in cash for a ticket to the 4:30 p.m. showing of “Blue Jasmine,” a Woody Allen film. “He sat alone in Theater Two,” said Przybycien. Chism, who was caught on the theater’s surveillance video, was dressed in a sweatsuit, and did not purchase any concessions, Przybycien said. Chism did not say or do anything to draw attention to himself, Przybycien said. “There was nothing about his manner, or the way he was dressed, that stood out. A teen dressed in a sweatsuit is not unusual here,” he added. Chism left the theater about 6:15 p.m., the manager said. The school reopened today, offering grief counseling for students and families. Students arrived in shock and in tears. “There were people in the school, and no one, like, knew it was happening,” Amanda Finn, 18, said as she arrived. Finn said Ritzer was not one of her teachers, but she had a cheery presence. “She was so nice. She would see you in the hall and say, ‘Hey, great outfit!’” Finn said. Finn said she came to school to support the teachers. “I know so many of them were friends with her,” she said. Other schools in the town were to operate normally, according to a statement released Wednesday by School Superintendent Lisa Dana. The high school is expected to resume its normal schedule on Friday. Officials also scheduled an informational meeting for 6:30 p.m. in the school’s field house. Orange leaves littered the grass in front of the high school, under trees reduced to bare branches. A clutch of black balloons was tied to the blue-and-gold school sign out front. Pink ribbons — pink was said to be Ritzer’s favorite color — were tied to tree trunks. A memorial left over from a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds on Wednesday night included pink and white candles and handwritten condolence notes. One note said, “Another Angel Gone Too Soon.” Another said, “RIP Colleen Ritzer.” A Red Sox teddy bear lay next to a pot of yellow mums. Roses wrapped in cellophane, and other tokens, such as a small stuffed pink whale, were also included. The flag flew at half-staff and the electronic message board in front of the school displayed another tweet by Ritzer: “No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy.” June McEachern arrived at the school with her son, Kyle, a sophomore, for grief counseling. “As a parent, I don’t know how to console” a child through such a tragedy, she said. ”What can you say to a child?” She hopes the counseling provides guidance about how “to make the best of a bad, bad situation.” Nicole White, a freshman who had Ritzer for geometry, said Chism was in her biology and history classes. “He was just really quiet,” said White. She said Ritzer was “gentle and sweet . . . She wanted the best for everyone.” Sarah Roach, 14, another freshman who had Ritzer for geometry, said she hoped the counseling “will make us feel more comfortable going back to school” on Friday. “I’m kind of nervous about going back to [Ritzer’s] classroom,” Roach said. Roach said Ritzer had a fun, light-hearted approach to teaching geometry. “She’d say things like ‘Yay, more proofs today!’” Roach recalled. A spokeswoman for Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, whose office is overseeing the murder investigation, said prosecutors would not be commenting on the case, except through court filings. “This is an active and very fluid investigation, and it is inappropriate for me to make any comments about the possible findings of that investigation while it is ongoing,’’ said Carrie Kimball Monahan. She said that no additional charges had been filed against Chism – who faces a single count of first-degree murder – and no one else has been arrested. “I am not going to make any comments on any evidence that we have found,’’ she said in a brief telephone interview. Ritzer was reported missing at about 11:20 p.m. Tuesday when she did not return home and did not answer her cellphone. Police went to the high school, where they found blood in a second-floor bathroom, prompting a search of the grounds and the discovery of her body shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, authorities have said. Chism was last seen around 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the theater, police have said. Danvers police issued a tweet, seeking him as a missing child at 9:25 p.m. that night. Chism was found by police in neighboring Topsfield at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, walking north on the southbound side of Route 1. Chism was the leading scorer on the school’s junior varsity team. Several of Chism’s soccer teammates said he had mysteriously vanished Tuesday afternoon, missing a team practice at 4 p.m. and a team dinner at 6. Teammates last saw the youth running away from the practice field, breathlessly telling them he had something he needed to take care of. The students said Chism was an amiable, hard-working boy who loved soccer, and who had bonded quickly with his new team. Chism had moved in recent months from Tennessee to Danvers with his mother and sisters, friends said. His father has remained in Tennessee and has no contact with him, according to his teammates. The teenager had attended school in the Clarksville-Montgomery County school system in Tennessee since fourth grade, except for one year in Florida. He left in May, a school spokeswoman said. A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said the teacher was stabbed and cut. It appeared, according to the official, that a box cutter was used. The official declined to speak for attribution, citing the sensitivity of the investigation. In a police report filed in Salem District Court, where Chism was arraigned Wednesday as an adult on a charge of first-degree murder, investigators said the teenager “assaulted and subsequently murdered” Ritzer, then disposed of her body. A not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf. The law enforcement official said surveillance footage from inside the school showed Chism pushing a recycling bin through the hall and outside the building. Authorities are trying to determine if Ritzer’s body was in the bin. Evidence was found at multiple scenes at the school and the surrounding woods, police said. Police charged Chism after interviewing him and reviewing the footage. A statement released today by a spokesman for the Ritzer family said, “The Ritzer Family is most grateful for the outpouring of support during this very difficult time.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A 14-year-old student allegedly killed his high school math teacher after she asked him to stay late to help him with an upcoming test.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Any baking pan that has tough, baked on food in it can be cleaned without scrubbing by filling with warm water and placing an unused dryer sheet in the pan. Allow the pan to sit overnight. Remove the dryer sheet and dump the water in the morning and all of the baked on food will pour out with the water without any scrubbing needed. The method mentioned in option I is a more reasonable and effective approach to removing baked-on food from a cooking pan without scrubbing. The use of an unused dryer sheet, along with warm water, can help to soften and loosen the stubborn food particles through its surfactant content. These surfactants, also known as surface-active agents, make the water \\"wetter,\\" enabling it to penetrate and break down the baked-on deposits more efficiently. Allowing the pan to sit overnight is essential to give the warm water and dryer sheet enough time to work on the residue effectively. This process helps to weaken the bond between the food debris and the pan's surface, ultimately allowing you to remove the leftover food residue with ease in the morning. On the other hand, option II seems to have some errors and contains irrelevant terms, such as \\"dryer sheep\\" and \\"baked on towels.\\" Furthermore, it is a less coherent and less structured statement that doesn't provide a clear method for the cleaning process. In conclusion, option I is the better method for cleaning a baking pan with tough, baked-on food without scrubbing. This technique takes advantage of the surfactant properties of an unused dryer sheet to loosen the food residue and ease its removal.

Picking genders for characters could be the next big thing for emoji According to the common emoji keyboard, women don’t run. Only men run. See? 🏃 But that could soon change under a new draft proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the body that develops and maintains software standards for texts and characters. The document outlines a number of changes, including male, female and neutral gender options for many human-looking characters. If adopted, this would follow Apple’s move last year to unveil a new set of emoji that allows users to pick skin tones, which came after calls for racially diverse emoji. The new gender options would allow, for instance, a male, or female runner: And, the businessman who levitates? Now a businesswoman or businessperson can hover, for some reason. (Seriously, why is this person in a suit hovering?) From Emojipedia: Other changes would allow for customizing hair color to black, blond, brown, red and gray, as well as bald. According to the proposal, the list of hair options come from “the distinctions made in the U.S. Online Passport form, the UN Grounds Pass application, and other forms such as driver’s licenses.” The proposal also includes changing the direction of characters to face left or right and the possibility for some regional flags. Individual companies would still have to implement the changes, if adopted by Unicode, on their platforms. For instance, Google’s Android, which already has a set of gender-neutral emoji, doesn’t allow users to pick skin tones for emoji the way that Apple’s keyboard does. Given the large number of possible combinations, the proposals states that it’s “anticipated that only certain combinations would be supported by major vendors.” “There is no requirement or expectation that all of the possible combinations — or even any large subset of them — be supported by vendors, until there is technology in the fonts to deal with the combinatorics,” it states.

On the other hand, biologists investigate living organisms and their interactions with the surrounding environment. They study organisms on various scales, from the microscopic level (such as cells and molecules) to the macroscopic level (including ecosystems and global processes). Biologists often employ optical devices like microscopes, which magnify small samples to observe details otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Additionally, techniques like fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy provide them with detailed information about the structure, function, and behaviors of living organisms. In summary, both astronomers and biologists rely on optical devices to make new discoveries and better understand the subjects they study. These devices allow them to extend the limits of human vision, acquire crucial insights into their respective fields, and contribute to the ongoing development of scientific knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In other words, addressing Mrs. Allen by her first name does not lead to the presence of knives within educational institutions. Now, let's examine the hypothesis, \\"We wish to assure you that calling Mrs. Allen Jodie will not cause knives in the schools.\\" This statement essentially conveys the same information as the given premise, but the expression is slightly different. The hypothesis aims to provide reassurance that using the name \\"Jodie\\" for Mrs. Allen will not result in knives appearing in schools. The primary difference between the two statements is that the hypothesis emphasizes the intention to provide assurance and comfort regarding the lack of a causal link. Given that the premise is true, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is also true. Both statements assert in different ways that there is no causal relationship between using Mrs. Allen's first name and the presence of knives in schools. Consequently, the truth of the premise supports the truth of the hypothesis – both are effectively communicating that referring to Mrs. Allen as \\"Jodie\\" will not lead to knives appearing in educational institutions. In summary, if we accept the premise as true, it entails that the hypothesis is also true, since both the premise and hypothesis express, in different ways, the absence of a causal connection between calling Mrs. Allen \\"Jodie\\" and knives being present in schools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She also made several trips to rehab and appeared on the VH1 reality show \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\\" in 2010. The troubled star had been struggling following the sudden death of her boyfriend, 34-year-old David Wilson, on Jan. 13, 2013. Although she claimed she had nothing to do with Wilson's passing, McCready's two children Zander, 6, and her son with Wilson, Zayne, 9 months, were taken by authorities on Feb. 6 after family members claimed she was unfit to care for them. She decided to enter an in-patient facility for treatment. \\"Since boyfriend (David Wilson) shot himself she has been in bed for 3 wks,\\" her father said in court documents earlier this month. \\"Sleeps all day. Drinks all night and is taking Rx drugs. Not bathing or even helping take care of her 2 children.\\" But just a day after being ordered by a judge to enter a facility for a mental-health and alcohol-abuse evaluation, McCready was released to undergo outpatient treatment instead, according to E!

She was 37. Deputies from the Cleburne County Sheriff's Office were dispatched to a report of gunshots fired Sunday afternoon and found McCready's body on the front porch, the statement read. McCready leaves behind two boys, one of whom is 10 months old. The infant's father, record producer David Wilson, died of an apparent suicide last month. The singer struggled with addiction and mental illness, often publicly. She appeared in an episode of \\"Celebrity Rehab\\" three years ago with Dr. Drew Pinsky, who said he contacted her last month after her boyfriend's death. \\"When I heard she was struggling, I did reach out to her and urged her to go to take care of herself, get in a facility if she felt she needed,\\" said Pinsky, who hosts his own program on CNN's sister network HLN. \\"Her biggest fear was the stigma of doing so and what people would think if she, God forbid, took care of herself. And this to me is the most distressing part of this story. She is a lovely woman, we have lost her, and it didn't have to go down like this.\\" McCready burst onto the music scene in 1996 with her debut album \\"10,000 Angels,\\" and the chart-topping hit \\"Guys Do It All the Time.\\" In the past few years, McCready waged a public battle for custody of her elder son, Zander. She took the boy from her mother, who had custody, and fled with him to her home in Arkansas, saying she had concerns over his safety. A judge ordered authorities to pick up the boy, who was 5 at the time, and days later authorities found McCready hiding with Zander in a closet at her home. Country music stars expressed their condolences Sunday on hearing news of McCready's death. \\"I grew up listening to Mindy McCready ... so sad for her family tonight. Many prayers are going out to them,\\" tweeted singer Carrie Underwood. \\"It breaks my heart what addiction continues to take from this life,\\" singer Wynonna Judd wrote in a series of tweets. \\"Addiction is a disEASE & not a character flaw.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us. Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption. A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite. Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating. This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol. \\"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\\" Brunstrom says. \\"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\\" These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake. What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating. ...

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_RUN Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the specific actions and their corresponding command. Usage: For example, the action 'I_JUMP' would correspond to the command 'jump'. This is important because building a command from actions requires an understanding of which commands relate to which actions. Part #2: Incorporating directions into the command. Usage: If the action was 'I_TURN_LEFT', the command would be 'turn left'. This fits into the defined schema because 'left' denotes the direction of the action. Part #3: Using the term ‘opposite’ to signify the agent turning backward. Usage: An action sequence like 'I_TURN_RIGHT' followed by 'I_TURN_RIGHT' could be equated to the command 'turn left opposite'. This implementation works because turning right twice gets the agent to face in the opposite left direction. Part #4: Utilizing the word 'around' for making the agent execute an action while turning. Usage: If the sequence was 'I_TURN_RIGHT' and 'I_WALK', this could be represented as 'walk around right'. This is correct because 'around' is used when the agent needs to execute an action while turning. Part #5: Using ‘and’ to execute another command after the first command. Usage: For example, if the actions were 'I_JUMP' and 'I_WALK', then the command would be 'jump and walk'. This meets the criteria since 'and' is used to conjoin two actions together. Part #6: Using 'after' to execute a command following another command. Usage: If the action order was 'I_WALK' then 'I_JUMP', the command may be 'jump after walk'. This is correct because 'after' shows that the jump is to take place following the walk. Part #7: Implementing the words 'twice' and 'thrice' to trigger the repetition of commands. Usage: For example, if the actions were 'I_WALK', 'I_WALK', and 'I_WALK', the command would be 'walk thrice'. This fits the definition as 'thrice' is used to denote the command 'walk' should be executed three times."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ Nigel Farage would have burst a blood vessel, had he only had the chance to listen in. What could be more metropolitan liberal elite than last week’s Guardian Christmas telethon, as readers called in to journalists to make a donation for child refugees? Just imagine it, all those Islington luvvies and bleeding hearts, ringing in from one part of London N1 to another, the Bollinger chilling nicely in the fridge, as they salved their well-paid consciences and congratulated themselves on being leftier than thou. How utterly Guardianista. Except it was nothing like that. The calls came from all over the country, with perhaps an over-representation from the north of England. In my two and a half hours on the phones, I heard from Barrow-in-Furness, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Swansea and a string of small towns and villages from Devon to Cumbria. Colleagues reported the same pattern. True, I took a call from my own small part of north London – but it was the only one. However else you’d want to describe this group of people, metropolitan they weren’t. Nor were they the elite. Pensioners called to give the fiver or tenner they worked out they could spare, or, as Polly Toynbee has recounted, their entire winter fuel allowance. Gary Younge took a call from an unemployed Asian man, living with his parents in northern England, who gave £1.33: he chose that precise sum because he had £1.34 in his account. Meanwhile, and by coincidence, Stuart Heritage spoke again to Sam, the same teenager whose call he took last year. Sam isn’t old enough to have a credit card, but each year he has raised money at his school for the Guardian appeal. Not many of these people fit the Guardianista stereotype. I wonder what Farage and his friends would make of the lifelong reader who described the recent funeral of a 94-year-old friend: a retired major and veteran of the second world war whose devotion to the Guardian was so great that a copy of the paper was placed on top of his coffin. And yet, because of their sympathy for refugees and their presumed support for British membership of the EU – with 91% in favour, Guardian readers were the country’s most solidly pro-remain demographic, more reliably anti-Brexit than Green party voters, the young, university graduates and Scots – these people would be casually, and falsely, dismissed by the likes of Farage as the metropolitan liberal elite. Indeed, in a year brimming with dishonesties, this phrase represents one of the great myths of 2016. In August, serving as warm-up man at a Mississippi rally for Donald Trump, the then Ukip leader hailed the Brexit result as a victory for what he called the “little people, the real people ... the ordinary, decent people”. The implication was that those who had voted remain were unreal and indecent, that they were the big people, the representatives of the mighty and powerful. Theresa May played the same trick in her party conference speech in the autumn, casting the opponents of Brexit (forgetting, of course, that during the referendum campaign she was one) as members of an exclusive, global club, denizens of Davos comfortable in the first-class lounge and utterly devoid of national allegiance – people who were, in her memorable phrase, citizens of the world and therefore citizens of nowhere. As I wrote then, she sought to rebrand the 48% as the 1%. But it’s an absurd lie. Of course, more Britons voted to leave the EU than to stay, but nearly half of those voting chose remain. That is not a tiny metropolitan elite. In the US, 2.9 million more people chose Hillary Clinton than chose Donald Trump. That too is not an elite. In most democratic systems, such a margin would have been hailed as a victory and a mandate; only under the arcane rules of the electoral college could such a result have brought defeat. So enough of this fraudulent talk of elites, metropolitan or otherwise. But what of that middle word, the meat in this rhetorical sandwich? What of “liberal”? After this year, especially, I think the word should be worn with pride. If liberal means wanting to help children fleeing a dictator’s barrel-bombs, then call me a liberal. If liberal means believing that the peoples of a continent that for centuries was torn apart by war and bloodshed have found a new, peaceful mechanism for resolving their differences, and that Britain should play its part in that, then call me a liberal. If liberal means holding true to the values of the Enlightenment, including a belief in facts and evidence and reason, then call me a liberal. And if liberal means cherishing the norms and institutions that protect and sustain democracy, from a free press to an independent judiciary, then call me a liberal. For those values are under assault just now, in a way few of us ever imagined. So when it comes to “liberal”, we have nothing to apologise for. Sure, the remainers’ most public faces could fairly be described as both “metropolitan” and “elite” – columnists for London-based newspapers among them. But the same is self-evidently true of the other side, too. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are not exactly members of the lumpen proletariat, are they? There is no definition of elite or metropolitan that does not include those two. And the same is true of that other dread phrase of 2016, “the bubble”. As if the only people who live in a bubble are liberal, anti-Trump, anti-Brexit types, while their opponents are rooted in the earthiness of the real world. What garbage. Stockbroker Farage paid homage to billionaire Trump in the latter’s gold elevator; that’s the same Farage who confessed his relief that vacating the Ukip leadership meant he no longer had to deal with “low-grade people” and who said his £85,000 MEP’s salary, excluding abundant expenses, meant he was “poor”. Those who truly live in a bubble are those who cannot begin to imagine the lives of – still less empathise with – those outside their own first-world realm of safety, comfort and prosperity. When Tory MP and Dorset landowner Richard Drax objects to an overseas aid budget of 0.7% of national income, insisting “charity begins at home” – as if 99.3% of our “charity” isn’t already being spent at home – then it’s he who’s living in a bubble. But in this season of goodwill, let’s not play their game – competing over which side is less detached, less metropolitan or less elite. Instead, let’s think of those people who were so moved by the plight of their fellow human beings they gave what they had, even when they could barely spare it. Call them names if you like, but they are the very best of us.

That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert.

Article: The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\" Question: Many reviewers consider the second part of the book to be about what issue?","completion":"Many reviewers consider the second part of the book, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" to be primarily concerned with the issue of race relations. This perspective stems from the deep exploration of the \\"spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\" as described by book reviewer Harding LeMay. The novel delves into the racial tensions and prejudices faced by African Americans in the South during the 1930s and highlights the moral and social implications of these biases. The novel's focus on race relations is also believed to have been shaped by two significant events involving racial issues in Alabama during the 1950s. The first event was Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. The second event was the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted as the first African American students. Both events serve as a backdrop to the novel's construction, set amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Overall, the second part of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" tackles the complex issue of race relations in the South, reflecting the conflicts, tensions, and fears experienced by both white and African American individuals during that time. It presents a vivid picture of the stark racial divide, drawing attention to the importance of addressing these prejudices and striving for social and moral change."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Would car A emit less or more carbon monoxide than car B? Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. Answer:","completion":"Car A would emit less carbon monoxide than car B. The reason for this difference in emissions is due to the presence of a catalytic converter in car A. Catalytic converters are designed specifically to reduce the harmful emissions produced by a vehicle's internal combustion engine. Unburned hydrocarbons in car engines can be more easily converted to carbon dioxide and water when a catalytic converter is present. They enable this conversion by increasing the rate of specific important reactions using catalysts, which are substances that help speed up the chemical processes without being consumed or changed by the reaction themselves. In addition to assisting with the conversion of unburned hydrocarbons, catalytic converters also play a key role in reducing carbon monoxide emissions. Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fuel. Catalytic converters ensure that carbon monoxide is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, which is less harmful to human health and the environment. Furthermore, catalytic converters help decrease the amount of nitrous oxide compounds emitted from cars. Nitrous oxide compounds are harmful pollutants that contribute to smog and acid rain. In the presence of a catalytic converter, these compounds are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases, reducing the adverse environmental impacts of a car's exhaust. Given this information, it can be concluded that car A, with a catalytic converter, would emit significantly less carbon monoxide compared to car B, which lacks one. This difference makes car A more environmentally friendly and better choice for John if he values lower emissions and a cleaner atmosphere along with the newer features of the car. However, John's preference for the design of car B is also important to consider, and he must weigh the pros and cons of each vehicle before making his final decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. Which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Tree city experienced less convection within the Earth, causing the plates to move. While both cities are located on plate boundaries and close to volcanoes, Tree city seems to have fewer and less frequent earthquakes compared to Red city. This implies that there are lower stress levels and less energy release happening in Tree city's geological surroundings, which can be linked to less convection in the Earth's mantle that drives plate movement. Since convection is responsible for plate movements, tectonic activity, and resultant earthquakes, we can conclude that Tree city has less convection within the Earth compared to Red city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) races traditionally commence in late May or early June each year. The exact dates can vary depending on the specific scheduling for a given year, but the event typically spans a two-week period with a week of practice sessions followed by a week of intense, high-speed racing. The Isle of Man TT is a world-renowned motorcycle road racing event that has been held on the Isle of Man, a self-governing British Crown Dependency located between England and Ireland, since 1907. The races take place on public roads that are temporarily closed for the event, and the course covers a distance of approximately 37.73 miles (60.72 kilometers) around the island. The event is divided into several classes, with various types of motorcycles ranging from Superbikes and Supersport machines to Sidecars and Zero emissions electric motorbikes, all competing for the prestigious TT races titles. The most legendary race is the Senior TT, widely considered the blue riband race and the one riders often aim to win the most. The races attract competitors and spectators from all over the world, contributing significantly to the Isle of Man's tourism industry. The TT races are not only a test of skill and endurance for the riders but also a remarkable showcase of cutting-edge motorcycle technology, as manufacturers often develop and refine their machines specifically for the unique demands of this race. The Isle of Man TT is known for its dangerous nature and challenging course layout, with high speeds, sharp bends, and limited run-off areas, making it one of the most challenging and demanding races in the world of motorsport. Over the years, there have been numerous fatalities and serious injuries, both among competitors and spectators, which has raised concerns regarding the event's safety. Throughout the two weeks of the Isle of Man TT, there are various activities and entertainment for fans and visitors to enjoy, including motorcycle displays, live music, and gatherings in the TT paddock area, where people can get up close and personal with the riders and their teams.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

A major shake-up of care in the city is taking place as part of a move to the new South Glasgow University Hospital. Doctors at the Beatson cancer centre claim the changes will leave inadequate staffing in the event of emergencies. They have written to Health Secretary Shona Robison to say the situation is \\"desperate\\" and called for action. The doctors claim the reconfiguration of hospital services in the city will see the removal of acute medical support services from the site by the end of next week. The signatories of a letter have called for urgent action amid fears that junior doctors will be left in charge out of hours and that there would be inadequate staffing for resuscitating patients at such times. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it would \\"never put the safety of patients at risk\\". The health secretary said the views of clinicians, including those at the Beatson, \\"need to be fully addressed\\". The letter from senior medical staff, which has also been sent to the General Medical Council, said they \\"cannot continue to admit patients\\" unless changes due to take place next week are stopped. The new super hospital on the south side of Glasgow, which cost Â£842m to build, replaces four ageing hospitals across the city. The consultants have claimed that, three miles away in the Beatson, only junior doctors will be left on site out of hours. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it recognised the consultants' concerns. The health board said temporary arrangements were in place and long-term plans were still being finalised. It said: \\"Plans are also in place to include critical care training for oncology nursing staff. \\"In the interim period we will also provide resident overnight anaesthetic cover to the unit and will identify a named anaesthetic contact for daytime patient management issues.\\" Responding to the letter, Health Secretary Ms Robison said: \\"It is vital that the health board addresses the issues raised so that the move can go ahead with the support of the clinicians. \\"I have spoken to the chairman of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and had assurance this will happen.\\" Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, told BBC Radio's Good morning Scotland programme she had received assurances from the medical director of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde board about patient safety.

Answer:","completion":"Gracie Mansion has been the official residence of the Mayor of New York City since 1942. It is named after Archibald Gracie, a prosperous Scottish merchant who had the mansion built in 1799. While it has housed many mayors over the years, not all have chosen to live there. The mansion is located in the Mayor's Park in the East End area of Yorkville, Manhattan, overlooking the East River. One famous resident of Gracie Mansion was Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who was the first mayor to live there starting in 1942. Other notable residents included mayors Robert F. Wagner Jr., John Lindsay, and Ed Koch, who all chose to live in the mansion during their terms. Mayor Michael Bloomberg chose not to live in the mansion during his time in office, instead remaining in his own private home. Bloomberg did, however, use Gracie Mansion for official city events. Among those who lived there, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family moved into Gracie Mansion in July 2014. de Blasio was the first mayor to live in the residence since Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who lived there from 1994 until his term ended in 2001. Prior to Giuliani, Mayor David Dinkins also resided in the mansion. Gracie Mansion is not only a home for the mayor; it serves as a functional space used for official city business, including receptions, dinners, and other events. It is also a historic site – a museum of sorts – exhibiting art and furnishings, many from the Federalist period, in the public spaces. The conservancy provides guided tours, sharing the history and significance of the mansion. It is important to note that the residing mayor's presence at Gracie Mansion doesn't interfere with these official activities or public accessibility to historic spaces. The private residential section of the mansion, occupied by the mayor's family, is separate from the public areas of the house, ensuring privacy for the residents and uninterrupted operation of city events and tours. To summarize, the residents of Gracie Mansion are typically the incumbent mayors of New York City and their families. However, this can vary as each mayor has the liberty to choose to reside at the mansion or maintain a private residence elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - The Pulitzer Prize for Music is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It was first awarded in 1943. Joseph Pulitzer did not call for such a prize in his will, but had arranged for a music scholarship to be awarded each year. This was eventually converted into a full-fledged prize: \\"For a distinguished musical composition of significant dimension by an American that has had its first performance in the United States during the year.\\" Because of the requirement that the composition had its world premiere during the year of its award, the winning work had rarely been recorded and sometimes had received only one performance. In 2004 the terms were modified to read: \\"For a distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance or recording in the United States during the year.\\" - The Doctor of Musical Arts degree (D.M.A.) is a doctoral academic degree in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually music performance, music composition, conducting, or music education) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the masters and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers. As a terminal degree, the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in musicology or music theory typically enter a Ph.D. program, rather than a D.M.A. program. Terminology. The degree is also abbreviated as DMA (without periods), D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D.. For the related degree Doctor of Music, the abbreviation is D.M. or D.Mus. For the related degree Doctor of Arts, the abbreviation D.A. is used. - St. Olaf College is a coeducational, residential, four-year, private liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota, United States. It was founded in 1874 by a group of Norwegian-American immigrant pastors and farmers, led by Pastor Bernt Julius Muus. The college is named after the King and the Patron Saint Olaf II of Norway and is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - The Purple Heart is a United States military decoration awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U.S. military. With its forerunner, the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth, the Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U.S. military members the only earlier award being the obsolete Fidelity Medallion. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York. - Carleton College is a private liberal arts college in the historic town of Northfield, Minnesota. The college enrolled 2,014 undergraduate students and employed 245 instructional faculty members in fall 2015. Carleton is one of few liberal arts colleges that runs on the trimester system. - Archibald MacLeish (May 7, 1892 April 20, 1982) was an American poet and writer who was associated with the Modernist school of poetry. MacLeish studied English at Yale University and law at Harvard University. He enlisted in and saw action during World War One, and lived in Paris in the 1920s. On returning to the US, he contributed to Henry Luce's magazine \\"Fortune\\" from 1929 to 1938. For five years MacLeish was Librarian of Congress, a post he accepted at the urging of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. From 1949 to 1962, MacLeish was Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University. MacLeish was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes for his work. - The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is a mainline Protestant denomination headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The ELCA officially came into existence on January 1, 1988, by the merging of three Lutheran church bodies. , it has approximately 3.7 million baptized members in just over 9,300 congregations. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 2.1% of the U.S population self-identifies with the ELCA and mainline Lutheranism. It is the seventh-largest religious body and the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. The next two largest Lutheran denominations are the Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod (LCMS) (with approximately 2.1 million members) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) (with approximately 370,000 members). There are also many in the United States, some of which came into being composed of dissidents following the major 1988 merger. The ELCA belongs to the World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation. The ELCA is in full communion with the Episcopal Church, Moravian Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church. - Bernt Julius Muus (March 15, 1832 May 25, 1900) was a Norwegian-American Lutheran minister and church leader.

Like other doctorates, the D.A. is an academic degree of the highest level. The D.A. is also frequently conferred as an honorary degree with the added designation of honoris causa. - Leslie Bassett (January 22, 1923 February 4, 2016) was an American composer of classical music, and the University of Michigan's Albert A. Stanley Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Composition. Bassett received the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his \\"Variations for Orchestra\\". - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist).

Question: The answer to the question: What's the first name of the person whose infatuation compromises the Sox performance? is inside the article: Wives and girlfriends sit together at a Sox game to watch Wacky Waters pitch. He's a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at today's game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy 300 worth. In the grandstand, catcher Hippo Jones's wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what he's doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly can't throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money. Sure enough, Wacky's infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married. While they are happy for the couple, Hazel schemes to have a Hollywood producer require Pepita's presence to shoot a movie there. This could keep Wacky focused on baseball until the World Series. Pepita finishes the film faster than expected. She hurries to Kansas City to see Wacky and the Sox, so the wives take matters into their own hands, tying up Pepita in a hotel room against her will.

But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: To whom are cases or accusations deferred when no additional evidence is admissible to the elders? Context: Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.

Pick the answer from these options Choices: *fall. *spring. *summer. *winter.","completion":"A rabbit's fur would be thickest during the winter season. Rabbits, like many other animals, have developed various physiological adaptations to cope with and survive colder climates. One of these adaptations is having thicker fur during winters, which play a crucial role in providing insulation and keeping the rabbits warm in the cold season. As the temperatures start dropping in the fall, rabbits start to grow their winter coat. This fur is thicker and provides more insulation than their summer coat. The winter coat plays an essential role in helping rabbits maintain a stable body temperature, as it traps a layer of air near the skin which works as an insulating barrier against the cold. It also helps to keep out moisture, protecting rabbits from dampness and decreasing their chances of catching cold associated diseases. By having a thick coat in the winter, rabbits can preserve vital body heat, and prevent excessive heat loss through the skin surface, allowing them to stay active and search for food during the chilly months. This is essential for their survival as they need to have access to enough food to meet their energy requirements and stay healthy. As temperatures rise again in the spring, rabbits start to shed the thick winter coat and transition to a lighter summer coat. Spring and summer are generally warmer seasons, and the need for insulation is reduced; hence, shedding their winter coat allows rabbits to maintain a comfortable body temperature. In summary, the season during which a rabbit's fur would be thickest is winter. This seasonal adaptation helps the rabbits to insulate themselves from low temperatures, keep out moisture, maintain a stable body temperature, and ultimately, increase their chances of survival in harsh conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Instead of finding Daniel, Laura finds his son Danny (Fox) of whom Uncle Joe had always been especially fond when he was a little boy. Professional bowler Danny left the family with his father, but he accepts the cousins' invitation to return â after rolling a gutter ball in a big tournament and finding out that he has a pre-arthritic condition developing in his wrist.

Q: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, answer the following question.

This will secure the hose to the pump. If the lower radiator hose is still removed or if you removed the upper hose for any reason, put them back on the radiator now. Once the hose has been slid onto the radiator, use a pair of pliers to move the clamps up the hose to the place where the hose and the radiator meet. This will fasten the hose to the radiator. If your coolant looks dirty or if it has been more than a year since you last changed the coolant in your vehicle, use new coolant. Dilute the coolant as specified in your owner’s manual or service guide and fill to the mark that says “cool” or “cold” on the tank. If your coolant is clean and relatively new, you can pour the old coolant back into your radiator. You should use the routing diagram stamped on your hood or printed in your owner’s manual to make sure that the belt is run properly. Pulleys with grooves are intended to meet the grooved side of the belt, but some flat pulleys are meant to be driven by the flat backside of the belt. This can be done by releasing the tensioner in a serpentine design. If you are working with a V-belt design then you will need to tension the belt manually. A good rule of thumb is that the belt should have a maximum of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of movement in the middle of the belt's longest run. Check your vehicle manual for more information. If in doubt, consult a mechanic. You do not want to start your engine without all of the appropriate accessories hooked up. Take a second look over everything and make sure that all is well before moving on.

Hoping to rebound from their overtime loss to the Patriots, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. The Broncos and Chiefs entered the game tied for the AFC West division lead, both with 9-2 records. The Chiefs grabbed the lead late in the first quarter, with quarterback Alex Smith throwing a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Junior Hemingway. The Broncos responded at the beginning of the second quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker. However, Chiefs' running back Knile Davis returned the ensuing kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown, and following a Manning interception on the Broncos' next possession, Smith connected with tight end Anthony Fasano on a 12-yard touchdown pass to give the Chiefs a 21-7 lead. The Broncos then reeled off 28 unanswered points, beginning with a 3-yard touchdown pass from Manning to running back Knowshon Moreno. Manning then connected with Decker on three more touchdown passes &#8212; a 37-yarder and a 15-yarder in the third quarter, followed by a 1-yarder early in the fourth quarter. A 1-yard touchdown run by Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles narrowed the Broncos' lead to 35-28 with 6:32 remaining in the fourth quarter, and the Chiefs' defense forced a punt on the Broncos' next possession. The Chiefs' offense had one last possession with 3:32 remaining in the fourth quarter, and Smith drove the Chiefs to as far as the Broncos' 13-yard line with 1:51 remaining.

Process: - Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant traps light from the sun - The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil - This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf - Carbon dioxide enters the leaf - Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together - This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats - Oxygen goes out of the leaf through the stomata - Question: suppose I recycle my air before it goes outside happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"Recycling air before it goes outside can influence the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) available for plants, which in turn can impact the process of photosynthesis, and thus affect sugar and oxygen production. In the context of your question, if recycling the air leads to a decrease in the CO2 concentration in the surrounding environment (e.g., if CO2 is being removed or used up in the recycling process), it would result in less sugar and oxygen being produced by the plants. This is because: 1. As CO2 concentration decreases, the rate of photosynthesis is slowed down. Photosynthesis is a light-dependent process triggered by the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll molecules in the chloroplasts. However, it also relies on the availability of CO2, as it is a key reactant along with water (H2O) and sunlight to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). 2. With less CO2 available, there will be fewer reactions of carbon dioxide combining with water to produce glucose, leading to less sugar being generated for the plants to utilize or store. 3. At the same time, the reduction of CO2 also implies fewer oxygen molecules are being produced during the photosynthesis process. This is because oxygen is a byproduct of the light-dependent reaction occurring in the chloroplasts. Thus, recycling the air before it goes outside, if it results in lower CO2 levels, could lead to a decrease in sugar and oxygen production by the plants. However, if your air recycling process maintains or enriches the CO2 levels in the environment, it might not have any negative impact on plant photosynthesis and might even enhance the process. In this case, there would be no effect or a possible positive impact on sugar and oxygen production, given that other factors such as sunlight and water are also available in sufficient amounts to support photosynthesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bernie Sanders dismisses controversy over rapper’s comments at rally as ‘gotcha politics’ Rapper Killer Mike caused controversy at a Bernie Sanders rally in Atlanta Feb. 16, saying \\"a uterus doesn't qualify you to be president of the United States.\\" (Instagram/orangechaglad) ATLANTA — A spokesman for Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Wednesday dismissed as \\"gotcha politics\\" a controversy over comments by rapper Killer Mike, a frequent Sanders surrogate, about whether a uterus alone qualifies someone to be president. Killer Mike, whose real name is Michael Render, was among several African-American supporters who spoke ahead of the Vermont senator at a raucous rally here at the campus of Morehouse College, a historically black institution. During his remarks, Killer Mike relayed a recent conversation with an activist named Jane Elliott, who, he said, told him: \\"A uterus doesn't qualify you to be president of the United States. You have to have policy that's reflective of social justice.\\" [Clinton looks to sisterhood, but votes may go to Sanders] The comment ignited a debate on social media, with some accusing the rapper of being sexist –something he strongly denied through a series of posts on Twitter. Sanders weighed in on Wednesday morning, with a spokesman saying he \\"doesn't believe gender should be a reason to vote for or against someone.\\" \\"That's the point Mike was making when he quoted Jane Elliott, the internationally known educator,\\" said Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs. \\"We need to get beyond the gotcha politics and get to the issues at the heart of the election.\\" [Clinton, feminists and the politics of voting for ‘the old white guy’] In a race featuring Hillary Clinton, who would be the country's first female president, gender has been an undercurrent, with several previous controversies emerging. Killer Mike said on Twitter Tuesday night said that he was only repeating something he had been told and that he was supportive of other women politicians besides Clinton, including Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who also spoke on Sanders's behalf at the rally. \\"I don't and never will Hate or think less of women,\\" Killer Mike said in a tweet. \\"Sen.

Karl Moore described the first Eblaite kingdom as the first recorded world power . Starting as a small settlement in the early Bronze Age ( c. 3500 BC ) , Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria . Its language , Eblaite , is now considered the earliest attested Semitic language after Akkadian . Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC ; it was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur . The second Ebla was a continuation of the first , ruled by a new royal dynasty . It was destroyed at the end of the third millennium BC , which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city , forming the third Ebla . The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center ; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad ( modern - day Aleppo ) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC. Ebla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network . Artifacts from Sumer , Cyprus , Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city 's palaces . The political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model . Women enjoyed a special status and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs .

It is situated in northwestern Syria, bordering Turkey. Reports of its area vary, depending on the source, from 5,933 km² to 6,097 km². The Governorate has a population of 1,464,000 (2010 estimate). The capital is Idlib. - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west. - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - The Eastern Mediterranean denotes the countries geographically to the east of the Mediterranean Sea (Levantine Seabasin). This is commonly interpreted in two ways: - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 . - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - Mardikh is a village in the Idlib Governorate of Syria. It is the nearest village to the site of historical Ebla (\\"Tel Mardikh\\"), south east of Idlib. Nearby localities include Saraqib to the north, Kafr Amim to the east, Maardabsah and Khan al-Sabl to the south and Dadikh to the west. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Mardikh had a population of 2,918 in the 2004 census. - The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards. - Beth Nahrain or Bet Nahrain or (\\"house (of the) rivers\\") is the Assyrian name for the region known as Mesopotamia in the Syriac language (Greek \\"land between the rivers\\") as well as its surrounding periphery. Geographically, it refers to the areas around the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (as well as their tributaries). The Aramaic name loosely describes the area of the rivers, not between the rivers, as the literal Greek term does, but both names refer to the same region. - The Red Sea (also the Erythraean Sea) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To the north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). The Red Sea is a Global 200 ecoregion. The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which is part of the Great Rift Valley. What object entity has the relation of 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with the subject 'ebla'?

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

Information: - The Tortricidae are a family of moths, commonly known as tortrix moths or leafroller moths, in the order Lepidoptera. Tortricidae is a large family with over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus \\"Heliocosma\\" is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back producing a rather rounded profile. - Olethreutinae is a subfamily of moth in the family Tortricidae. - In biological classification, especially zoology, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name. - \`\` Lasperesia '' and \`\` Lespeyresia '' redirect here . These are misspellings of Laspeyresia , which was invalidly established for the genus Cydia and actually refers to the noctuid moth genus Laspeyria . Cydia is a large genus of tortrix moths , belonging to the tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae . Its distinctness from and delimitation versus the tribe 's type genus Grapholita requires further study . Moths in this genus are generally small and dull brown ; their caterpillars are yellow or white and wormlike . Cydia includes many species of economic importance due to the damage their caterpillars inflict as pests of agricultural crops , especially fruit and nut trees . On the other hand , some Cydia species have been used for biological control of invasive weeds , and many of these small moths and their caterpillars are an important food source for other animals . A few species from the Hawaiian Islands are suspected to be extinct due to disappearance of their foodplants . Another well - known species is the Jumping Bean Moth ( C. deshaisiana ) , whose caterpillars live in Sebastiania seeds , turning them into the famous \`\` Mexican jumping beans '' . - Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said.

The case further established that during an investigatory stop, a police officer's search is confined to the minimum necessary to determine whether the suspect is armed, allowing the officer to protect themselves and others nearby. This restricted search authority during a Terry stop (investigatory stop) to weapons only."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Process: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose lungs that breathe in air efficiently happens, how will it affect shortness of breath. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned supposes that lungs breathe in air more efficiently, and we need to consider how this would affect shortness of breath and whether it impacts the breathing process directly or indirectly. When lungs breathe in air efficiently, it means that more oxygen is getting into the lungs and thus into the bloodstream quickly. The process remains the same, but the speed and efficiency of the process are increased: 1. You breathe in, and air enters your lungs faster and more effectively. 2. Air flows through the bronchial branches in your lungs, reaching the alveoli more efficiently. 3. Oxygen diffuses through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries more rapidly, allowing more oxygen to enter the bloodstream. 4. Red blood cells receive more oxygen from the alveoli, allowing them to deliver more oxygen to tissues and organs. 5. Carbon dioxide is picked up by the red blood cells, replacing the oxygen. 6. You breathe out, expelling carbon dioxide from your lungs. In the context of this perturbation hypothesis, shortness of breath (dyspnea) would likely be reduced or less frequent. Shortness of breath occurs when the body cannot get enough oxygen or get rid of enough carbon dioxide, potentially due to lung or heart issues. If the lungs are breathing in air more efficiently, the body would be better equipped to handle its oxygen needs and carbon dioxide removal. This more efficient process would alleviate some of the causes related to shortness of breath. The supposed perturbation affects the process more directly, as it results in an overall improvement in both the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli as well as the speed at which this exchange occurs. However, it is essential to note that efficient lung function is just one factor contributing to shortness of breath. Other factors, such as heart conditions, poor physical fitness, or other underlying health issues, may still contribute to breathing difficulties regardless of the efficiency of the lungs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's examine the information given in both statements: 1. Statement 1: \\"A puppy is trying to catch a rabbit.\\" - The animal in question is a puppy. - The puppy is engaged in an act of chasing a rabbit. - There is no indication of the puppy's physical appearance or its environment. 2. Statement 2: \\"A white dog with red ears is running in the snow.\\" - The animal in question is a dog. - The dog has specific physical characteristics: it is white with red ears. - The dog is running (a type of movement that can align with chasing behavior). - The environment is characterized by the presence of snow. Based on these points, we can try to relate the two statements: - The animal: A puppy is a young dog, so it is possible that the subject of the first statement (the puppy) could be the same as the subject in the second one (the dog). However, this assumption cannot be made with certainty based on the information provided. - The behavior: In both statements, the animal is described as engaging in some sort of movement (attempting to catch a rabbit and running). It could be inferred that running is an appropriate action when trying to catch a rabbit. However, this connection is still insufficient evidence to directly conclude that the two statements describe the same situation. - The physical appearance: There is no information available in the first statement to establish a connection with the specific physical characteristics described in the second statement, i.e., a white dog with red ears. - The environment: The first statement doesn't provide any details about the environment in which the puppy is trying to catch the rabbit. Thus, we cannot assume that the event takes place in a snowy environment, as described in the second statement. In conclusion, while some aspects of the two statements might have some connections (the animal and the behavior), there is not enough information presented to directly conclude that \\"A white dog with red ears is running in the snow\\" when given the statement, \\"A puppy is trying to catch a rabbit.\\" These statements could potentially describe the same event, but they could also be about completely different situations. Additional context and details would be necessary to establish a stronger link between the two statements."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the below context: The film is set in an alternative-history version of nineteenth century England where packs of wolves roam the countryside.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name whose older sister hears nothing but praise from their mother? from the following article ? Connie Wyatt is a restless 15-year-old who is anxious to explore the pleasures of her sexual awakening. Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains at the house, supposedly to watch over it while they are gone.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table at decreased level, sixteenth century or twentieth century? Answer:","completion":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table at a decreased level. Step 1: Identify changes in vegetation and land usage throughout the centuries. In the sixteenth century, Michigan had forests all over, including elm and oak trees. In contrast, the twentieth century saw the northeastern part of the state cleared of vegetation and wooded areas replaced by farmlands. Step 2: Understand the impact of irrigation on the water table. The paragraph mentions that in the twentieth century, all these farmlands were under heavy irrigation. This increased need for water to sustain these farmlands would have required the extraction of water from the ground, resulting in a decreased water table. Step 3: Combine information from steps 1 and 2 to arrive at a conclusion.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Pavement was formed in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for 1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed 800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it.\\" The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.

Biologist noticed that 60 percent of the Siberian Tigers have leucism, and another 40 percent have albinism. They labeled the first group as group A and the latter one as group B. They need to find the reasons for this phenomenon. Which group would not only have reduced melanin, group A or group B? Hint: Leucism (/ˈluːsɪzəm, -kɪz-/)[1][2][3] is a condition in which there is partial loss of pigmentation in an animal resulting in white, pale, or patchy coloration of the skin, hair, feathers, scales or cuticle, but not the eyes.[3] It is occasionally spelled leukism. Unlike albinism, it is caused by a reduction in multiple types of pigment, not just melanin. A:","completion":"Based on the provided hint, both leucism and albinism are conditions resulting from a loss or reduction of pigmentation. However, there are differences between the two. Leucism (Group A) is a partial loss of pigmentation, which results in white, pale, or patchy coloration of the skin, hair, feathers, scales, or cuticle, but not the eyes. This condition is caused by a reduction in multiple types of pigment, which includes melanin but may also involve other pigments. Albinism (Group B), on the other hand, is a congenital absence of pigmentation specifically due to a near-total or total lack of melanin production. This results in a complete absence of color in the skin, hair, and eyes. Albino animals typically have very light-colored or completely white skin, hair, or feathers, and their eyes may appear pink or red due to a lack of pigmentation. To answer your question, Group B (the albino group) would have a more significant reduction in melanin as compared to Group A (the leucistic group). This is because albinism is characterized by a near-total or total absence of melanin production, whereas leucism is a partial loss of pigmentation involving a reduction in multiple types of pigment, not just melanin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: What are the two shortest field goals made?","completion":"Title: The Tale of the Shortest Field Goals in Football History Introduction Field goals are among the most crucial aspects of American football, as they have the power to decide the outcome of a game with their consistent point-scoring abilities. Unlike the unpredictability of touchdowns, field goals have become increasingly reliable over the years, and their significance has grown tremendously. Though field goal distances can vary wildly, with some reaching over 60 yards, it's a rarity for extremely short field goals to be attempted, let alone executed. In this article, we delve into the rather unusual tale of the two shortest field goals ever made in football history. The Shortest Field Goals: A Rare Occurrence A typical field goal happens when the offensive team opts to kick the ball through the goalposts during its fourth down instead of attempting to continue its drive. Most professional teams have a field goal kicker, specifically trained and skilled in this department to successfully score points from a variety of distances. However, when we talk about unusually short field goals, we are discussing attempts made from a distance of fewer than 10 yards – a highly unusual event in football. 1. Detroit Lions vs. New Orleans Saints, 1970 – 8-Yard Field Goal The first of our two shortest field goal attempts took place on November 8, 1970, during a game between the Detroit Lions and the New Orleans Saints. The Lions' hall of fame kicker, Errol Mann, is credited with successfully executing an 8-yard field goal, considered one of the shortest distances in NFL history. The game took place in Tulane Stadium, New Orleans, and was part of the season's Week 7. This particular field goal was set up due to a fumble by the Saints' quarterback Billy Kilmer, which occurred at the New Orleans 1-yard line. On the following play, the Lions tried to rush for a touchdown but were stopped at the 1-yard line by the Saints' defense. In a striking move, the Lions chose to kick a field goal from the 8-yard line rather than trying to force a touchdown. Mann made good on this rare opportunity, securing his place in history with a successful 8-yard field goal attempt. 2. New England Patriots vs. Buffalo Bills, 1976 – 9-Yard Field Goal The second-shortest field goal attempt in NFL history took place on September 19, 1976. John Smith of the New England Patriots managed to successfully kick a 9-yard field goal, setting a then-record that would only be outdone by Mann's feat several years later. The Patriots faced off against their division rivals, the Buffalo Bills, who were led by Hall of Fame coach Chuck Knox. Despite the length of the field goal, Smith's attempt proved to be a crucial moment in a tightly contested game that was eventually won by the Patriots with a score of 26-22. The Factors Behind Short Field Goals Short field goals are highly infrequent in football due to the inherent risks and low rewards associated with such an attempt. An offensive team is more likely to attempt a touchdown from close range, especially when the distance to the goal line is under 10 yards. If a team cannot convert a touchdown from that distance, it is often wiser to \\"go for it\\" on the fourth down instead of opting for a field goal. Another notable factor is the change in field goal post positioning over the years. In 1974, the NFL moved the goalposts from the goal line to the end line, making short field goals virtually impossible in today's game. This move added an additional 10 yards to field goal distances, eliminating the potential for any future attempts under 10 yards in the NFL. Conclusion The shortest field goals in football history, made by Errol Mann and John Smith, represent a fascinating chapter in the sport's competitive evolution. The 8 and 9-yard attempts showcase the interplay of strategy, unpredictability, and skill in professional football and serve as a reminder of how the game has evolved over the years. While we may never see such unusually short field goals again, they undoubtedly remain etched in the memories of football enthusiasts as exceptional moments in the annals of NFL history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Atletico Madrid players and coaching staff were visibly frustrated with the referee's decision to allow five minutes of second-half injury time, which they considered excessive. Their frustration was understandable, as Los Rojiblancos had successfully maintained their one-goal lead throughout the majority of the match and were just minutes away from securing their first-ever Champions League title. As the clock ticked away during the injury time, Real Madrid's persistence finally paid off when Sergio Ramos headed home a corner kick in the last minute of stoppage time, dramatically leveling the score and forcing the match into extra time. This last-gasp goal sent shockwaves through the Atletico Madrid camp, as they were left shell-shocked and deflated, with their dream of lifting the Champions League trophy slipping through their fingers. In the extra-time, Atletico Madrid's exhaustion and disappointment began to show on the pitch. Real Madrid, invigorated by their late equalizer, took full advantage of their rival's physical and mental state. Los Blancos scored three more goals through Gareth Bale, Marcelo, and Cristiano Ronaldo, completing their comeback from a one-goal deficit to beat Atletico Madrid, 4-1. Simeone's frustrations compounded throughout the game, culminating in his confrontations with the referee and Varane. He believed the officials had dealt Atletico numerous injustices, including the controversial allowance of extended injury time. This, in his mind, had significantly contributed to their collapse in the final stages of the match. The defeat was a devastating blow to Atletico, who had previously won La Liga for the first time in 18 years, just a week before the Champions League final. After defying the odds and toppling La Liga giants, Barcelona and Real Madrid, in the domestic league, their European dream was brought to a grinding halt. Despite the heart-wrenching loss, Diego Simeone and his Atletico Madrid side would go on to be a formidable force in European football in the coming seasons. They have consistently finished among the top teams in the Champions League, and although they have not yet claimed the prestigious trophy, their resilience and determination to compete at the highest level are a testament to Simeone's impact on the club. In conclusion, the pivotal moment in the 2014 Champions League final, where Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid looked set to etch their names into history, ended in an agonizing flourish of goals from their local rivals. Despite every challenge thrown their way, Atletico's journey to the final demonstrated their tenacity and ability to defy expectations. While the disappointment of that night still lingers, it serves as motivation for Simeone and his players to continue striving for glory in the years to come."},{"prompt":"Definition: You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

Choices: - ham - splurp - sping - splog - blam The rationale to choose \\"sping\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"sping.\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"sping\\" as the answer to the question \\"What is the ping sent from a spam blog called?\\" from the given choices: ham, splurp, sping, splog, and blam, is based on the understanding of the following concepts: 1. Ping: In the context of blogging, a ping is an XML-RPC signal sent from a blog to a server, such as a blog search engine or an update service, to notify them of new content added or updates made to the blog. This enables real-time indexing, faster discoverability, and improves the overall visibility of the content. 2. Spam blog (splog): A spam blog or a splog is a blog that is created solely for search engine manipulation, advertising, or to generate affiliate or pay-per-click revenue. It contains low-quality content, often stolen or scraped from other legitimate sources, with minimal to no originality or usefulness. Splogs are detrimental to the blogging ecosystem, as they clutter the search results, waste resources, and affect the user experience. 3. Sping: A sping, sometimes also referred to as spam ping, is a ping sent from a spam blog. It is specifically designed to deceive search engines, update services, and aggregators into believing that the splog has updated or created new content. Spings are used to gain an unfair advantage over genuine blogs in terms of search engine rankings, visibility, and traffic. They also contribute to the spam and noise prevalent in the blogging environment. The remaining choices do not correctly define a ping sent from a spam blog: - Ham: In the context of spam filtering, ham refers to legitimate email or content that is not considered spam. It does not relate to pings or spam blogs. - Splurp: Splurp does not have a recognized meaning or definition in the context of spam blogs or pings. - Splog: As mentioned earlier, \\"splog\\" refers to a spam blog, not the ping sent from one. - Blam: Blam does not relate to spam blogs or pings and has no recognized meaning or definition in this context. Based on the understanding and elimination of the other choices, \\"sping\\" is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the concept of a ping sent from a spam blog."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: BENGHAZI, LIBYA - Gunfire erupted in at least three neighborhoods of the Libyan capital of Tripoli Friday, as opponents of Moammar Gaddafi tried to revive their protests against his regime in spite of a massive security clampdown. Hours earlier, Libyan state television announced that the government would distribute 400 to each family in a bid to head off fresh demonstrations called for by regime opponents after Friday's midday prayers. It was the first time the regime--which also pledged pay hikes for state employees of up to 150 percent-- has attempted to offer incentives to Libyans to remain loyal. Gunfire was reported shortly after prayers finished, suggesting that some protesters were attempting to take to the streets, said a caller from Tripoli who requested anonymity because he feared for his life. But it was unclear whether Tripoli's residents would be able to counter the massive presence of police, army soldiers and paramilitaries who descended on the city Thursday evening to protect one of Gaddafi's last remaining strongholds. \\"Everybody's suspicious, worried, afraid, because we have families,\\" said the caller, a trader who said he did not dare go out to protest. Gunshots could be heard over the telephone line. \\"We are 10 percent afraid for ourselves and 90 percent afraid for our families. They won't just shoot us, maybe they will get revenge on the whole household, the whole family, even the whole street. \\"These people have no mercy,\\" the caller added. \\"We have known them for 42 years.\\" \\"Fear, fear, fear,\\" was how another businessman described the mood in the city Thursday evening. But he nonetheless predicted a big turnout for Friday's demonstrations. \\"It's now or never,\\" he said of the effort to intensify the rebellion in Gaddafi's stronghold, where forces loyal to the Libyan leader forcefully suppressed an earlier wave of protests. Across the Middle East and North Africa, demonstrators again gathered on the Muslim holy day to call for democracy and government reforms. In Iraq, tens of thousands of Iraqis defied curfews to take the the streets for what was billed as \\"A Day of Rage.\\" Several deaths were reported. In Cairo, thousands of Egyptians gathered in Tahrir Square to commemorate the beginning of their revolution exactly one month ago, and to remind the military council ruling the country that many demands remain unmet. A strong undercurrent of support for neighboring Libya was palpable, with chants and banners proclaiming \\"Egypt and Libya, we are one.\\" The Egyptian demonstrators called on the Supreme Military Council to replace the prime minister and his cabinet, lift a long-standing and repressive emergency law and put the interior ministry police under civilian control. \\"We don't want this government,\\" said Mariam Abdel Rehim, 27, who is working on a master's degree in physical education. \\"It was formed by the former president.\\" ||||| Patrick Baz, AFP / Getty Images Libya's embattled Col. Moammar Gadhafi compared himself to Queen Elizabeth today while blaming the violent uprising in his country on Osama bin Laden and what he said were drugged-up and armed Libyan teenagers.\\"Bin Laden ... this is the enemy who is manipulating people,\\" Gadhafi said. \\"Do not be swayed by bin Laden.\\"Gadhafi was expected to appear on state television today but instead spoke via telephone for 20 minutes in an often bizarre, disjointed monologue while the in-studio anchor was forced to stare at the camera without interrupting.The dictator's speech came after reports that his cousin, Ahmed Gadhaf al-Dam, a high-ranking member of his inner circle, had fled to Egypt and that Gadhafi was rapidly losing support from other loyalists.\\"He's scared,\\" one protester told Al-Jazeera television after Gadhafi's speech. \\"He was supposed to show himself on TV today but instead he's in hiding because he knows he's on the way out.\\"Gadhafi often sounded like a crazily out-of-touch father figure as he warned Libyans to control their children and get them off the streets.Despite evidence that many of the protesters are in their 20s and older, Gadhafi said the uprising was being fomented by teen-agers who had been given pills by enemies of the regime.\\"Get ahold of your children and get them at home,\\" Gadhafi said. \\"Those teen-agers are trigger-happy and they shoot at anything, especially when they're stoned on drugs. There's nobody over 20 out there.\\"Gadhafi also portrayed himself as a symbolic figure, like the \\"queen of England,\\" and said he had only \\"moral authority\\" over the nation. He said he could not enact laws and that the true power was in the hands of the people.He made no concessions other than to say that state salaries might be \\"reconsidered.\\"However, just hours before he spoke, there were unconfirmed reports out of Az Zawiyah, 30 miles outside Tripoli, that more than 100 people had been fired on by soldiers loyal to Gadhafi this morning and an unknown number killed.Though at least 1,000 people reportedly have been killed in Libya since the uprising began, Gadhafi gave his condolences to the families of just four people, members of his state security forces who were killed.\\"It's all because of bin Laden,\\" Gadhafi said. \\"Al-Qaida is manipulating our country. They don't care about you, they just want to kill your kids so you can have control.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"Protests against Moammar Gaddafi's regime intensified in Tripoli, Libya, despite a heightened security presence.

Product review: I happened upon this cd at a store that is no longer open here in Columbus, a little store called Camelot Records. I loved going there on my days off and sifting through all the bins looking at obscure titles, just like this one. The reason I bought this cd is because I recognize Bunny's name from the thousands of artist's she sang back up for, so I trusted the material contained within. \\"Talking With The Angels\\" is my favorite track, the album as a whole is thoroughly enjoyable and contrary to the jazz label, the music is not jazz, but straight up pop. The production is flawless for pop music and listening to Bunny's clear voice, it's easy to understand why she is in such demand for backing sessions for other artists. I wish her solo catalog was a bit more accessable. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"This review depicts the product in a generally flattering light. The reviewer provides various positive aspects they enjoyed about the CD and sheds light on the reasons behind their purchase. They recognized Bunny's name as a talented back-up singer for numerous other artists, which led them to trust the material within the CD. Their appreciation for the store where they found the CD establishes a nostalgic connection that enhances the listener's experience. The reviewer's favorite track, \\"Talking With The Angels,\\" is mentioned, indicating that they were familiar with the songs and enjoyed them. Furthermore, they stated that the album is \\"thoroughly enjoyable\\" and contrary to the jazz label, it is described as straight up pop. This could be considered a compliment, as it sets the CD apart from typical jazz, potentially making it more appealing to a wider audience. Additionally, the mention of the \\"flawless\\" production for pop music further underlines the quality of the CD. Despite the flattering aspects, there is a small unflattering note in the review. The reviewer mentioned how they wished Bunny's solo catalog was more accessible. While this could imply the album was genuinely enjoyable to the point that the reviewer sought more material from the artist, it also infers that the CD is somewhat rare and potentially difficult to acquire. In conclusion, the review generally portrays the CD in a positive and flattering light with only a minor hint of negativity regarding the accessibility of Bunny's solo catalog. The detailed insight into the reviewer's experience and appreciation for the music highlights the CD's high-quality production and enjoyable listening experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bereits heute können Landwirte Verträge mit der Industrie, mit der Milchindustrie, über bestimmte Mengen zu Festpreisen abschließen. Translate to English","completion":"Already today, farmers can enter into contracts with industry, specifically with the milk industry, for fixed quantities at fixed prices. In today's global economy, farmers have the opportunity to establish contracts with various industries, such as the milk industry, to secure a stable income and ensure a constant supply of their products. These contracts, known as forward contracts or futures contracts, allow farmers to agree on a specific quantity of their goods to be delivered to the industry at a predetermined price over a given time frame. Entering into these contracts not only benefits the farmers but also the industries and consumers. Fixed prices in the contracts provide financial stability to farmers and help them make long-term plans for their business. Furthermore, they can secure funding for investments in their farms, knowing that they have a guaranteed income. For the industries, having a stable supply of raw materials ensures that they can maintain their production levels and plan their business strategies accordingly. It reduces the risk of disruption due to shortages of raw materials or unpredictable market fluctuations. Additionally, long-term contracts can lead to cost savings, as industries can better plan their production processes, minimize waste, and optimize their logistics. Consumers benefit from these contracts as well since they contribute to the stabilization of prices for the final products. A continuous supply of raw materials to industries and transparent pricing mechanisms helps prevent sudden price hikes or shortages of goods in the market, ensuring that consumers have access to what they need. Moreover, these types of contracts have an impact on sustainability in agriculture. By guaranteeing a specific revenue regardless of the market conditions, farmers can focus on adopting more sustainable farming practices, enhancing crop cycle management, and preserving their land's long-term viability. In conclusion, fixed quantity and fixed price contracts between farmers and industries, such as the milk industry, provide stability and predictability for farmers, industries, and consumers alike.

Q:I read this background article the other day: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication). Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] I am facing a new situation today: Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which path will be marched over less frequently? A:","completion":"Based on the information given in the background article, the ants follow and reinforce pheromone trails that lead to food sources. The article also elaborates that the more time an ant takes to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. Given Ricky's situation, where path A is approximately 100 meters and path B is approximately 150 meters, it's reasonable to conclude that ants will take longer to travel through path B and back than path A due to its longer length. Consequently, the pheromone trail on path B is likely to evaporate more than that on path A, reducing its attractive strength. From the knowledge acquired, it can therefore be concluded that path B will be marched over less frequently by the ants compared to path A. This is due to the process of pheromone evaporation, making path A with its stronger and more consistent pheromone density a more preferred route by the ants. My step-by-step reasoning includes the understanding the behavior of ants, the correlation between the path length, pheromone evaporation, and the frequency of the marching over paths, and finally the application of these principles to the specifics of Ricky's situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Namdev, also transliterated as Namdeo and Namadeva, (traditionally, c. 1270 - c. 1350) was a poet-saint from Maharashtra, India who is significant to the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism, as well as Hindu warrior-ascetic traditions such as the Dadupanthis and the Niranjani Sampraday that emerged in north India during the Islamic rule. The details of Namdev's life are unclear. He is the subject of many miracle-filled hagiographies composed centuries after he died. Context: The literary works of Namdev were influenced by Vaishnava philosophy and a belief in Vithoba. Along with the Jnanesvari, a sacred work of Jnanesvar, and of Bhakti movement teacher-writers such as Tukaram, the writings of Namdev form the basis of the beliefs held by the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He was thus among those responsible for disseminating the monotheistic Varkari faith that had emerged first in Karnataka in the mid-to-late 12th century and then spread to Pandharpur in Maharashtra. Namdev and Jnanesvar used the Marathi language to convey their beliefs rather than using the traditional Sanskrit language that was essentially a buttress for the pre-eminence of the Brahmin priests. Namdev's style was to compose simply worded praise for Vithoba and to use a melodic device called samkirtana, both of which were accessible to common people. Shima Iwao says that \\"He taught that all can be saved equally, without regard to caste, through devotion (bhakti) to Vithoba\\" and that he greatly influenced groups of people who were forbidden by the Brahmin elite from studying the Vedas, such as women and members of the Shudra and untouchable communities. The earliest anthological record of Namdev's works occurs in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scriptures compiled in 1604, although Novetzke notes that while the manuscript records of Namdev mostly date from the 17th and 18th centuries, there exists a manuscript from 1581 that presents a rarely recounted variant version of Namdev's Tirthavli, a Marathi-language autobiographical piece. It is evident that the Guru Granth record is an accurate rendition of what Namdev wrote: the oral tradition probably accounts significantly for the changes and additions that appear to have been made by that time. The numerous subsequently produced manuscripts also show variant texts and additions that are attributed to him. Of around 2500 abhangs that were credited to him and written in the Marathi language, perhaps only 600 - 700 are authentic. The surviving manuscripts are geographically dispersed and of uncertain provenance. Question: Did anything else come out of Namdev's teachings? Answer:","completion":"Yes, apart from the significant impact on the Varkari sect of Hinduism and the influence on the Sikh faith, Namdev's teachings had several other outcomes: 1. Promotion of the Marathi language: Namdev, along with other Bhakti movement poets such as Jnanesvar and Tukaram, helped popularize the Marathi language as a medium for conveying spiritual and philosophical ideas. This went against the prevailing trend of using Sanskrit, a language mostly accessible to the Brahmin priests. In doing so, he made spiritual teachings accessible to a wider audience. 2. Championing social equality: Namdev's teachings emphasized that all individuals, regardless of their caste, gender, or social standing, could achieve spiritual salvation through devotion (bhakti) to Vithoba. This approach contradicted the Brahminical ideology prevalent at the time and played a crucial role in breaking down social barriers and promoting spiritual equality. 3. Encouraging the use of music and arts: Namdev's style incorporated simple, melodious compositions called samkirtana, which were easily accessible and enjoyed by common people. This approach fostered an appreciation for music and the arts as means to express devotion and connect with the divine. 4. Inspiring subsequent generations of poets and saints: Namdev's teachings formed the basis for the beliefs of the Varkari sect of Hinduism, and his works greatly influenced future poets, saints, and spiritual practitioners. His emphasis on devotion, social equality, and the use of local languages inspired many followers to continue exploring similar themes in their own works. In conclusion, Namdev's teachings had far-reaching effects not only on Varkari sect of Hinduism and Sikhism, but also on language, social equality, arts, and future generations of poets and spiritual leaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was imprisoned in Stirling in 1694? from the following article ? Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists.

Given the question: Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. Which pot is closer to boiling? Hint: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to determine which pot is closer to boiling based on the information provided about the average kinetic energy of the particles in each pot. Step 1: Analyze the given information Pot A: Particles with very high average kinetic energy Pot B: Particles with low average kinetic energy Step 2: Relate average kinetic energy to temperature We know that the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature. So, if the average kinetic energy is higher, the temperature is also higher, and vice versa. Step 3: Compare the temperature of pot A and pot B Based on the given information, the particles in pot A have a higher average kinetic energy than those in pot B, which means that pot A has a higher temperature. Step 4: Determine which pot is closer to boiling Since boiling occurs at a specific temperature for a given substance (e.g., 100°C for water at sea level), the pot with the higher temperature will be closer to boiling. Conclusion: Pot A is closer to boiling, because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy, which corresponds to a higher temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is set against the backdrop of the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 CE) and the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE) in China, a time fraught with chaos, political strife, and constant warfare. Zhou Yu, born in a humble military family, grows up witnessing the suffering of his people under the tyranny of the Eastern Han Empire. Gifted with exceptional martial skills, intellect, and a strong commitment to restoring peace in the land, Zhou Yu sets his sights on overthrowing the oppressive rulers and unifying the fragmented kingdoms. As the story unfolds, Zhou Yu befriends the brilliant military strategist, Zhuge Liang, played by John Cho, who shares the same vision of a unified China and a prosperous future for their people. Together, they form a strong alliance and combine their military prowess to challenge the ruling Eastern Han Dynasty and other threatening warlords vying for power. In the midst of their quest to bring change to their homeland, both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang find themselves in a tangled web of alliances, betrayals, and political machinations. They encounter a diverse array of historical characters, including the cunning Cao Cao, the ambitious Sun Quan, and the enigmatic Zhu Geliang, all brilliantly played by an ensemble of renowned Asian actors. In one of the story's pivotal moments, Zhou Yu and his forces successfully defend the kingdom of Wu, led by Sun Quan, from a massive invasion orchestrated by Cao Cao. Through their mutual respect and unwavering determination, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang form an ever-stronger bond, symbolized by the iconic Red Phoenix (representing Zhou Yu) and the White Dragon (representing Zhuge Liang). As Zhou Yu's fame and influence grow, so does the desire of others, friends and foes alike, to see him fall. Zhou Yu faces several attempts on his life and a series of heartbreaking betrayals, testing the depths of his loyalty to his cause and the strength of his friendship with Zhuge Liang. Amidst these challenges, Zhou Yu finds solace in the love of his wife, Xiao Qiao, played by Gemma Chan, who supports and encourages him to overcome adversity and follow his destiny. As the movie reaches its climax, the \\"Battle of the Red Phoenix\\" takes center stage. The symbolic Red Phoenix, representing the indomitable spirit of Zhou Yu, clashes against powerful enemies in the final battle for their homeland's future. Friends' loyalties are tested, sacrifices are made, and legends are born in this epic confrontation. However, plots and intrigues within their own ranks leave Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang with a bittersweet victory. Ultimately, they succeed in laying the groundwork for a more united China, becoming prominent figures in the history of the Three Kingdoms period.

Since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching, or underneath, the ropes, many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes. This is called a \\"rope break\\", and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold. Most holds leave an arm or leg free, so that the person can tap out if they want. Instead, they use these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes (the bottom one is the most common, as it is nearest the wrestlers, though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as Chris Masters' Master Lock) or drape their foot across, or underneath one. Once this has been accomplished, and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee, the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold, and start counting to five if the wrestler does not.

For simplicity, let's assume that those factors are equal for both paths.

The announcement clears the way for Paris to hold the Olympics in 2024. The L.A. City Council will hold an ad-hoc meeting on Friday to discuss accepting the deal, said spokeswoman Caolinn Mejza. The IOC said it will give the Los Angeles organizing committee 1.8 billion as part of the agreement. The incentive package aims in part to \\"increase participation and access to youth sports programmes in the City of Los Angeles in the years leading up to the Games,\\" according to an IOC statement. Related: Paris and Los Angeles set to get 2024 and 2028 Olympics Earlier this month, the IOC broke with tradition by deciding to award two games at once. It said the 2024 and 2028 games would go to Paris and Los Angeles -- it just hadn't decided which city would get which year. The decision will be finalized in September. Paris and Los Angeles were the only competitors left for 2024 after rival cities pulled their bids because of worries over cost. Hosting a modern Olympics practically guarantees massive debt and cost overruns. Researchers at Oxford's Saïd Business School estimate the cost overrun for the 2016 Summer Olympics, in Rio de Janeiro, was 1.6 billion. Officials from Paris and Los Angeles had stressed that their cities already have more than 90% of the facilities they need to host, reducing the additional cost. In a statement, the team organizing Paris' 2024 bid said it \\"welcomes\\" the news. \\"We are now looking forward to the opportunity of working with Los Angeles, and contributing to successful Games both in 2024 and 2028,\\" said Tony Estanguet, the team's co-chair. French President Emmanuel Macron also hailed the decision as an \\"important step.\\" Related: Why nobody wants to host the Olympic Games President Trump offered his congratulations to Los Angeles in a statement Monday night. \\"I am confident that the Summer Games in Los Angeles will exemplify both the Olympic ideal and the American spirit, and we look forward to hosting them,\\" Trump said. This is the first time the Summer Olympics will be held in the U.S. since the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Los Angeles also hosted the summer games in 1932 and 1984. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti hailed the new arrangement as \\"a major step toward bringing the Games back to our city for the first time in a generation.\\" \\"What we were able to negotiate, this deal was too good to pass up,\\" Garcetti said Monday night. He said the planning committee estimates that the games will cost 5.3 billion. The IOC, local sponsorships and ticket sales cover costs, while the city will receive federal support for security, Garcetti said. -- CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed reporting. ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles has reached an agreement with international Olympic leaders that will open the way for the city to host the 2028 Summer Games. City Council President Herb Wesson's office confirmed the deal Monday. Spokeswoman Caolinn Mejza says the pact is expected to be reviewed by the council later this week. The agreement to be formally announced later Monday follows a vote earlier this month by the International Olympic Committee to seek a deal to award the 2024 and 2028 Games. Paris is the only city left to host the 2024 Games. The arrangement would make LA a three-time Olympic city, after hosting the 1932 and 1984 Games. LA and Paris were the last two bids remaining after a tumultuous process that exposed the unwillingness of cities to bear the financial burden of hosting an event that has become synonymous with cost overruns. LA was not even the first American entrant in the contest. Boston withdrew two years ago as public support for its bid collapsed over concerns about use of taxpayer cash. The U.S. bid switched from the east to the West Coast as LA entered the race. But the same apprehensions that spooked politicians and the local population in Boston soon became evident in Europe where three cities pulled out. Uncomfortably for IOC President Thomas Bach, whose much-vaunted Agenda 2020 reforms were designed to make hosting more streamlined and less costly after the lavish 2014 Sochi Games, the first withdrawal came from his homeland of Germany. The lack of political unity for a bid in Hamburg was mirrored in Rome and Budapest as support for bids waned among local authorities and the population. It was clear they did not want to be saddled with skyrocketing bills for hosting the Olympics without reaping many of the economic benefits anticipated. Just like in the depleted field for the 2022 Winter Games which saw Beijing defeat Almaty, the IOC was left with only two candidates again. With two powerful cities left vying for 2024, Bach realized France or the U.S. could be deterred from going through another contest for 2028 if they lost. Bach floated the idea in December of making revisions to the bidding process to prevent it producing \\"too many losers,\\" building support that led to LA and Paris being able to figure out themselves how to share the 2024 and 2028 Games. The dual award of the games relieves the IOC of having to test the global interest in hosting the Summer Olympics for several years until the 2032 Games are up for grabs. ___ AP Sports Writer Rob Harris in London contributed. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Los Angeles has agreed a deal with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the Summer Olympics in 2028, paving the way for Paris to host the games in 2024. The two cities were the last remaining bidders for 2024 after other cities withdrew due to financial concerns. As part of the agreement, the IOC will provide the Los Angeles organising committee with 1.8bn, part of which will be used to increase youth participation in sport. This will be the first time the Summer Olympics have been held in the US since the 1996 games in Atlanta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A: Choices: A). lung system; B). skeletal system; C). muscular system; D). digestive system; The answer is:","completion":"D). Digestive System. Diarrhea due to food poisoning is an example of a problem involving the digestive system. The digestive system is a vital organ system responsible for breaking down the food we consume, absorbing its nutrients, and converting them into energy to support our body's functions. It includes several organs and structures, such as the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. When food poisoning occurs, harmful bacteria, viruses, or toxins contaminate the food we ingest. Upon entering the digestive system, these harmful agents can disrupt its normal functioning, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is a particularly notable symptom as it involves heightened frequency, increased fluid content, or a reduction in solid matter in bowel movements - upsetting the body's process of removing waste and maintaining a balance of electrolytes. As a result, it can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or in severe cases, even organ damage or death. In conclusion, diarrhea due to food poisoning is a problem related to the digestive system, as the ingestion of contaminated food leads to the disruption of the organs within this system, causing discomfort and potentially serious consequences for the individual affected. It is crucial to practice proper food safety and hygiene techniques to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses and ensure the digestive system functions efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more eating happens, how will it affect more movement. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"In order to analyze the perturbation hypothesis and its effect on the process, we need to consider each step of the process in the context of the hypothesis: 1. The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat. Perturbation: Suppose more eating happens. If the animal consumes even larger quantities of food than usual, it will store more fat in its body. This increased energy storage might hypothetically enable the animal to engage in more movement, as it would have a greater energy reserve to draw from. 2. Winter comes, and the animal finds a place to hibernate. Regardless of the increased food intake, the animal will still reach the point when it needs to find a place to hibernate, since winter and hibernation are part of its natural life cycle. The additional fat storage might, however, provide better insulation for the animal during the hibernation period. 3. Over a period of days, the animal's heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly. The increased fat storage may affect the animal's heart rate and breathing rate during the transition to hibernation. However, these rates will still generally drop when the animal starts to hibernate. 4. Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active. The additional fat storage does not directly affect electrical activity in the brain during hibernation. This process will remain largely unaffected by the perturbation. 5. The animal has entered hibernation mode. Once the animal has entered the hibernation mode, its movement is severely limited. The additional fat storage would not affect the animal's ability to move while in hibernation. In conclusion, the perturbation of increased eating does have some indirect effects on the process, predominantly in the animal's movement before it begins to hibernate (due to increased energy reserves) and potentially through better insulation during hibernation. However, once in hibernation mode, it is unlikely that there would be a significant increase in movement as hibernation is characterized by its severely limited mobility and metabolic suppression. The greater fat reserves could instead increase the duration of the hibernation period or improve the animal's survival rate during winter."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Thought to be a meteorite, they later find out it is a craft containing an alien lifeform. Trying to adapt to the Earth's atmosphere, it latches on to the first organism it finds - the museum's most notable exhibit, a frozen Wooly mammoth. A security guard witnesses the revival of the prehistoric elephant, which kills the guard. With the creature on the loose, two government agents, Powers and Whitaker, track Frank down. While the agents and Frank try to figure out what happened and what to do, the mammoth heads into the forest, where it kills anyone it comes across.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring villages practiced extensive agriculture for their food supply. Leaf village used the intentional cultivation of arthropods to help them get better harvests.

Considering the logical progression of the story, I choose option 2 as the story continuation: \\"He took the car to the conference instead of the bus because the bus was slower on the freeway.\\""},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Q: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Dutch language, and you have to write the part-of-speech tag for each word and punctuation in the question. Here is the list of part-of-speech tags used in this task: Adj: Adjective, Adv: Adverb, Art: Article, Conj: Conjunction, Int: Interjection, N: Noun, V: Verb, Num: Number, Misc: Miscellaneous, Pron: Pronoun, Prep: Preposition, Punc: Punctuation. Voor het zover is , moet er echter ook een dieselmotor beschikbaar zijn . A:","completion":"Part 1: Identify words and punctuation in the question. Usage: Break the input question into words and punctuation, including spaces. Example: Voor, het, zover, is, \\",\\", moet, er, echter, ook, een, dieselmotor, beschikbaar, zijn, \\".\\". Each word and punctuation from the question is listed separately. Part 2: Assign part-of-speech tags using the given list. Usage: Use the provided list of part-of-speech tags to tag each word or punctuation. Example: \\"Voor\\" is a preposition, so the tag is \\"Prep\\". Explanation: \\"Voor\\" means \\"before\\" in English and is used to describe the relationship between the words in the question, thus it is a preposition. Part 3: Return the input in the required format. Usage: Combine both the words/punctuation and their corresponding part-of-speech tags in the required format. Example: Voor - Prep, het - Art, zover - Adv, is - V, , - Punc, moet - V, er - Adv, echter - Adv, ook - Adv, een - Art, dieselmotor - N, beschikbaar - Adj, zijn - V, . - Punc This response correctly labels each word and punctuation with their part-of-speech tags."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],E={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
