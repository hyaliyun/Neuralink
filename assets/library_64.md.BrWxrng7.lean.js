Write a title for this article: The annual Al Smith dinner in New York is that fleeting moment in time when the two candidates for president trade their political divisions for good-natured laughter — at oneself, opponents and others deemed worthy of a ribbing. Rudy Giuliani appears to have forgotten that. The reaction of the former Big Apple mayor known for his love of a good fight can only be described as that of a humorless, “nasty” man. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton roasted Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, for defending Trump’s questionable personal tax practices. Watch Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton make jokes at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, Oct. 20. (The Washington Post) As she rhetorically strolled through the dignitaries, Clinton said, “And we have Rudy Giuliani.” Just mentioning his name set off laughter. But all the camera found was the unsmiling face New Yorkers were happy was term-limited. “Now, many don’t know this,” Clinton continued, “but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, ‘If you can’t beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.’ ” The crowd roared. Giuliani sat as if he were perched on Mount Rushmore. The look on his face was a flashback moment for me. Back to those days during his mayoralty when jokes at his expense were not tolerated. Remember, this is the same guy who waged a public battle with New York magazine in 1997 ​against its ads on city buses that read, “Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn’t taken credit for.” A federal judge ordered the transportation authority to restore the ads. Of course, Giuliani disagreed and whined to the press, “I think that mayors retain certain privacy rights, particularly the right to not have your name used for a commercial purpose.” [Hillary Clinton was right. Donald Trump is ‘horrifying’] During his eight years in City Hall, Giuliani alternated between mean and nasty as he and his administration beat crime (and dissent) into submission. His critiques of opponents and adversaries were withering and personal, much like those of his preferred presidential candidate. Giuliani’s reaction Thursday night to a good-natured, yet pointed knock against him was typical for bullies. They can dish it, but they can’t take it — especially from “such a nasty woman.” Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj Subscribe to Cape Up, Jonathan Capehart’s weekly podcast Title:","completion":"\\"Al Smith Dinner: When Candidates Laugh and Rudy Giuliani Forgets to Smile\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Russian shot putter stripped of gold after doping test CBC SPORTS ONLINE - Another Olympic medallist has been stripped of a medal after failing a doping test. Russia #39;s Irina Korzhanenko will lose her shot put gold medal after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol Which topic is this article about? OPT: * World. * Sports. * Business. * Science/Tech.","completion":"This article is predominantly about the topic of Sports. The article discusses the case of Russian shot putter Irina Korzhanenko, who was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol. The incident occurred during the Olympics, a major international sporting event. Doping tests are a standard part of sports competitions, particularly at the elite level, because the use of performance-enhancing drugs provides an unfair advantage and goes against the values of fair play and sportsmanship. The story of Korzhanenko highlights the ongoing issue of doping in sports and the measures taken by sports governing bodies to ensure fair and equal competition. Doping scandals have affected numerous athletes and sports disciplines over the years, leading to increased vigilance and implementation of more stringent anti-doping regulations. While doping in sports involves science and technology in the form of the testing methods and the development of performance-enhancing substances, these aspects are secondary in this particular context. The primary focus of the article is the impact of doping on sports competitions and the consequences faced by an athlete found guilty of using prohibited substances. In conclusion, the article is focused on the Sports topic, as it deals with the disqualification of an Olympic medallist who failed a doping test, affecting her standing in the sporting world and raising questions about fairness, integrity, and the prevalence of doping in sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults. During the Punic crisis, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman Bacchus. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; Liber's festival continued. With loyalty a necessity, what censorship did not need to be enforced?","completion":"With loyalty being a necessity, censorship related to divine hierarchy did not need to be enforced. This is because, in the context provided, people were loyal to the ruling power, and their allegiance was to the various gods and goddesses regardless of their political or social standing. Since loyalty was implicit among the populace, the need to enforce a specific religious hierarchy was not as important. The continuation of Liber's festival highlights that even without political enforcement, religious cults and practices could coexist without causing disruption or requiring censorship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000.

On 8 April 1918, after the defeat in Tampere and the German army intervention, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Vyborg. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April. The escape of the leadership embittered many Reds, and thousands of them tried to flee to Russia, but most of the refugees were encircled by White and German troops. In the Lahti area they surrendered on 1-2 May. The long Red caravans included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with severe losses due to White attacks. The scene was described as a \\"road of tears\\" for the Reds, but for the Whites, the sight of long, enemy caravans heading east was a victorious moment. The Red Guards' last strongholds between the Kouvola and Kotka area fell by 5 May, after the Battle of Ahvenkoski. The war of 1918 ended on 15 May 1918, when the Whites took over Fort Ino, a Russian coastal artillery base on the Karelian Isthmus, from the Russian troops. White Finland and General Mannerheim celebrated the victory with a large military parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918. The Red Guards had been defeated. The initially pacifist Finnish labour movement had lost the Civil War, several military leaders committed suicide and a majority of the Reds were sent to prison camps. The Vaasa Senate returned to Helsinki on 4 May 1918, but the capital was under the control of the German army. White Finland had become a protectorate of the German Empire and General Rüdiger von der Goltz was called \\"the true Regent of Finland\\".

Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. But I can use this background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions.

The text starts by listing negative aspects of the movie: bad acting, lack of plot, and poor camerawork. Justification: Listing negative aspects implies a negative sentiment. 2. The text then mentions \\"absolutely brilliant moments\\" in the movie that keep the viewer hoping for more. Justification: Mentioning positive aspects can indicate a mixed sentiment, but it's important to consider if the positive elements outweigh the negatives. 3. The phrase \\"it's too little, too late\\" suggests that the positive moments are not enough to save the movie. Justification: Using phrases that carry negative implications shows a negative sentiment. 4. The text mentions that if someone enjoys specific elements, they may not want to miss this movie. However, the author doesn't appreciate those elements, resulting in a \\"pretty horrible time.\\" Justification: Acknowledging that some people may like it indicates a mixed sentiment, but the author's negative experience reaffirms the negative sentiment. 5. The mention of \\"a few absolutely brilliant jokes\\" implies that not everything is bad in the movie, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it. Justification: Stating a few positive aspects may indicate a mixed sentiment, but it reinforces that the negatives overshadow the positives. 6. Finally, the verdict of 4/10 and the statement \\"guilty of wasting my time\\" clearly show the author's negative sentiment towards the movie.

The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%.

Forks at that time were fairly large with two tines that aided in the cutting of meat in the kitchen. The tines prevented meat from twisting or moving during cutting and allowed food to slide off more easily than it would with a knife. By the 7th century A.D., royal courts of the Middle East began to use forks at the table for dining. From the 10th through the 13th centuries, forks were fairly common among the wealthy in Byzantium. In the 11th century, a Byzantine wife brought forks to Italy; however, they were not widely adopted there until the 16th century. Then in 1533, forks were brought from Italy to France. The French were also slow to accept forks, for using them was thought to be awkward. In 1608, forks were brought to England by Thomas Coryate, who saw them during his travels in Italy. The English first ridiculed forks as being unnecessary. \\"Why should a person need a fork when God had given him hands?\\" they asked. Slowly, however, forks came to be adopted by the wealthy as a symbol of their social status. They were prized possessions made of expensive materials intended to impress guests. By the mid 1600s, eating with forks was considered fashionable among the wealthy British. Early table forks were modeled after kitchen forks, but small pieces of food often fell through the two tines or slipped off easily. In late 17th century France, larger forks with four curved tines were developed. The additional tines made diners less likely to drop food, and the curved tines served as a scoop so people did not have to constantly switch to a spoon while eating. By the early 19th century, four-tined forks had also been developed in Germany and England and slowly began to spread to America. In which way did the use of forks spread?

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common.

Answer this question. \\"Which British artist painted \\"\\"The Light of the World\\"\\" and \\"\\"The Scapegoat\\"\\"?\\"","completion":"The British artist who painted \\"The Light of the World\\" and \\"The Scapegoat\\" is William Holman Hunt. Born on April 2, 1827, in Cheapside, London, he was renowned as one of the founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which was a group of artists that formed in 1848, along with John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The Pre-Raphaelite movement sought to return to the artistic principles and styles before the High Renaissance, emphasizing naturalism, vivid colors, and attention to detail. \\"The Light of the World\\" (1853-54) is one of William Holman Hunt's most famous paintings, featuring a striking image of Jesus Christ dressed in a long white robe, holding a lantern in one hand, and knocking on a door that is covered in weeds and overgrowth. The painting is based on the biblical passage from the Book of Revelation, chapter 3, verse 20: \\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\" The painting, which currently resides in Keble College, Oxford, stunningly illustrates Christ as a gentle savior offering spiritual comfort and guidance to the viewer. Another notable painting of William Holman Hunt is \\"The Scapegoat\\" (1854-56). This piece visually represents the Jewish religious ritual described in the Book of Leviticus, where a goat would be sent into the wilderness to \\"bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited.\\" The concept of the scapegoat is used symbolically in various other instances throughout history and literature, representing the idea of one individual taking on the blame and guilt of others. In \\"The Scapegoat,\\" the solitary animal is depicted standing on a desolate and unreceptive landscape near the Dead Sea, illustrating its symbolic exile as it carries the sins of the community. The vivid colors and astounding level of detail in both the goat and the surrounding environment are characteristic of Hunt's commitment to the Pre-Raphaelite movement's principles. Throughout his extended career, Hunt traveled frequently, moving between England and the Middle East. He sought to capture authentic settings and details in his art, driven by a relentless dedication to truth and accuracy. While his works are deeply rooted in religious themes, the Pre-Raphaelite vision that shone through vividly portrayed a naturalism and vibrancy that set them apart from their contemporaries. William Holman Hunt passed away on September 7, 1910, leaving behind not only these two iconic paintings but a rich and meaningful portfolio that has inspired and captivated art enthusiasts from around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Cristiano Ronaldo brought the house down with another one-man show at the Santiago Bernabeu and there was even some first-half theatre as he dived for a penalty, which of course he converted in Real’s 3-0 win over Celta. The Real Madrid striker has now scored 200 league goals in 178 games; has netted more hat-tricks, 23 in the league, than any player in La Liga history; and is on a run of scoring in his last 17 home league matches. He is now scoring at a rate nearly two goals a game in the league – 23 in 13 matches. It would be churlish to dwell to long on the nature of the first goal but a dive is a dive even when it’s Ronaldo. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's big match stats: Real Madrid 3-0 Celta Vigo. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his clinical hat-trick that sent records tumbling during a 3-0 victory at the Bernabeu. The 29-year-old forward celebrates with team-mates Sergio Ramos (left), Karim Benzema, Dani Carvajal and Gareth Bale (right) Ronaldo took to Instagram after the game to celebrate his hat-trick with Real Madrid team-mate Pepe (right) Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Rodriguez (Arbeloa 53mins), Illarramendi, Kroos; Bale, Benzema (Coentrao 81'), Ronaldo (Hernandez 85') Booked: Rodriguez, Carvajal, Arbeloa, Illarramendi.

Booked: Cabral, Jonny, Nolito, Hernandez. Full-back Jonny Castro applied the slightest of touches to Ronaldo’s back as they both chased a Marcelo cross. There was no push from the defender but as the ball went beyond Ronaldo he dropped to the turf and referee Alberto Undiano pointed to the spot.The full-back was booked, as was forward Nolito, as Celta players surrounded the referee. Ronaldo coolly dispatched the spot-kick. It was his seventh penalty of the season. The only other player to score as many spot-kicks at this stage of the campaign was current Southampton manager Ronald Koeman in his Barcelona days. His first goal might have been unjust but it was only fair that Real went in at half time with the advantage having dominated the first 45 minutes. Celta Vigo had named the same team that beat Barcelona 1-0 a month ago but were under pressure from the start. Real should have taken the lead when Ronaldo headed goalwards, Celta Vigo keeper Sergio Alvarez pushed the ball out to Ramos, and he blasted wide from four yards out. Then Ronaldo had the ball taken off of his toe by full-back Jonny just as he was going to convert James Rodriguez’ cross and Gareth Bale joined the fun cutting in from the right but shooting straight at Alvarez. Ronaldo then bicycle-kicked onto the roof of the net with what would have been a sensational way to break the deadlock even by his standards. Alvarez pushed a Ronaldo shot around the post after the forward ran onto a long ball forward from Marcelo, and the keeper then held a shot from Rodriguez after he’d connected with a Ronaldo cross.

The 29-year-old Portuguese forward celebrates his opening strike with Welsh team-mate Bale (right) VIDEO Having Ronaldo is a bonus after bicentennial goal - Ancelotti. Just as it seemed Celta might reach half-time unscathed Undiano pointed to the spot after Jonny touched Ronaldo and the striker broke the deadlock. He got his second goal on 64 minutes after a wall-pass with Toni Kross and fine finish past Alvaraz. Ten minutes from time he completed his hat-trick with a left-foot finish from Marcelo’s cross. He hobbled off with five minutes left with an ankle knock and Rodriguez also went down with a calf injury and was immediately replaced by Arbeloa. Madrid will now wait anxiously for test results on both players – they are already without Luka Modric for the next two and a half months. Only injuries can derail this Ronaldo-inspired Madrid team. If they win in the week against Ludogorets in the Champions League and against Almeria next weekend they will go to the World Club Championship having won their last 20 matches. Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez went down injured early in the second half before being substituted. Real forward Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his second of the evening in what turned into a conclusive win at the Bernabeu. And he celebrated his hat-trick with team-mate Marcelo before being substituted in the closing stages of the match.

Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several... The most important factor in changing the speed of light is to transform .

Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.

Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [ka:l 'nelsn]; 9 June 1865 - 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor but musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. Nielsen was born the seventh of twelve children to a poor peasant family in 1865 at Sortelung near Norre Lyndelse, south of Odense on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jorgensen, was a house painter and traditional musician who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography Min Fynske Barndom (My Childhood on Funen). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837-1881), was a talented musician. Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \\"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin\\". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense. Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 ore and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances. What were his parents names?","completion":"Carl Nielsen's parents were Niels Jørgensen and Maren Kirstine Hansen.

Article: “His face was buried in the mattress of the stretcher,” lawyer Tim Edwards told NBC News Monday. “There was a strap over the back of his head so he couldn’t move his head. His hands and feet were hogtied so he couldn’t move those, either.” Goode was “intoxicated” after he and four friends took something in the parking lot before the concert began said Edwards, who declined to comment on what they may have used. “That’ll be determined by the toxicology screen,” he added. “Whatever was ingested, it was done by all five of them.” The chemical engineer “got paranoid” and left the concert site even before the gig began. He climbed out of his wife’s car and was “in a field running in circles,” Edwards said. “There was no one around him.” Cops saw him “running from the area acting strange and not cooperative,” Lt. Mark E. Little from the Southaven, Mississippi, Police Dept. said in a statement. “Officers attempted to detain the subject who began to resist and run from them again,” Little added. “On our initial investigation we learned that the subject had allegedly taken some LSD in a parking lot before a concert.” Little said officers were waiting on the results of an autopsy that was performed Monday morning which will include toxicology reports. Edwards said that Goode had asthma but \\"it was controlled\\" through his use of an inhaler. \\"If it played a part [in his death], we don’t know,\\" the lawyer added. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video SOUTHAVEN, Miss. -- An investigation is underway to get more details into how a man died in the 3400 block of Goodman Road. Troy Goode is dead, and his family is trying to get to the bottom of what happened. Tim Edwards, with Ballin, Ballin & Fishman P.C, is the family's attorney. Edwards said Goode and his wife were leaving the Widespread Panic concert at Snowden Grove Amphitheater as it began. \\"He was under the influence and so the wife began to drive them home,\\" Edwards told WREG. At some point on Goodman Road Edwards said Goode got out of the car and began running around. Southaven Police said they were called to a shopping complex on Goodman around 7:45 p.m. on Saturday. Police say they \\"attempted to detain the subject who began to resist and run from them again. He was eventually restrained by Officers and transferred to an awaiting ambulance to be transported to the hospital.\\" \\"They showed up in force and subdued him,\\" Edwards said. \\"They hogtied and put his face down on the stretcher.\\" Edwards claimed a witness heard Goode scream that he could not breathe. \\"The police took him off and next thing that we know he was a Baptist Hospital,\\" Edwards said. Police say they were told Goode may have taken LSD in the parking lot before the concert began. Goode's mother got the call that he died around 11:00 p.m. Saturday night. \\"The family as you might expect is grieving, and they are not irrational at all, but they want answers. They want to know why Troy died,\\" Edwards explained. WREG started questioning Southaven Police about the events that took place before Goode's death, but a department spokesperson said they were not commenting or releasing any more information Sunday evening. Goode's body is being taken to Jackson, Mississippi for an autopsy. \\"I'm not in the position right now pointing fingers because I don't know the cause of death,\\" Edwards said.

Solve this math problem Solve 64*k + 747 + 845 - 331 = -147 for k.","completion":"To solve this equation for k, we will follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms. 2. Isolate the term containing k. 3. Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k (which is 64). Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms First, let's add and subtract the constant terms on the left-hand side of the equation: 64*k + (747 + 845 - 331) = -147 Now we can calculate the result of the addition and subtraction: 747 + 845 = 1592 1592 - 331 = 1261 So, the simplified equation becomes: 64*k + 1261 = -147 Step 2: Isolate the term containing k Now, let's isolate the term containing k by subtracting 1261 from both sides of the equation: 64*k + 1261 - 1261 = -147 - 1261 This simplifies to: 64*k = -1408 Step 3: Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k (64) Finally, we will solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by 64: 64*k / 64 = -1408 / 64 This simplifies to: k = -22 So the solution for the given equation is k = -22."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. Question: \\"How long has Alan Gross maintained his innocence?\\" Response: \\"15 years\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The article mentions that Alan Gross was jailed in December 2009 and that he has maintained his innocence since then.

Still, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin. His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes. It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well. Can they tell that his hair has been unwashed for days? That his clothes are the same ones he's worn for more than a week? It doesn't matter.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Along with Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, who altered and diluted the interior features of the house he commissioned in 1967? The commission for the brand new house of Knightshayes Court was obtained from Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1867 and the foundation stone was laid in 1869. By 1874, the building was still incomplete, owing to ongoing difficulties with Heathcoat-Amory, who objected to many of Burges's designs on the grounds of cost and of style. Although work had begun on the interior, the turbulent relationship between architect and client led to Burges's sacking in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace. Nevertheless, Knightshayes Court remains the only example of a medium-sized Burges country house, built in a standard Victorian arrangement. Early French Gothic in style, it follows a standard neo-Tudor plan of a large central block with projecting gables. The tower Burges planned was never built. The interior was to have been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.Since the house passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of restoration and re-creation have been undertaken and a number of pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.

No; The given statement, \\"Destination marketing organizations are often called travel, convention, visitors, or tourism bureaux, welcome centers, information centers, and more.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question, \\"how many cubes are in the US?\\" The question is asking for a count or a number of cubes in the US. It is unclear whether the question refers to a specific type of cube (e.g., Rubik's cubes, ice cubes, etc.) or is asking in a more general sense. Regardless, the information provided in the answer about destination marketing organizations is not relevant to any interpretation of the question. The response should address the topic of cubes in the US rather than discussing unrelated information. In order to provide a relevant answer to the question, one would need to first clarify what type of cube is being referred to. For example, if the question is about Rubik's cubes, one could attempt to research and estimate the number of Rubik's cubes in the United States, taking into consideration sales data, market penetration, and other factors. This research task would be difficult due to the nature of the information required. Similarly, if the question is about ice cubes, one could research data related to the production and consumption of ice by the US population or other ice-cube-related statistics. However, providing an exact number would still be a challenging task due to the wide range of data sources and variables involved.

Write a summary based on this article: Why it matters: Trump has tweeted in the past that he thinks global warming is a hoax, but that was in 2012 and he has not focused on the topic much at all in his Twitter activity as president. This tweet shows he's still openly mocking mainstream climate change science, even without directly questioning it. President Trump mocked the idea of global warming in a tweet Thursday, making one of his first (if not the first) such public comments on the topic since entering the White House almost a year ago. Fast facts: Most scientists agree human activity, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels, has been the primary contributor to Earth's aggregate temperature going up this past century. That does not mean, though, that freezing cold weather, like the East Coast is experiencing right now, won't happen in the future in many parts of the world. Climate change science is much more complicated than that, but citing cold weather is still a favorite line of politicians and others who doubt climate change is happening. Sen. James Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma, threw a snowball on the Senate floor in February 2015 to mock global warming. One level deeper: Trump's tweet was also mocking the Paris climate deal, a global accord virtually every country in the world except the United States supports. It calls on countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but as it stands the commitments wouldn't cut emissions to the levels most scientists say is needed. America's commitment under President Obama was actually relatively moderate -- up to 28% cut in such emissions by 2025 based on 2005 levels, but the Trump administration pointed to conservative groups' studies showing it could cripple the U.S. industrial economy while other countries, notably China, were called on to do less. Between the lines: The Trump administration released without political influence a statutorily required report earlier this year confirming in great depth that human activity is driving climate change. Trump's tweets get a lot of attention, but make sure to also watch what the administration does or doesn't do on this issue. The bottom line: Words matter, and so do the president's tweets. His perspective on this issue is influencing his most ardent followers, a new poll suggests. A survey released in October from George Mason University found that just 21% of conservative Republicans think global warming is mostly human-caused, a decrease of nine points since earlier this year. The semantics around climate change, or global warming, are almost as divisive as the science itself. Global warming was the default term up until the last decade or so, when climate change became more popular among those urging action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That shift was partly to respond to comments like Trump made Thursday by clarifying that a higher global aggregate temperature does not mean the entire planet would be getting universally warmer. ||||| U.S. reconnaissance satellites have spotted Chinese ships selling oil to North Korean vessels on the West Sea around 30 times since October. According to South Korean government sources, the satellites have pictured large Chinese and North Korean ships illegally trading in oil in a part of the West Sea closer to China than South Korea. The satellite pictures even show the names of the ships. A government source said, \\"We need to focus on the fact that the illicit trade started after a UN Security Council resolution in September drastically capped North Korea's imports of refined petroleum products.\\" The U.S. Treasury Department placed six North Korean shipping and trading companies and 20 of their ships on sanctions list on Nov. 21, when it published spy satellite images taken on Oct. 19 showing a ship named Ryesonggang 1 connected to a Chinese vessel. |||||","completion":"President Trump recently mocked the concept of global warming in a tweet, highlighting his continued skepticism towards mainstream climate change science. This marks one of his first public comments on the subject since entering the White House. The majority of scientists agree that human activity, predominantly from burning fossil fuels, has been the primary cause of the rise in Earth's aggregate temperature during the past century. However, this does not rule out the occurrence of cold weather events similar to the one currently experienced by the US East Coast. Trump's tweet further criticizes the Paris climate agreement, which the US, under his administration, has refused to support. During Trump's time as President, his administration published a report that detailed how human activity is indeed the driving force behind climate change. While his tweets receive ample attention, it is crucial to observe how the administration handles the climate change issue through policy decisions. The effects of Trump's viewpoint on global warming cannot be underestimated, as it influences his supporters. A George Mason University poll found that only 21% of conservative Republicans believe global warming is predominantly human-caused, a decline of nine points from earlier in 2017. The terms \\"climate change\\" and \\"global warming\\" have become almost as divisive as the science itself. Although \\"global warming\\" was the default phrase in the past, \\"climate change\\" has become more prevalent amongst those advocating for greenhouse gas emission cuts. This terminological change aims to clarify that a higher global aggregate temperature does not necessarily mean uniform warming across the entire planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trust is hard to build if people don't think you are honest. If you say things to either get your way or to please others, pretty soon people will catch on. Get to know your thoughts and feelings and communicate them to others in a respectful way. Make your actions and words match. If you're going to be late or miss something, let the person know. Don't say you'll maybe be there if you can't make it. Be honest and genuine about your wants, likes, and dislikes and communicate them. For example, don't say you want to eat Chinese food to please your friend, then complain about not eating what you want. If you back out of plans last minute, chances are people won't trust you to do things or won't feel like they can count on you. If you say you'll be somewhere, be there. If you say you'll help your friend, help your friend. Once people see you as reliable, they will begin to trust you and count on you. For example, if someone proposes plans, try not to waver on them too long. You might fear committing to plans, but show that you're reliable and say either yes or no. . Respect goes a long way in building and maintaining trusting friendships. Treat people with dignity and as equals to yourself. How you treat others shows the kind of person you are and whether you're deserving of people's trust. For example, listen when people speak without speaking over them. Don't make everything about you. If you're known as a gossip or someone who spreads rumors, chances are nobody will trust you. Drop this habit and learn to speak to people and about people differently. If you're not sure about something, ask the person directly instead of spreading a rumor. People want to know that you will treat them well and not say mean things about them to others. People notice when you look out for other people and offer to help. Treat people you know and don't know with kindness. Be polite and show up for your friends when they need you. For example, ask a friend if they need help moving or if they need a hug after a difficult day. Being a friend to someone who's in need can show that you're a worthwhile and trustworthy friend. Being vulnerable is an important part of friendship. By telling your friends your secrets, insecurities, and deepest thoughts, you are showing them that you trust them. In return, they may share their most intimate thoughts with you. It can be hard to open up at first. Start small. Talk about things that are important to you. When the time is right, share more about yourself. It is important that you do not judge or laugh at your friends when they open up to you. Good friends are nonjudgmental when their friend shares something important to them. Summary:","completion":"To build trust, be honest and genuine in your communication, making sure your actions and words match. Be punctual and reliable, demonstrating your commitment to plans and promises. Treat others with respect and dignity, listen to them without interrupting, and avoid gossiping or spreading rumors. Show kindness, offer help, and support your friends during difficult times. Be open and vulnerable by sharing your feelings, secrets, and thoughts, fostering deeper connections.

However, she was granted a 10-day stay of execution - which was only given after she said her heart-wrenching final goodbyes to her mother, Shole Pakravan. In her last attempt to save her daughter's life, Pakravan is now begging the Iranian government to show mercy and spare Reyhaneh from the gallows. In a remarkable demonstration of a mother's love, Shole has gone as far as stating that she wishes she could be the one executed in her daughter's stead.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but the focus of prospecting should not be making sales. Your focus must be on establishing a relationship with as many prospects as possible. Opening the relationship comes first. Once you make contact with a prospect, you need to convince him or her to schedule an appointment or listen to your sales pitch. Sales are important, of course, and you should go into each dialogue with the goal of selling your product or service. Even if you do not make the sale, though, you should still seek to keep the relationship open. That prospect may need your product or service later, and if you continue to touch base, he or she may think of you before contacting anyone else when the time comes. Prospects typically respond better when they feel they are being served rather than sold to. Feedback lets your prospects know that you are interested in their needs and wants. Stay engaged through social media. Post frequent updates to your blog and social media pages, and respond to inquiries and comments made through those sources. Send surveys. Prospects are generally more willing to respond to short surveys, but they may respond to a long survey if there is a reward or the chance of a reward at the end. For instance, filling out a survey may enter the prospect in a drawing for cash or a gift card. Regardless of the length, though, sending surveys sends the message that you want to know how you can improve to meet customer needs. Even if your prospect is actually a large company instead of an individual, you will probably speak with the same individual at the company each time you call or write. Establishing a positive relationship with your contact at the company is important. At minimum, you need to know his or her name and keep your conversations both friendly and professional. If necessary, take notes after each conversation with your contact so that you can pick up where you left off with the next call. The contact you establish a relationship with may not make the final decision, but he or she will have some input. Creating a favorable opinion with your initial contact will improve your chances of a receiving a positive recommendation. Once you've started a relationship with a prospect, you need to nurture that relationship so that it continues to grow. The idea is to eventually convert your prospects into loyal customers. Follow up with each prospect on a regular basis. Send \\"thank you\\" notes and e-mails. Pass along surveys and copies of your newsletter. Touch base with those who have bought from you in the past to find out how satisfied they are with your product or service.","completion":"The primary focus of prospecting should be on establishing and nurturing relationships with as many prospects as possible, rather than solely making sales, as this approach can lead to more loyal customers and long-term business connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (1). heat energy (2). direct energy (3). depletion of light (4). inspection of light (5). flow of electrons (6). refraction of light (7). optical illusions (8). The area was once underwater The answer is:","completion":"(6). refraction of light Reasoning: Given Fact 1: Glass causes refraction of light. Given Fact 2: Mirrors are plate glass. Given these two facts, we can deduce that mirrors also cause refraction of light. Refraction occurs when light waves pass through one medium to another and change direction due to the different speeds of light in the two media. Mirrors are made of plate glass that has a reflective coating (usually silver, aluminum, or other metals) applied to the back. When light enters the glass, some of it is refracted and continues through the glass medium. The majority of the light, however, gets reflected off the reflective coating, forming the mirror's image. The refraction of light in the mirror is not as obvious as in a transparent medium, such as water, due to the reflective coating behind the glass. However, since mirrors are made from plate glass, they still cause refraction of light, as indicated in Fact 1. The other options are incorrect because: (1). heat energy - Mirrors do not generate or cause heat energy themselves. They simply reflect and refract light. (2). direct energy - Mirrors do not create or distribute energy; they reflect and refract light. (3). depletion of light - Mirrors do not deplete light but reflect and refract it. (4). inspection of light - Mirrors do not inspect light but reflect and refract it. (5). flow of electrons - Mirrors do not influence the flow of electrons, as their operation is based on the reflection and refraction of light. (7). optical illusions - Optical illusions can be created using mirrors, but it is not the sole cause or purpose of mirrors. (8).

He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Her father Tom (Sam Robards) has climbed Mount Everest so it runs in the family. Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her.

Negative Movie Review: \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" As an avid moviegoer, I cherish the excitement of immersing myself in a film that transports me to another world, one filled with enchanting characters, captivating storylines, and unforgettable visuals. Unfortunately, my experience with \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" left me yearning for the magic of cinematic storytelling that was so painfully absent from this film. From the outset, it was apparent that the film's plot lacked originality—a glaring issue that further unraveled as the story progressed. The movie was riddled with tropes, clichés, and scenes left me feeling bewildered by their inclusion, owing to their rather hackneyed nature. This absence of a distinctive narrative left a lingering sense of lost opportunity; a story filled with unexplored potential. Moreover, the characters in \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" were tragically underdeveloped, making it nearly impossible for viewers to form any emotional bond or invest in their stories. A lack of depth and complexity reduced the film to a shallow portrayal of cardboard cutouts parading across the screen, with dialogue that was often stilted and cringe-worthy. To make matters worse, any semblance of chemistry between the characters was glaringly absent, resulting in scenes that lacked emotion and genuine interaction. While a film's visual effects and cinematography can often redeem a weak plot and characters, \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" was unable to salvage itself through these means either. The visuals were unimaginative and lackluster, often leaning on CGI as a crutch to distract from the dull cinematography. Consequently, the film felt like a relic of a bygone era, rather than an innovative and exciting work of contemporary cinema. As if the weak story, characters and visuals weren't enough, the film's pacing was an exercise in frustration, ambling between tediously slow scenes to sudden, jarring jumps in the narrative. This erratic pacing made it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the film, serving only to underscore the fact that the end product was, regrettably, a disjointed mess. In conclusion, \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" failed to deliver the engaging and nuanced storytelling one would expect from cinema today. The uninspired plot, one-dimensional characters, bland visuals, and uneven pacing culminated in a movie that was ultimately forgettable. In an age where films can be both thought-provoking and visually stunning, this film missed the mark by a long shot. I would recommend steering clear of \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" and seeking out movies that truly exemplify the captivating power of a well-told story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: You can create a great deal of steam in your bathroom if you turn on your shower as hot as it will go and close the door. To fill the room, you’ll want to wait at least 10 minutes so the steam has time to build. Once there is plenty of steam in the bathroom, you can set the page down so the steam can help relax its fibers. Make sure that it’s not too close to the shower, though, because you don’t want any moisture to develop on the paper. Check that it isn’t folded or creased in any areas either. Wherever you plan to set the paper down, it’s a good idea to lay down a clean towel first. It will absorb any moisture that might be on the surface from the steam, so you don’t have to worry about the paper getting too wet. In order for the steam to help the paper release the wrinkles, you’ll need to keep it in the bathroom for approximately 10 minutes. If the page is severely wrinkled, you may want to give it extra time -- but check on it every so often to ensure that it’s not absorbing too much moisture. After the paper has been steamed, remove it from the bathroom, and place it on another flat surface. While the steam may have helped release some of the wrinkles, you should use your hand to press over it again while the paper is still relaxed from the steam. Be gentle, though, because you don’t want to tear or damage the page. You may want to cover your hand in a clean hand towel before smoothing the paper. That will help protect it from any dirt, oils, or other debris that might be on your skin. Even if you manage to smooth most of the wrinkles out of the paper, you may want to place the paper under a heavy weight for several hours to a day in order to further press it. Summary:","completion":"The text describes a method of using steam to relax the fibers of a piece of paper, potentially removing wrinkles and creases. The process begins with running a hot shower in a closed bathroom, generating steam. After a buildup of about 10 minutes, the paper can be placed in the steamy room on a towel to absorb any surface moisture. The distance from the shower should be enough to avoid any moisture from developing on the paper. It is also advised to ensure the paper is not folded or creased. Following an approximate 10-minute exposure to the steam (possibly longer for heavily wrinkled paper), the paper should be frequently checked so it doesn't absorb too much moisture. Post-steam treatment, the paper should be gently pressed while it is still relaxed from the steam, preferably with a clean hand towel, to prevent any damage or tear. Finally, for the best results, the paper should be placed under a heavy weight for several hours to a day. This process aids in removing most of the wrinkles from the paper, ensuring it stays smooth and clean."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA consists of 55 national association members. - The UEFA Champions League is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champion (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of each UEFA national association. The final of the 201213 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The UEFA Champions League Anthem , officially titled simply as \`\` Champions League '' , is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League , written by English composer Tony Britten in 1992 . - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services. What is the relationship between 'uefa champions league anthem' and 'national anthem'? A:","completion":"The relationship between the 'UEFA Champions League Anthem' and a 'national anthem' is that both are musical compositions associated with specific organizations or entities.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on. She is exploring the outer rims of the galaxy when she discovers two new planets that may be suitable. The atmospheric makeup of these planets is very similar to Pam's current home. After running a quick diagnostic, the only difference that Pam sees is that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A. and a hint : The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Please answer this question : Which planet has more less inside its atmosphere?","completion":"Between the two planets discovered by Pam during her mission, planet A has less carbon dioxide in its atmosphere compared to planet B. This significant detail can play a crucial role in determining the suitability of these planets for human habitation. As mentioned in the hint, global warming and climate change are real and pressing concerns caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being the main culprit. Greenhouse gases, due to their molecular structure, are highly effective in trapping heat within the atmosphere. This leads to a rise in Earth's temperature and contributes to various adverse effects on the planet and human existence. Warming caused by greenhouse gases is responsible for the destruction or alteration of natural habitats and a decline in wildlife populations. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report suggesting a significant temperature increase between 1990 and 2100, it is crucial that human colonization considers the long-term consequences of adding carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere. With this in mind, planet A, with comparatively lower carbon dioxide levels in its atmosphere, would be a more promising option for human habitation. Given the urgency in mitigating the effects of global warming and preserving natural environments, selecting a planet with less atmospheric carbon dioxide would provide a better foundation for sustainable human settlement. However, Pam should also consider other factors before making a final decision, such as the availability of resources, geological stability, and potential habitability for humans and other life forms. Both planets should be thoroughly studied to ensure that the selected planet will meet the long-term needs of the settlers and minimize any negative impact on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Pre-Ordering School Lunches Steer Kids To Healthier Meal Choices Along the lines of advice to avoid grocery shopping when you’re hungry, new research concludes that children who electronically pre-order their lunch are more likely to make healthier meal choices than students who pick and choose as they make their way through the cafeteria line. The four-week study looked at the choices made by 272 students in grades 1 to 5 in two schools in upstate New York. When the students pre-ordered their lunches, 29% were more likely to pick a healthier entrée compared to 15% when the option to pre-order was unavailable. When students chose their entrée in the lunch line, they were 48% less likely to make a healthy choice and 21% more likely to chose a less healthy entrée. (MORE: Stricter School Lunch Standards Lead To Lighter Kids) In the study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers from Cornell University suggest that preordering lunch entrées could prevent distractions like sights and smells that could prompt kids to make hasty and potentially unhealthy choices when picking their meals. Anti-obesity advocates and public health experts continually look for ways to measurably change the food environments for children in schools. In January 2012 the U.S. Department of Agriculture revised school meal guidelines and required more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and stricter calorie limits. The stricter guidelines were met with mixed reviews, with some children complaining the calorie limits didn’t fill them up. In response, the USDA allowed the schools more flexibility in meat and grain servings. But there’s still debate about the restrictions. As school lunch nutritional standards continue evolving, research is showing that having healthier options in school cafeterias could effectively curb weight gain and cravings for unhealthy treats. (MORE: More Food for Hungry Students: USDA Tweaks School Meals) “I think that some of the great things that happened with updating the school meal standards was that there were more fruits and vegetables,” says Jessica Donze Black, project director for The Pew Charitable Trusts Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project. Black is unaffiliated with the study. “We all recognize that kids don’t get enough fruits and vegetables and certainly giving them more is a good thing. When we look at the schools that have been successful with that, where the kids are really eating more fruits and vegetables, there are some strategies that are really working.” Some schools have already seen success, and Black says some of the most successful and sustainable changes in lunchroom fare and eating habits have been among schools involving students in the menu decision-making process. ”Giving children an opportunity to taste-test allows them to provide feedback and an opportunity to show their preferences,” says Black. It helps also if schools are rolling the lunch room changes out over time; getting used to healthier options doesn’t happen overnight. “A lot of those schools who have done well with integrating the foods will say they started the process a couple of years ago,” says Black. (MORE: Cutting Out Soda Curbs Children’s Weight Gain, Studies Show) While pre-ordering meals may be a strategy for steering kids toward healthier choices, Black says that the overall food environment makes a greater difference in whether kids choose healthy food options. “It is not just what is in the meals, but what’s in the rest of the school food environment. What’s in the a la carte line, what’s in the vending machine, what’s in the school’s store. It’s important all those foods are also healthy so we are not making fruits and vegetables compete with cookies and cakes when it comes to students’ tastes,” she says. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project’s recent health impact assessment (HIA) showed that revising national nutrition standards for snacks and drinks sold in schools not only helps students maintain a good weight but also benefits school budgets by increasing revenue for school food services. Without unhealthy snacks, the research found students are more likely to buy school meals. “This is also better for school budgets because they get reimbursements from the federal governments for all those meals. It’s a win-win,” says Black. As researchers continue to pinpoint the most successful strategies for healthier students — and schools continue to implement them — there’s hope that that now and in the future children’s weight and energy will reach healthy levels.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question. What is the ingredient usually used to turn rice or curry yellow","completion":"The ingredient typically used to turn rice or curry yellow is turmeric (Curcuma longa). Turmeric is a spice obtained from the rhizomes or roots of the turmeric plant, which is a member of the ginger family. It is native to Southeast Asia and has been widely used in various cuisines for centuries, particularly in Indian, Thai, and Middle Eastern dishes. Turmeric is well-known for its vibrant yellow color, which in fact comes from a naturally occurring chemical compound called curcumin. Curcumin is a pigment that imparts the characteristic yellow hue to dishes, including rice and curry, when it is used in small quantities. Its color also makes it a popular choice for natural food coloring. When used in rice dishes, turmeric adds not only a beautiful shade of yellow but also a subtle earthy and slightly bitter flavor. Many famous rice dishes, such as Indian Biryani or Spanish paella, use turmeric for color and taste. Turmeric can also be found in various curry recipes, either as a whole root or in ground form, typically combined with other spices like cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The spice blend gives curries their rich depth of flavor and color. To use turmeric in rice or curry, the following steps are usually followed: 1. Preparing the spice: If using whole turmeric root, wash it thoroughly and peel its outer skin. Use a grater or mortar and pestle to grate or crush it into a smooth paste. If using ground turmeric, measure out the required amount according to your recipe. 2. Preparing the dish: In a pan or pot over medium heat, sauté chopped onions, garlic, and any other aromatics you may be using. Then, add the turmeric and other spices, stirring well to combine. This process, known as \\"blooming,\\" helps release the aroma and flavor of the turmeric and spices. 3. Adding the main ingredients: If making rice, add the washed rice to the pan, stirring it to ensure that every grain is coated in the turmeric-infused oil. If making curry, add your choice of protein (such as chicken, beef, or tofu) or vegetables, cooking until they are well-coated in the spice mix. 4. Creating the sauce or cooking the rice: Add liquids depending on the dish. For curry, this may include crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, or stock. For rice, use an appropriate amount of water or stock depending on the type of rice you are using. Cook the dish according to the recipe instructions until the ingredients are well-cooked and the liquids are absorbed or thickened. Turmeric not only gives rice and curry dishes their signature yellow color, but it also offers various health benefits. Curcumin is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, it has been studied for its potential role in managing health conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. In conclusion, turmeric is the key ingredient used to give rice and curry dishes their appealing, distinctive yellow hue. Its unique color and flavor, along with its health benefits, have made it an essential spice in numerous cuisines worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does \\"Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"In what decade did film and literature help revive football in Britain?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s\\" provides the correct answer to the question, \\"In what decade did film and literature help revive football in Britain?.\\" The decade referred to in the statement is the 1990s. To elaborate, during the 1990s, football experienced a revival in Britain, which was significantly aided by the influence of film and literature. This period was marked by a change in the perception of the sport, transitioning from a primarily working-class pastime with a somewhat negative reputation due to hooliganism and violence in the 1980s, to a more socially inclusive and economically prosperous activity. Literature, including the publication mentioned in the statement, played an essential role in reflecting and influencing this transformation in British society. One example is the best-selling book \\"Fever Pitch\\" by Nick Hornby, published in 1992. This autobiographical work explored the life of a football fan, capturing the emotions and passion that the sport can generate in its supporters. Its success and popularity contributed to a shift in public attitudes towards the sport and its social value. Additionally, the world of film played an influential role in reviving football in Britain. Movies such as \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" (2002) and \\"The Damned United\\" (2009) portrayed various aspects of the sport and culture which help break down gender and class barriers. They showcased the tremendous impact football can have both on individual lives and larger communities, emphasizing its significance in British society. Moreover, the inauguration of the English Premier League in 1992 marked a turning point in the commercialization and globalization of football in Britain. The new league structure, lucrative broadcast deals, and influx of foreign talent contributed to the sport's growing popularity and appeal across various demographics. In conclusion, the statement does contain the correct answer to the question. Film and literature played a significant role in reviving football in Britain during the 1990s. The period was marked by changes in public perceptions and the sport's socio-economic status, attributable in part to the impact of these cultural mediums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry, (18 June 1769 - 12 August 1822), usually known as Lord Castlereagh, which is derived from his courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh, (UK: KAH-s@l-rey), was an Irish/British statesman. As British Foreign Secretary, from 1812 he was central to the management of the coalition that defeated Napoleon and was the principal British diplomat at the Congress of Vienna. Castlereagh was also leader of the British House of Commons in the Liverpool government from 1812 until his suicide in August 1822. Early in his career, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was involved in putting down the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and was instrumental in securing the passage of the Irish Act of Union of 1800. Stewart had recurring health problems throughout his childhood, and his family elected to send him to The Royal School, Armagh, rather than to England for his secondary education. At the encouragement of Charles Pratt, first Earl of Camden, who took a great interest in him and treated him as a grandson by blood, he later attended St. John's College, Cambridge (1786-87), where he applied himself with greater diligence than expected from an aristocrat and obtained first class in his last examinations. He left Cambridge due to an extended illness, and after returning to Ireland did not pursue further formal education. In 1790, Stewart was elected as a Member of the Irish Parliament for Down in one of the most expensive elections in Irish history. Though for a time he was associated with the Northern Whig Club, he entered the Irish House of Commons as an Independent. He ran on a platform supporting Whig principles of electoral reform and opposing the Irish policies of the British Government. But even from the outset of his career, he was a personal supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. Stewart was a lifelong advocate of Catholic concessions, though his position on the specific issue of Catholic Emancipation varied depending on his assessment of the potential repercussions on other policy priorities. When war with France forced British Government attention on Ireland as a possible place of French invasion, the Irish Volunteers, seen as a potential source of disaffection, were disbanded by Dublin Castle, and a reorganised Militia was created in 1793. Stewart enrolled as an officer, a matter of course for a young Protestant aristocrat, and served as Lieutenant Colonel under the command of his wife's uncle, Thomas Conolly. Between Stewart's attendance to his militia duties, his pursuit of cultural, family and political interests in London, two trips to the Continent (in 1791, when he visited revolutionary Paris, and 1792), and the courtship of his wife whom he married in 1794, his life during this period was not centred on the activities of the Irish House of Commons, where he was listened to with respect but where he was not yet an important player. He was also beginning to disappoint some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the French Revolution grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain. He became further inclined to support not only Pitt personally but the British Government, even when he did not approve of a specific line taken in Irish policy. In 1794, partly as a result of the promotion of Stewart's interests by his Camden connections, he was offered the Government-controlled seat of Tregony in Cornwall, where he was elected to the British House of Commons on a similar platform of reform principles and support for Pitt, on whose side he sat in Westminster. In 1796, he transferred to a seat for the Suffolk constituency of Orford, which was in the interest of his mother's family, the Seymour-Conways (Marquess of Hertford). What did he do after returning to Ireland?","completion":"After returning to Ireland, Lord Castlereagh did not pursue further formal education.

Question: \\"How many 60 minute periods every day is Mass transit open?\\" Context: \\"Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Mass transit in New York City, as mentioned in the context, operates 24 hours a day. To determine how many 60-minute periods there are within a day, we need to know how many minutes are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, and each hour consists of 60 minutes. To calculate the number of 60-minute periods in a day, we can simply multiply the number of hours in a day (24) by the number of minutes in an hour (60): 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes/day Now, to find the number of 60-minute periods, also known as \\"hourly slots\\" or simply \\"hours\\" within a day, we can then divide the total number of minutes in a day (1440) by the number of minutes in each period (60): 1440 minutes/day ÷ 60 minutes/period = 24 periods/day Thus, there are 24 60-minute periods each day during which mass transit in New York City is open and operational. The city's extensive mass transit system serves its large and diverse population, playing a critical role in daily commutes for work, school, and various other activities. The New York City mass transit system includes subways, buses, regional railways, and ferries, working together to support the transportation needs of the nation's largest metropolitan area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With the demand for medications continually increasing, the production and distribution of essential drugs have been insufficient to meet the needs of patients globally. In an unprecedented and critical move, former President Barack Obama is reported to have ordered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take necessary measures to address and alleviate the situation. The Scope and Impact of Drug Shortages The drug shortages have had wide-ranging effects across the nation, impacting numerous health care facilities, patients, medical professionals, and insurance providers. Evidence indicates that the problem affects drugs intended for various health issues, including cancer treatment, cardiac care, infectious diseases, neurological disorders, and anesthesia. This shortage has substantially restricted the availability of life-saving medications in hospitals and outpatient departments. Consequently, medical practitioners have been compelled to rely on alternative treatments that may not be as effective or face increased costs for acquiring the needed drugs from alternative sources. The Detrimental Effects on Patients and Providers The consequences of drug shortages have been particularly harmful for patients requiring immediate or specialized care. In certain cases, individuals have been forced to wait for long periods to receive vital medications or have their treatment plans altered due to the scarcity of necessary drugs. Furthermore, the increased pressure on healthcare providers to find alternative treatments and medication sources comes at a significant financial burden, which inevitably affects the institutions and individuals they serve. Obama's Call to FDA: Strategies to Address Drug Shortages Understanding the urgency of the situation, Obama ordered the FDA to implement crucial measures to stem the shortages and ensure appropriate medication availability across the nation. Among the key recommendations are: 1. Streamlining review processes: In an effort to enhance efficiency, the FDA will be asked to simplify and speed up its review and approval processes for new drug applications. This will facilitate the introduction of potential alternatives for medications in short supply, fostering competition amongst drug manufacturers and reducing the likelihood of unexpected shortages. 2. Strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing: In response to the acknowledgment that manufacturing issues contribute to drug shortages, Obama's directive also calls for the FDA to support the improvement of production techniques and infrastructure within the pharmaceutical industry. This will serve not only to alleviate current shortages but also to prevent future issues from arising. 3. Enhancing communication and collaboration: To ensure better management of drug supply, the FDA will be required to work closely with the drug manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. Fostering open communication channels will improve the industry's ability to anticipate and address potential shortages proactively. 4. Increasing transparency: Another key aspect of Obama's call to action involves the promotion of greater transparency among drug manufacturers. This includes mandatory notifications to the FDA by companies if they foresee shortages, allowing the FDA to act preemptively and source alternative medications for patients. 5. Encouraging drug stockpiling: Lastly, the FDA will investigate the feasibility of encouraging stockpiling of essential medications. This could mitigate the effects of unexpected manufacturing issues or increased demand, ensuring a more stable supply of necessary drugs. Conclusion President Obama's directive exemplifies his commitment to the health and well-being of citizens across the nation. By ordering the FDA to take proactive measures to address the drug shortage crisis, his administration took a decisive approach in ensuring the continuity and quality of care for every individual. Although long-term solutions to drug shortages may be challenging to establish, Obama's vital intervention demonstrates the importance of addressing this issue and serves as a crucial foundation for future improvements in the pharmaceutical industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

By Alex Greig PUBLISHED: 19:25 EST, 10 March 2014 | UPDATED: 22:49 EST, 10 March 2014 A Virginia family is campaigning to encourage a drug company to allow their sick little boy who is fighting for his life access to life-saving medicine. Josh Hardy, a seven-year-old cancer survivor, needs a drug called Brincidofovir, made by small North Carolina drug company Chimerex, to fight off a viral infection he developed after a recent bone marrow transplant. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but it has been administered to hundreds of other patients under 'compassionate use' allowances.","completion":"The Hardy family has been working tirelessly to petition the Chimerex pharmaceutical company and the FDA for their son's access to Brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral medication that doctors believe could save Josh Hardy's life. Despite their efforts, Chimerex initially denied the family's request, citing the need to focus on the drug's ongoing clinical trials and the potential risk of diverting resources away from the greater good. This decision led to a massive public outcry, as social media campaigns and petitions drew attention to the desperate situation facing Josh Hardy and his family. In response to the mounting public pressure, Chimerex reconsidered its position and ultimately agreed to allow Josh Hardy to participate in an expanded \\"compassionate use\\" program. This program would not only provide Josh with access to Brincidofovir, but it would also be expanded to include other critically ill patients who meet specific eligibility criteria. With this new agreement in place, Chimerex would be able to continue their clinical trials while also addressing the needs of those in immediate need of treatment. Josh Hardy began receiving the experimental treatment shortly afterward, facing a long and uncertain road to recovery. Under the watchful eyes of his medical team and the support of his family, friends, and an ever-growing community of supporters, Josh began to show signs of improvement. The viral infection that was attacking his body started to recede, and his doctors became increasingly optimistic about his prognosis. Over the subsequent months, Josh's recovery continued, and his story became a testament to the power of perseverance, public advocacy, and the potential benefits of compassionate use programs. The Chimerex pharmaceutical company, for its part, pledged to work closely with the FDA and other regulatory bodies to advance the clinical research and approval process for Brincidofovir, with a particular emphasis on ensuring broader access to the drug for patients in need. As Brincidofovir moves through the later stages of clinical trials and the FDA approval process, Josh Hardy's story serves as a powerful reminder that behind every experimental drug, there is a human face and a personal story. His fight for access to this life-saving medication highlights the critical importance of striking a balance between the urgency of individual patient needs and the careful, methodical process of drug development and approval. In doing so, the story sparked a broader public conversation and debate over the ethics and efficacy of the current compassionate use guidelines and the potential for reform in this crucial area of the healthcare system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jesse thought twice about their decision, which demonstrates their determination to analyze a situation diligently and thoroughly. They took into consideration all the relevant facts, indicating their commitment to making well-informed choices and weighing the consequences of their actions. A good planner is someone who meticulously assesses their options, contemplates various possible outcomes, and strategizes for potential difficulties that they may encounter. Jesse's approach to decision-making encompasses these qualities, as they sought to avoid making rash judgments without evaluating the entirety of the situation. It is important to acknowledge that even though Jesse is a good planner, they may still face unforeseen challenges or obstacles in their endeavors. The fact that they think carefully about their choices, however, is likely to leave them better-equipped to handle such situations. This proactive approach to problem-solving and commitment to understanding the potential implications of their decisions is an indication of a strong planner. In contrast, thoughtless and stupid individuals often make decisions impulsively, without taking the time to reflect on potential consequences or explore alternative options. They are not likely to consider relevant facts or weigh the pros and cons of their actions. It may lead them to poor decision-making, which can have negative repercussions on their personal or professional lives. A bad planner might have some semblance of a plan but could lack the foresight and attention to detail required to execute it effectively. They may neglect crucial aspects of a task or struggle to adapt when faced with unexpected challenges. Their lack of planning may also hinder their ability to achieve long-term goals. Through a careful examination of Jesse's approach to decision-making, it is clear that they do not exhibit the characteristics typically associated with being thoughtless and stupid or a bad planner. By considering all of the facts and taking the time to reflect on their choices, Jesse displays the hallmarks of a good planner who is dedicated to making informed decisions that align with their interests and goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The total number of deaths following British settlement in 1788 has long been debated, but many historians estimate it numbered tens of thousands. Researchers hope the map will help with education and creating monuments. The project includes details about the number of people killed at each site, which weapons were used, and who was responsible. The information was compiled over four years and corroborated through sources including settler diaries, newspaper reports, court records and letters. \\"For many Australians, this kind of information will come as a shock,\\" project author Prof Lyndall Ryan told the BBC. \\"Our ancestors were out there engaging in some pretty violent forms of behaviour.\\" More than 150 massacres affecting almost every Aboriginal clan took place between 1788 and 1872, compared with six recorded massacres of colonists during the same period. A massacre was defined as the indiscriminate killing of six or more undefended people, the study said. Prof Ryan said several violent events claimed more than 60 lives, while about 150 people were killed in one incident in Victoria's Gippsland region. Prof Ryan, a historian at Australia's University of Newcastle, said the team will document the country's west over the next two years.

Looking at this review, it is quite evident that the user has had a disappointing experience with the product or service being reviewed. They have mentioned three major issues: the product has stopped working, it does not back up automatically, and as a result, they have lost all their messages. These three points suggest that the product's functionality or features failed to meet the user's expectations or requirements, leading to a negative experience. Thus, if we were to rate the user's experience based on the issues reflected in the review, we might give it a score of 1, reflecting a least favorable experience. On the other hand, if we are evaluating the quality of the review itself, a few factors might need to be considered. In terms of clarity, the review is straightforward and quickly gets to the point. However, it lacks some crucial details that could have made it more helpful to both the product developers as well as potential buyers. For instance, the user has not mentioned which product they are referring to, the context of their usage, nor did they provide any specific scenarios about when or how the problems occurred. The absence of these kinds of details makes it less actionable for the developers to improve the product and less effective as a guide for potential customers trying to make a purchasing decision. Consequently, in terms of its usefulness as a review, it might be rated 2, indicating room for significant improvement.

Summarize this article: First impressions are usually formed within 30 seconds. The first thing an employer will notice is your physical appearance. Pick a wardrobe that communicates effort and professionalism. Research the company's dress code going into the interview. If you know anyone from the company, ask them what's appropriate. You can also call the company's Human Resource Department and ask what is recommended in terms of attire. If you're interviewing for a professional, managerial, or executive position you should always wear a suit. Have a few interview suits, preferably tailored to your body, on hand to choose from. If the attire is business casual, or if you're applying for a lower ranking position, a nice blouse with dress pants or a skirt is a good choice for women. Men can wear dress pants and a button down shirt and tie. If this is for a factory, construction, or other such job where you will get dirty, wear sensible attire to the interview, this includes steel-toed safety shoes and if it's a construction site, you'll need to wear a hard hat (not a bump hat) to get from the gate to the office. Do not forget footwear. Oftentimes, an outfit is great but shoes are tattered or worn. Invest in comfortable, work-appropriate shoes. Do not fret if you have to pay a little more. Remember, you will use these shoes often when you land a job. Avoid perfumes and other fragrances, which can appear tacky and put off interviewers. While accessories, like a nice belt or tasteful jewelry, can be a nice touch avoid anything overly flashy or distracting. If you wear make-up, stick to neutral shades of lipstick, eye-liner, and eye shadow. Your make-up should ideally enhance your existing facial features without overwhelming them. Never go into an interview without prior knowledge of the company. This conveys a lack of interest and respect on your part. Conduct thorough research in the days leading up to an interview. Know what skills the company values. Look at the career page on their website and pay close attention to the desired qualifications listed on their job postings. This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a given company and discover what aspects of your skill set and career history to emphasize. Read up on the latest news involving the company. Oftentimes, company websites have a section dedicated to press releases and news coverage. You can also search for the company's name in Google News. Research the company's mission and values. You'll want to make sure you come off as a good fit for the company's culture. There should be a section on the company's website with a mission statement. You can also follow the company on social media to get a sense of their ethos. Find out who your interviewer will be. Oftentimes, this is disclosed in the email asking you to come in for an interview. If not, you can politely request their name. Research the interviewer on LinkedIn and Twitter. This increases your chance of connecting and, in turn, landing the job. Concrete is better than abstract when it comes to wowing an interviewer. You should have a few solid anecdotes prepared that speak to your experience. People tend to remember stories easier than direct information. Therefore, telling a story rather than simply conveying your experience means you'll stand out in an interviewer's mind. Ask yourself, what are the skill sets this company is looking for? Write down a list of skills and, from there, try to come up with stories from past jobs, volunteer experiences, and internships that illustrate your proficiency with said skills. Have 2 to 3 anecdotes to choose from going in. Rehearse. Recite the stories to yourself to make sure you include all necessary information and don't slip up or stutter during the interview. You can always record yourself speaking and play back the recording to see where you need to improve. It's not uncommon for employers to scan the Twitter and Facebook accounts of potential employees. Make sure your social media presence is clean before going into an interview. Curse words do not reflect well on you as a potential employee. Make sure any obscenity is removed. A negative attitude can be a deterrent to employment and people often take to Twitter and Facebook to complain. Delete tweets or statues that air grievances about friends, family members, or businesses. If you want to err on the side of caution, you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook or Twitter profile the week before your interview. You can also change privacy settings so only certain posts are visible to the public.","completion":"First impressions in an interview are critical and are usually formed within 30 seconds. To make a good impression, dress professionally and in line with the company's dress code. Be well-groomed and avoid strong fragrances, flashy accessories, or overwhelming makeup. Research the company thoroughly before the interview, including its values, recent news, and desired skills. Prepare 2-3 anecdotes that demonstrate your relevant skills and practice telling these stories. Find out who your interviewer will be and research them on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter to increase your chances of connecting during the interview. Finally, ensure your own social media presence is clean and professional, removing any obscenities or complaints, and adjusting your privacy settings if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: The Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (abbreviated Acta Palaeontol. Pol.), has the ISSN number \\"1732-2421\\". What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"Numerous pieces of data can be extracted from the given sentence, demonstrating how rich even a solitary sentence can be in terms of information density. The data extracted falls into several categories, including details about journal identity, content focus, bibliographic referencing, and publication identification. 1. Publication Identification: The primary piece of data mentioned is the designation of the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN 1732-2421). The ISSN functions as an identifier for serial publications, similar to the role ISBNs play for individual books. It is unique to a particular serial, allowing for efficient cataloguing and retrieval in libraries and databases throughout the world. This number indicates that the Acta Palaeontologica Polonica is recorded in the global ISSN database, facilitating rapid identification and management. 2. Journal Identity: The name of the journal, \\"Acta Palaeontologica Polonica\\", is a central piece of data in the sentence. This tells us the name of the publication, crucial information for any further reference or study. It suggests that the journal is likely linked with Poland given the \\"Polonica\\" inclusion, indicating the origin or linguistic focus of the journal. 3. Abbreviation: The sentence provides the abbreviated title of the journal (\\"Acta Palaeontol. Pol.\\"), which can be used in bibliographic references where space is limited or to ensure quick recognition by readers familiar with the abbreviation. 4. Content Focus: The name of the journal suggests that its content primarily revolves around the science of Paleontology. The term \\"palaeontologica\\" points to this scientific discipline, indicating an academic focus on the history of life on Earth through the study of plant and animal fossils. 5. Language: Although the sentence does not directly provide this piece of data, we can infer that the language of the journal might be English because of the nomenclature and format used. Abbreviating the journal's title is a common practice in English academic publishing, and there is no direct reference to another language in the sentence. However, the word \\"Polonica\\" may suggest a link to Polish language or content, but this assumption requires further verification. In sum, the sentence may appear simple at first glance but reveals considerable information about the publication identity, regional origin, subject focus, abbreviated titling, and potentially the language of a widely recognised paleontological journal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Metrosideros is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines mostly found in the Pacific region in the Myrtaceae family. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek \\"metra\\" or \\"heartwood\\" and \\"sideron\\" or \\"iron\\". Perhaps the best-known species are the phutukawa (\\"M. excelsa\\"), northern rt (\\"M. robusta\\"), and southern rt (\\"M. umbellata\\") of New Zealand, and \\"hia lehua\\", (\\"M. polymorpha\\"), from the Hawaiian Islands. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Myrtaceae is the myrtle family, a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pohutukawa, the bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus all are members of this group. All species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \\"Buenos aires\\" can be translated as \\"fair winds\\" or \\"good airs\\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \\"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Corazón de Sudamérica\\" (\\"Heart of South America\\"). Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay is the smallest landlocked country in the Americas. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the myrtle family commonly known as tepú , trepú , or tepual . It is an evergreen tree or shrub that can attain a height of about seven metres . The plant is native to southern South America in the southern portions of Chile and Argentina and is a typical resident of very wet areas , especially peat bogs . Tepú has white flowers that emerge during the austral summer from January through March . The tree 's wood is used within its range as a firewood due to it high energy content . This species has often been placed in its own genus Tepualia , but recent works include it in Metrosideros \`\` WCSP '' . World Checklist of Selected Plant Families . . - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south.

Article: Image copyright iStock Image caption The gorillas are given diluted squash every day - though are unlikely to use straws It has emerged that Kumbuka, the gorilla that escaped from its enclosure at London Zoo, drank five litres (nine pints) of undiluted blackcurrant squash before being tranquillised. What impact would this have had on his health, asks Harry Low. The western lowland silverback left his den through an unlocked door and entered the zookeepers' enclosure, where he seized his chance to drink something sweet - lots of it. He would have been more familiar with the diluted version of the drink, which forms part of the gorillas' daily diet, according to a spokeswoman for the zoo, along with cold fruit tea and leafy greens such as cabbage and kale. They are also fed other fresh vegetables including broccoli, carrots and cucumber. Gorillas have quite large stomachs so this epic helping of concentrated squash could have caused severe stomach pains and diarrhoea, according to Prof Phyllis Lee, a primatologist at the University of Stirling. \\"Five litres is quite a lot for a gorilla to consume in one go but given a gorilla's manual dexterity, I would assume that some would have been spilled,\\" she says. \\"He must have found it and taken his opportunity, similar to how a four-year-old child would.\\" Lee added that she would expect the squash to affect the consistency of Kumbuka's poo rather than its colour - even in the case of blackcurrant - though she added that she had not studied the matter closely. Image copyright PA Image caption Kumbuka succeeded in opening the bottle but may have spilled some of its contents But what about the effect of the sugar? Might this have caused a surge of physical activity once the effect of the tranquilliser had worn off? Apparently not in this case. \\"Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about,\\" according to Prof David Field, who carried out a report into last week's incident. Had a human drunk five litres of undiluted squash, the results would have been similar, but possibly more extreme. It would be almost impossible for a human to take that much squash on, according to dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker. \\"I would imagine it would lead to a very upset tummy and disrupt the digestive tract,\\" she says. Diarrhoea and sickness would be the main symptoms, she suggests, though they would not last too long. \\"It wouldn't cause lasting damage - maybe you'd feel the effects for a day.\\" According to Phyllis Lee, Kumbuka's size - he weighs 29 stone (184kg) - would have helped him cope with his squash-drinking binge. There would have been no danger of overdosing on vitamin C, she says, and no damage to the teeth from just one episode of this kind. \\"That would only be caused by continually consuming sugary drinks.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Professor David Field, the zoological director at Londonzoo explained to BBC Radio 4's PM programme what Kumbuka did with his freedom.

As the first part of our investigation concludes, I’m keen to use this opportunity to clarify some things. The results of this initial investigation have established that the gorilla dens are sound and fit for purpose. For a Zoological Director running a zoo responsible for thousands of animals and hundreds of staff, this kind of reassurance matters. I can certainly tell you that there were no broken locks, Kumbuka did not smash any windows, he was never ‘on the loose’, and his normal gorilla posturing reported by visitors earlier in the day was unrelated to the incident. What I will tell you is what happened, according to those who were actually there. Kumbuka was called into his private night quarters for his dinner at around 5.10pm on Thursday 13th October. As a big silverback male with a matching appetite, he eats separately from the females - otherwise they wouldn’t get a look in. Unfortunately the door to his den had not been properly secured and a secondary security door had not yet been locked. We’ve since established that Kumbuka made an opportunistic escape from his unlocked den into the staff-only service corridor where a zookeeper was working. Thanks to the incredibly close bond and relationship shared by the zookeeper and Kumbuka, the zookeeper was able to continually reassure Kumbuka, talking to him calmly and in the same light-hearted tone he would always use, as he removed himself from the area. Staff raised the alarm that triggered our standard escape response, while Kumbuka briefly explored the zookeeper area next door to his den, where he opened and drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash. Kumbuka was immediately contained in the non-public area by quick-thinking zookeepers responding to the alarm, where he was tranquilised and moved back into his den. Video of Gorillas enjoy foraging for Autumn treats Any breach of our security protocols is incredibly serious, but the incident itself was less dramatic than some would have you believe. Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about. The professional responses of our zookeepers, our security teams and the emergency services was exemplary and thanks to the zookeepers’ strong relationship with Kumbuka they were able to reassure him during the incident. Now that the initial facts have been established, it’s our job to understand any contributing factors that allowed an experienced and highly trained zookeeper to make a mistake with the doors. I myself started life as a volunteer zookeeper in 1980, caring for gorillas and chimpanzees. Those of us who have had the privilege of caring for great apes become quickly aware of their individual characters and tailor our care to account for each of their personality traits. Kumbuka is the alpha male in our gorilla troop at ZSL London Zoo, an impressive male in both stature and character. Kumbuka has fathered two infants and is a patient and protective father, who displays typical silverback behaviour, such as beating his chest and posturing. Gorilla Kingdom is his home and territory and as his family grows, so will Kumbuka’s naturally protective instincts. I have the utmost respect for Kumbuka and the gorilla troop – a respect that I know is shared by all of my zookeeper colleagues, who also recognise the important responsibility they have in caring for them. The magnitude of personal responsibility that zookeepers feel for the animals in their care, the colleagues they work with every day and the thousands of visitors to their zoo is indescribable. It is this sense of responsibility that provides some of our strongest security measures. We know that humans sometimes make mistakes, but these are rare. We also know that automating every security system poses a greater risk of mechanical failure, and could lead to an over-reliance on technology that will create the kind of complacency that has no place here. We will continue to work with our keeping teams to identify any adjustments or modifications that can help avoid any repeat mistake in future, but ultimately our trust in our people is not shaken. Today, Kumbuka and his family are happily playing, eating and sleeping in Gorilla Kingdom. Gorillas invoke the most remarkable feelings of wonder from anyone who sees them and our visitors can continue to be assured that these animals are safe, secure and in the care of a team of dedicated zookeepers. ||||| Fruit-flavoured squash before and after being mixed with water Squash (also known as cordial), in British English, is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and sugar or a sugar substitute. Modern squashes may also contain food colouring and additional flavouring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger. Drinks [ edit ] Squash is mixed with a certain amount of water or carbonated water before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a drink mixer, it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a cocktail. Citrus fruits (particularly orange, lime and lemon) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.[1] Traditional squashes are usually flavoured with ginger, chokeberries (often with spices added), elderflower, and sometimes orange or lemon.[citation needed] Preparation [ edit ] Squash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water (carbonated or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water. Storage [ edit ] Most cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators. Ingredients [ edit ] Ingredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings. Flavourings [ edit ] Traditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry. Modern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon. Terminology [ edit ] \\"Cordial\\", \\"diluted juice\\", and \\"squash\\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended.[citation needed] In British English, \\"cordial\\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup).[2] \\"High juice\\" is not a brand of squash but rather a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%. Squash is often colloquially known as \\"juice\\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \\"fruit drink\\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., Fruit Shoot). Some small areas in the North East refer to squash as \\"dilutey juice\\". Fruit juice content [ edit ] Squashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as \\"high juice\\", and squashes are quite often called \\"juice\\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \\"with real fruit juice\\" on the label. Low-sugar squashes [ edit ] Squashes labelled \\"no added sugar\\" are artificially sweetened, usually with aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They tend to be very low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) to make up for the lack of fruit juice taste. World markets [ edit ] Assorted bottles of squash at a grocery store in Argentina Britvic (under the Robinsons, MiWadi and Teisseire brands), Hamdard (under the Rooh Afza brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the Vimto brand), Suntory (under the Ribena brand) and Coca-Cola (under the Kia-Ora brand). Australian brands include Cottee's, Bickford's, P&N Beverages and Golden Circle cordials. Indian brands include Kissan and Rasna. In Israel, fruit squashes are produced by such companies as Prigat. Animal consumption [ edit ] The gorillas at London Zoo are given both squash and cold fruit tea to drink. When a silverback called Kumbuka escaped from his enclosure in 2016, he drank five litres (8.8 imperial pints) of undiluted blackcurrant squash that was in the keepers' area.[3] See also [ edit ] |||||Summary:","completion":"When Kumbuka, a gorilla, escaped from his enclosure at the London Zoo, he drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash before he was tranquillised. According to a spokeswoman, the gorillas at the zoo are given diluted squash every day as part of their daily diet, along with cold fruit tea and leafy greens such as cabbage and kale, and other fresh vegetables, such as broccoli, carrots and cucumber. Professor Phyllis Lee, a primatologist, explains that the large amount of concentrated squash could have caused Kumbuka severe stomach pains and diarrhoea. However, she adds that it would not have had any long-lasting effects on his teeth, as that would only be caused by continually consuming sugary beverages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Summi Pontificatus is an encyclical of Pope Pius XII published on 20 October 1939. The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835 20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name. - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City. - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.

Even though the state is smaller than the country, it is better because the Available choices: -state has zero debt... -country has zero debt...","completion":"Even though the state is smaller than the country, it is better because the state has zero debt. Zero debt indicates that the state has effectively managed its resources and maintained a stable, secure financial system. This is crucial as it presents numerous advantages over a country with debt, which can lead to negative consequences for its citizens. Firstly, having zero debt means the state can continue to invest in essential public services without being hindered by interest payments. This subsequently improves the quality of life for the residents within the state. Better infrastructure, such as roads, schools, hospitals, and public transport, can be built, maintained, and upgraded. This leads to a more prosperous region, which in turn fosters a thriving economy where businesses can flourish. Moreover, having zero debt allows the state more maneuverability within its budget. With no debt to service, the state can allocate funds towards pressing social issues, such as education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation, thereby ensuring a healthier, more educated population. This results in a more productive workforce, which is vital for economic growth. Furthermore, the state, being smaller in size compared to the country, has the advantage of being easier to manage and govern. This allows for more efficient decision-making and implementation of policies. The state's smaller size also gives it the ability to react to economic changes and challenges more promptly than the country, providing a more stable and secure financial landscape. In comparison, a country with debt can face numerous problems. High debt levels can lead to increased interest rates, which then places additional strain on public finances. This results in reduced government spending on crucial public services, negatively impacting the citizens' quality of life. Additionally, countries with large debts are often subject to external pressures and influences from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. These institutions may impose austerity measures that can further cut public spending, leading to sociopolitical instability and unrest as citizens struggle with fewer resources and less support. Also, countries with a massive debt burden are more likely to experience economic slowdowns as their debt consumes a significant portion of government expenditure. This leaves less room for investments that boost economic growth or respond to sudden crises. High debt levels can damage the country's credit rating, making it difficult and expensive to borrow funds in the future, which adds further strain to the nation's finances. In conclusion, the state's zero debt demonstrates its effective management of resources and financial stability, paving the way for a thriving economy, improved public services, and an enhanced overall quality of life. This is preferable to a country with debt, which faces numerous challenges and negative consequences for its citizens. The state's smaller size and zero debt further underscore its ability to be more agile and responsive to economic challenges and opportunities, making it a better choice for a prosperous future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP. In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file. Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro. What was it called","completion":"The album was called \\"Teri Yakimoto.\\" This album continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (a). be prepared to eat; (b). eat until he vomits food; (c). not make too much noise chewing;","completion":"To determine what Cameron will want to do next, let's analyze each option step-by-step: Option (a). be prepared to eat: - Since Cameron brought his lunch to a picnic in a park, it's reasonable to assume that he went there to enjoy the meal. Being prepared to eat fits with the context of having a picnic, and it aligns with Cameron's actions. Option (b). eat until he vomits food: - It is unlikely that Cameron would want to eat to the point of vomiting, as this would be uncomfortable and unpleasant. Generally, people eat meals with the intention of satisfying their hunger and enjoying the food, not overeating to the point of sickness. Option (c). not make too much noise chewing: - This option can be a goal while eating, as some people may want to be conscious of the noise they make while chewing their food. However, it is not necessarily the primary goal or the next step Cameron would take after bringing his lunch to the park. Based on analysis, it's reasonable to say that Cameron will likely choose option (a) - to be prepared to eat. This is because it fits with the context of having a picnic and aligns with his primary goal: to eat his lunch while enjoying the park."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer?","completion":"The common mineral formed by the fossilization of vegetation is coal. Coal is an organic sedimentary rock primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, as well as small amounts of sulfur and other elements. It is created through a complex process called coalification, which involves the transformation of plant material into the solid, black and combustible substance known as coal. Coal formation begins when large amounts of plant material, such as trees, ferns, and other vegetation, accumulate in swampy, low-oxygen environments known as peatlands or mires. In these damp conditions, the plant material does not fully decompose and instead accumulates as peat. Over time, the accumulated peat is buried by sediment, such as sand or clay, which helps to protect it from complete destruction by microbes and atmospheric oxygen. As more layers of sediment are deposited on top of the peat, it is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature. These conditions cause the peat to undergo a series of chemical and physical changes, which drive off volatile substances like water and methane and leave behind a carbon-rich substance. Gradually, the peat turns into lignite, also known as brown coal, which is a low-quality coal with a high moisture and ash content. With continued pressure and increased temperature over millions of years, the lignite undergoes further transformation, becoming sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and finally anthracite coal. Each stage of transformation results in a coal type with higher carbon content, energy density, and overall quality. However, it is important to note that not all peat deposits progress through each stage of coalification, as the process is heavily dependent on specific environmental conditions, such as the type of plant material, temperature, and pressure. Coal has played a significant role in human history, as it was one of the first fossil fuels utilized for energy production. It fueled the industrial revolution and continues to be an important energy source globally, particularly for electricity generation. The combustion of coal releases energy in the form of heat, which can then be used to turn water into steam and drive turbines in power plants. However, the use of coal as an energy source has also had significant negative effects, as burning coal releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These emissions contribute to climate change, acid rain, and air pollution, which have negative impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the environment. As a result, there has been a growing push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, to minimize the detrimental effects of fossil fuel consumption. In summary, the common mineral formed by the fossilization of vegetation is coal. This organic sedimentary rock is created through the accumulation and transformation of plant material under specific environmental conditions. Coal has been crucial for human civilization as an energy source, but its use has also led to various negative environmental and health impacts, prompting a quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy alternatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the people who find Holly's video camera? Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah escapes the cave with no memory of the events. She is taken to a hospital, where it is found that some of the blood on her belongs to Juno Kaplan. Sheriff Vaines takes his deputy Elen Rios, Sarah, and three spelunking specialists – Dan, Greg, and Cath – to the cave to find the missing women. The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald. The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance. While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg. The three decide to find an alternate way around in order to try to free Cath and arrive in a room full of bones, where they find Holly's video camera. They watch it and realize the women were attacked by the crawlers. The three are then themselves attacked by crawlers and separated. Rios starts calling for help, alerting the crawlers to her location, but is rescued by Sarah. The two then watch as a crawler kills Dan and drags his body away, prompting Sarah to inform Rios that the crawlers are blind and hunt via sound. After escaping from and killing a crawler, Cath finds Greg before the two escape from another crawler and find Sam's body. They decide to try to use her to swing across a chasm, but are attacked again. Greg sacrifices himself to buy time for Cath, but she ultimately does not survive.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Events in Colombia over recent months have Â once again thrust the the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) into the spotlight. The group has spent decades battling the Colombian government, proclaiming its struggle to be a fight for the country's poor against their wealthy oppressors. However the Colombian government and other detractors say the group is responsible for a string of rights abuses, including bomb attacks, kidnappings, assassinations and extortion of local businesses. Human rights organisations have condemned the Farc's used of child fighters and its indiscriminate targeting of civilians. They are also accused of hypocrisy for funding much of their activities through the trafficking of cocaine, with around 65 of the group's 110 operational units involved in the trade, according to a 2005 International Crisis Group report. The group's roots lie in what is known in Colombia as \\"La Violencia\\", a bloody period in the 1940s and 1950s sparked when Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, a popular left-wing politician, was assassinated, leading to a wave of violence between right-wing and left-wing armed groups. Manuel 'Sureshot' Marulanda is theleader of the Farc [GALLO/GETTY]TheÂ fighting leftÂ up toÂ 300,000 people dead and spawned several groups, including the Farc, the ELN and M-19 movements. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the country's Communist Party (although 1966 has also been mooted as the date), the group spent the 1960s and 1970s acting as a \\"guerilla\\" force carrying out operations against the military in its heartland of the south and east of Colombia. However, during the 1980s, the movement developed a formal army structure, organising into squads and fronts. The group is governed by a seven-member secretariat, led by Manuel Marulanda, nicknamed \\"Tirofijo\\" or \\"Sureshot\\" because of his reported shooting skills. The group was believed to have had about 16,000 fighters in 2001, although that figure now is down to between 6,000 and 8,000, according to the government. The Farc has been involved in on-off peace negotiations since 1984, when it set up a political party, the Patriotic Union, to achieve its ends. But the party was undermined by a series of assassinations by right-wing paramilitaries and in 1985, the group returned to its armed campaign. In 1998 the then-president of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, allocated a 42,000 square kilometre safe haven for the Farc, which had previously been a pre-condition of the group for peace talks. However by 2002 negotiations stalled after attacks continued and Pastrana ordered the army to retake the territory. Protesters have demanded IngridÂ Betancourt's release [AFP]In an attempt to force the government to accede to itsÂ demands and to release captured fighters, the Farc has taken hundreds of hostages. These include Ingrid Betancourt, a former presidential candidate, and three US military contractors. The hostages are held in poor conditions, sometimes in cages deep in jungle areas controlled by the Farc. One hostage released by the Farc said he and others had suffered \\"subhuman conditions\\" during their captivity. The group has recently released some captives on what it has said are ethical grounds in a deal brokered byÂ Hugo Chavez, theÂ Venezuelan president,Â but it rejected a government deal over Betancourt, saying its fighters must be released from Colombian jails first. In 2002 Alvaro Uribe was elected president of Colombia. A more \\"hardline\\" politician than his predecessor, his own father, a wealthy landowner, was assassinated by the Farc during a failed kidnapping attempt. Uribe has intensified the Colombian military assault on the Farc andÂ the Colombian army'sÂ better-equipped forces, trained and advised by the US, have scored a number of significant victories. A number of senior commanders have been killed, including Raul Reyes, who died in a controversial a cross-border raid on Farc camp in Ecuador by the Colombian military, which sparked a still lingering diplomatic crisis in the region. The group has also suffered a number of desertions as fighters became disillusioned with the group's involvement in the drug trade. But while the group has suffered a number of setbacks, it is far from defeated. Chavez has offered Farc vocal support and earlier this year called forÂ the groupÂ and the smaller ELN organisation to be removed from government lists of terror groups. And the Colombian government may now be more wary of carrying out cross-border military operations against the Farc, after Latin American governments reacted angrily to its raid into Ecuador.

It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires. The main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, physical changes have ceased, and since that time the area has degraded due to national economic stagnation.

By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise.

Please add spaces between words: Champagnetobeworldheritage","completion":"Here is the sentence with spaces added between the words: Champagne to be world heritage This sentence seems to be referring to the Champagne region in France being designated as a World Heritage site. The World Heritage designation is awarded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to places that have cultural, historical, or natural significance and are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. The Champagne region is highly valued for its unique and rich history, as well as its cultural and economic significance. The region is known for its vineyards, which produce the world-famous Champagne wine. This sparkling wine is distinguished by the unique method used to make it, known as the méthode champenoise, which involves a secondary fermentation process that takes place within the bottle. This technique is responsible for the wine's effervescence and is a key reason why Champagne has become an iconic and sought-after luxury item. One of the main factors that make the region worthy of the World Heritage designation is the long and fascinating history behind the production of Champagne wine. The origins of winemaking in the region date back to the Roman era, and the production of sparkling wine began to take shape in the 17th century. It was during this time that the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon played a crucial role in perfecting many of the techniques that are still utilized today in the production of Champagne. His work led to the development of a clear, sparkling wine that became highly demanded by the French nobility and other elites throughout Europe. Another factor contributing to the significance of the Champagne region is its cultural importance, which has grown over the centuries. Champagne has become synonymous with celebrations, important events, and the enjoyment of life. It is a symbol of elegance, refinement, and prosperity and has played a central role as a status symbol in numerous artistic and cultural expressions, including movies, literature, and high-society events. In addition to its historical and cultural value, the Champagne region boasts stunning landscapes and architectural heritage. The gently rolling hills covered with vineyards, the unique, chalky soils, and the intricate network of cellars and tunnels located beneath the region's towns and cities are all part of what makes the Champagne region so exceptional. These tunnels, some of which date back to the Roman period, serve as safe and stable storage for millions of bottles of Champagne, ensuring that they age properly and maintain their quality over time. Given these factors, the decision to designate the Champagne region as a World Heritage site is understandable, as it recognizes and preserves the unique history, culture, and beauty of the region. This designation not only promotes the distinctive character of the area and its wines but also encourages sustainable tourism and responsible development in the region. In conclusion, the Champagne region's World Heritage status is a testament to the valuable contribution that this area has made, and continues to make, to the world's cultural and gastronomic heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), based in London, was formed by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946. In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra's right to call itself \\"Royal\\" could be withdrawn. Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Andre Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and most recently Charles Dutoit. From the RPO's earliest days to the end of Beecham's life, they made numerous recordings for His Master's Voice, CBS and RCA. Among the works they recorded EMI chose several to be reissued at the end of the twentieth century in its \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\" series. They included a Delius programme; a Grieg programme; French ballet music; short works by Bizet, Chabrier, Faure and Saint-Saens; Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 4 and Nutcracker Suite; Mozart's Jupiter Symphony, Clarinet Concerto (Brymer) and Bassoon Concerto (Brooke); and Schubert's 3rd, 5th and 6th Symphonies. After Beecham's death the orchestra made many recordings for Decca, sometimes under pseudonyms such as the \\"Beecham Symphony Orchestra\\", the \\"London Festival Orchestra\\" and the \\"Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra\\". Among the conductors with whom the RPO recorded in the 1960s were Sir John Barbirolli, Fritz Reiner, Charles Munch, Georges Pretre, Kempe, Previn and Stokowski. Soloists included Earl Wild, Shura Cherkassky, Alan Civil and Luciano Pavarotti. Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera The Rake's Progress with the RPO in 1964. Colin Davis made some of his earliest recordings with the orchestra, including Mozart and Rossini overtures, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, and Stravinsky's Oedipus rex. From 1964 to 1979 the RPO was engaged by Decca to record Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The orchestra has also recorded for Deutsche Grammophon, Lyrita, Philips, Pye and Unicorn-Kanchana. In 1986, the orchestra launched RPO Records, claimed to be \\"the world's first record label to be owned by a symphony orchestra\\". Recordings available on the RPO label in 2013 ranged from core symphonic repertoire and Tchaikovsky ballet scores to film music by various composers, light music by Burt Bacharach and Richard Rodgers, and an album called \\"Symphonic Rock\\", described as \\"Over 3 hours of classic rock anthems and pop tracks with an orchestral twist\\".

This pump is basically on-off for anything but a new Simmerlite stove. It's on was also barely a simmering flame, so much of my trip was spent babying the stove, praying that the silly thing would actually boil a pot of water.Upon my return, I took the pump back to the shop for a refund.

Well having walked around the small shopping plaza, we stumbled across this place. More drawn in by the name than anything else, and having recently seen an episode of Bourdain eating shwarma, Greek sounded pretty good to me.

Well, we stood there for a while and after about a minute or two, another employee came and seated us. Having taken a long time driving around for something to eat, my friend and I took a quick survey of the menu and quickly decided on our appetizer (feta fries) and our entrees (I had the Gyro plate, my girl had the steak kabobs). While I was not very impressed with much at this place, I will give this place credit for the feta fries. They were hands down the best part of the meal and possibly the best feta fries I've ever had. The cheese was delicious and there was a light rosemary based sauce drizzled on top which was just a perfect compliment to the fries and cheese. Unfortunately, this is where the good part of the meal ended. Having waited a good half hour after we had already finished our fries, my gyro plate was nothing to write home about - it was your usual fair with somewhat over cooked rice, sauteed vegetables, and way too little pita and tzatziki sauce for the amount of meat. My friend's steak kabobs were all but inedible - cold and seasoned with entirely way too much salt, the meat was salty to the point that it was borderline bitter. Poor girl just ate the rice and veggies and left the kabobs all but untouched. Well, overall, this place did not impressed. Not only was the food not very good, the service was also pretty terrible.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Question 1: What all government jobs can I get that do not require minimum %? There are several government jobs that do not have a minimum percentage requirement. These positions focus more on the skills and knowledge of the applicant, rather than their academic performance in terms of percentages. Here are some examples of such government jobs: 1. Lower Division Clerk (LDC)/Upper Division Clerk (UDC) - These positions usually involve administrative tasks, such as data entry and document management. The main requirement for these jobs can range from qualifying in entrance exams conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) or any other state-level recruitment board. 2. Multitasking Staff (MTS) - The primary role of MTS personnel is to provide support services in various government departments. The selection is done on the basis of a competitive examination conducted by the Staff Selection Commission or state-level recruitment boards. 3. Constable - A constable is an entry-level police officer. To become one, you need to qualify for the Police Constable Recruitment Exam, which is organized by several state police departments. There is no minimum percentage required, although there may be a requirement for minimum educational qualifications such as 10th or 12th standard pass. 4. Railway jobs - Indian Railways is one of the largest employers in India, and they offer jobs for various positions ranging from technical to non-technical roles. Some positions, like Trackman, Helper, or Porter, might not require a minimum percentage, but will need the candidate to pass a written and physical examination. 5. Drivers - Government departments require drivers to operate their official vehicles. With a valid driving license and some experience, you can apply for driver positions in various departments. There is no minimum percentage requirement for such positions. It is essential to note that, although these jobs do not have a minimum percentage requirement, they may still require the applicants to possess specific educational qualifications and skills, and to pass different recruitment-based examinations. Question 2: What do you think SMEs should expect from cloud service providers in the near future? Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly started to adopt cloud services to simplify and streamline their business operations. In the near future, SMEs can expect the following from cloud service providers: 1. Enhanced Security: With growing cyber threats and data breaches, cloud service providers need to continuously improve their security measures. SMEs can expect advanced and strong security protocols, ensuring the safety of their sensitive data. 2. Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud providers should offer agile and easily scalable solutions to accommodate the growing needs of SMEs. Services should be designed to allow companies to scale up or down as needed without incurring excessive costs. 3. Cost-effective Solutions: As SMEs usually have limited budgets, cloud service providers should offer cost-effective and customized solutions that cater to the specific needs of small and medium businesses. 4. Simplified Integration: SMEs can expect better integration and interoperability between different cloud services, applications, and platforms, streamlining their processes and making it easier to manage complex business requirements. 5. Consulting and Managed Services: To help SMEs make better decisions and optimize their IT infrastructure, cloud providers should offer consulting and managed services that offer expert guidance in leveraging cloud technologies for their specific business needs. 6. Improved Data Privacy and Compliance: Cloud providers should ensure that their services adhere to strict data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, and support SMEs in staying compliant with their industry standards and legal requirements. 7. Enhanced Customer Support: Timely and efficient customer support is crucial for SMEs using cloud services. They can expect improved and more responsive support options, including 24/7 availability, quicker response times, and expert assistance for resolving issues. To conclude, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about government jobs that do not require a minimum percentage, while the second question is about the expectations of SMEs from cloud service providers in the near future.

Here is a news article: Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones talks to supporters as he campaigns at Niki's West restaurant in Birmingham, Ala., in October. | Brynn Anderson Alabama polls show close race after Moore accusations The first wave of flash polls conducted after Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore was accused of abusing a 14-year-old girl nearly four decades ago point to a close race between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones. Since The Washington Post published a story online Thursday afternoon in which four women accused Moore of making romantic or sexual advances on them when they were teenagers, four polls — all conducted using less expensive methodologies — have showed the candidates roughly neck-and-neck. The most recently released survey, an automated poll from the Republican-leaning firm JMC Analytics and Polling, shows the Democrat leading by 4 percentage points. Story Continued Below Jones leads Moore in the JMC Analytics poll, 48 percent to 44 percent, with 8 percent undecided or favoring another candidate in Alabama's Dec. 12 special Senate election. The poll was conducted last Thursday through Saturday. The previous JMC Analytics survey, conducted in late September and early October, showed Moore ahead by 8 points. JMC conducts landline-only polls administered by an automated interviewer. Moore has a 4-point lead in a Change Research poll, conducted online Thursday through Saturday, 44 percent to 40 percent — with a larger share of undecided voters, 16 percent. The two other surveys were each conducted in a single day — a practice that increases the prospect of error, according to polling experts, because it tends to include the easiest voters to reach. A Gravis Marketing survey, conducted Friday for the blog Big League Politics via automated calls to landlines and online interviews with cellphone-only voters, had Moore at 48 percent and Jones at 46 percent, with 6 percent undecided.

You can unsubscribe at any time. The other one-day poll was conducted Thursday night — immediately after the Post story about Moore. That survey, conducted by Opinion Savvy for Decision Desk HQ and interviewing voters via automated calls to landlines and mobile respondents via ads or push notifications from their applications, found the two candidates knotted at 46 percent. Each of the new polls has potential shortcomings. Nearly half of Alabama adults, 46 percent, lived in a household without a landline, according to 2015 data; the percentage is almost certainly larger today. One of the four polls didn’t interview respondents without a landline at all, while two of the others blended landline interviews with cellphone voters reached online or via smartphone apps. The Change Research poll was conducted entirely online but required respondents to self-identify as Alabama voters likely to cast ballots in a low-turnout race. (Breitbart News, which is backing Moore and has cast doubt on the molestation allegations against him, reported that an in-state consulting firm that has worked for Moore in the past found the Republican ahead by 10 points in a Saturday-evening survey, though that poll wasn't released publicly.) Previously, polls of likely voters in the special election had showed Moore with a more consistent lead. But these new, instant polls are often misleading barometers of how sudden, negative news coverage can impact a campaign. Donald Trump cratered in the polls in the immediate wake of the “Access Hollywood” video — in which Trump joked about sexually assaulting women — roughly a month before last year’s presidential election. But Trump recovered in subsequent weeks, winning the Electoral College and finishing about 2 percentage points behind Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. The Moore story has some parallels in recent Senate races. Five years ago, after then-Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) made his infamous “legitimate rape” comment in an interview with a St. Louis TV station, four immediate polls showed results ranging from a 1-point Akin lead to a 10-point advantage for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). Before that, Akin had led every public poll of the race conducted that year. McCaskill would build on her lead over the final weeks of the campaign, eventually trouncing Akin by 16 points. In that case, Republicans first tried to push Akin out of the race, then abandoned him en masse — including Mitt Romney, the party’s presidential nominee. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), then-chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in the weeks following Akin’s comment that the committee wouldn’t spend money to help Akin defeat McCaskill. It was later revealed in campaign finance reports filed after the election that the NRSC made a late cash transfer to the Missouri Republican Party. “We needed to do what we needed to do to help win Senate seats,” Cornyn told POLITICO in December 2012. Also in 2012, Republican Richard Mourdock similarly found himself in hot water over comments about rape and pregnancy in an Indiana Senate race. Indiana prohibits automated-phone polling, so there was little public data available to track how large a factor Mourdock’s statement was in his eventual loss to then-Rep. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.). Mourdock’s publicly released internal polls showed him and Donnelly neck-and-neck, while a Donnelly internal poll showed the Democrat leading by a larger margin. Donnelly won by 6 points on Election Day. Most rigorous campaign polling is done over three days to ensure pollsters aren’t capturing only the most easily reached voters, so both parties will likely be poring over new polling data over the next few days. Don’t expect to see this polling in the public domain: Democrats are wary of nationalizing the race in a state Trump carried by nearly 30 points last fall, and Republicans are unlikely to make a public display of support for a candidate accused of sexually abusing a minor — or to release data that show the GOP nominee struggling. But the decisions made by both parties over the coming week will likely be informed by what that data suggest about how Alabama voters are reacting to the scandal. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Dr. Benjamin Stone is a hotshot young surgeon who longs to leave the drudgery of a Washington , D.C. emergency room and finally leaps at his chance at more money and less death as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills . On his last day , Ben's relationship with his co-workers is presumed to be anything but a warm one . None of his colleagues will join him for a drink and a cake in his honor has an iced portion of the phrase \`\` Good riddance , asshole '' sliced out . Ben's cross-country drive in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady , South Carolina . The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans , who sentences him to community service at a nearby hospital . Ben offers to pay for the fence , but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back . Defeated , he reports to the hospital , where Nurse Packer humbles him by ordering him to clock in and out , as would a factory worker . Though upset , Ben quickly makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson , the town cafe's proprietor/head waitress , and Melvin , the local mechanic tasked with repairing Ben's car . Ben soon finds his clinic work to be much more laid-back than the emergency room . He has simple cases such as spots before the eyes , fishing hook impalings , and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple , whose baby he later delivers .

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Five days ago, Miranda Mann huddled in a science classroom at Southmoore High School. She should have been filed with pride, relief and excitement about her upcoming graduation. Instead, she was filled with fear as a devastating tornado powered through her central Oklahoma city. The 18-year-old has been literally picking up the pieces of her life since. Her house was unrecognizable, except for her and her mother's cars, after the twister destroyed it Monday. Her family sifted through rubble and salvaged some things, only to see many of them -- such as her prized book collection -- ruined by torrential rains. Mann doesn't want to live in Moore, wary of a place that's been hit by two EF5 tornadoes -- the strongest possible -- over the past 14 years. There's been plenty of time, and way too many reasons, for tears. But finally ... finally, Saturday was a time to smile. \\"My family is all here, we get to be together,\\" Mann said about her graduation at Oklahoma City's Cox Convention Center. \\"(You can) relax and let your hair down, because you know that we're not going back to the house today. We're not going to see that.\\" Southmoore High's seniors were one of three classes celebrating their commencement ceremonies at the facility. The date had been set for months, and it wasn't moved after the storm killed 24 people, injured more than 375 others and damaged 12,000 residences in and around the metropolitan area. A tornado bearing down; a mom in labor. Jake Spradling is glad the show went on. Like Mann, he's a Southmoore High senior; like her, he no longer has a place to call home. The hours since Monday have been \\"overwhelming,\\" Spradling admitted, though he said the outpouring of support -- offers to bunk early at Northwestern Oklahoma State University where he'll head this fall, dozens of text messages and \\"calls out of the wazoo\\" with offers of help -- have made a big difference. He knows people who lost family members, and many more who lost homes. He knows that they need time to plan and attend funerals, to clean up debris, to figure out what happens next. Even with all that, \\"I'm glad it's today,\\" Spradling said. \\"It means to me that we're not going on different routes. \\"We're staying on the same path that we were meant to be on.\\" One block, two tornadoes: Life in the crosshairs. Graduation festivities were infused by the tragedy, including speakers' remarks and other poignant reminders. One happened when Southmoore's Alyson Costilla walked across the stage to get her diploma and about a dozen people in the crowd stood up and held up pictures of her mother Terri Long, who died in a 7-Eleven ravaged by the powerful winds. Outside the convention center, the seniors from Southmoore, Westmoore and Moore high schools won't have to go far to be reminded of the devastation. Funeral homes and churches are busy with services for those killed. A balm after the storm. Ten of those killed were children, including seven second- and third-graders at Plaza Towers Elementary School. After three funerals earlier in the week, two more of those students were to be buried Saturday. Transforming Moore back into the city it had been won't be easy. Its public schools alone suffered 45 million in damage, including the two elementary schools that were leveled. Insurance claims related to Monday's storm will likely top 2 billion, according to Kelly Collins from the Oklahoma Insurance Department. But residents aren't doing it all alone. Honest advice from Joplin to Moore. Besides the presence of FEMA representatives and other public officials on the ground, they've had friends, relatives, even strangers come out to help. Sharon Liston has spent the last 25 years teaching math at Westmoore High, from which she's retiring after 40 years total in the profession. On Friday, a day before her school's graduation, a caravan of students arrived at her home to clean up her 3-acre property. \\"It looked like a wall of students with trash cans and trash sacks, and they literally picked up every stick within that three acres there,\\" Liston said. Principals recall day tornado hit. That kind of help makes it easier for Moore's residents to move on from this horrific week. Saturday's graduation ceremonies are similar, in that way. It means the end of one thing, and the beginning of another. A fresh start. \\"It's just the closing of one chapter and the opening of another,\\" Spradling said. \\"...It's one of those flipping of the pages that means a lot to everybody here.\\" Tornado heading your way?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Evers was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of the five children (including older brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, eventually earning his high school diploma. Medgar Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist population were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife Myrlie had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing or other kind of attack on their lives. Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and one police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. Many believe that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan. In the early morning of June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Evers's family had worried for his safety the day of his assassination and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt himself in a greater danger than usual. When he arrived home, Evers's family was waiting for him and his children exclaimed to his wife, Myrlie, that he had arrived. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read \\"Jim Crow Must Go\\", Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet ripped through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered 30 feet (10 meters) before collapsing. His wife Myrlie was the first to find him outside of their front door. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. His family explained who he was and he was admitted; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later. Evers was the first African American to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi, a questionable achievement for the dying activist. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000. After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, Reverend Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came prepared with riot gear and rifles in case the protests turned violent. While tensions were initially high in the stand off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained nonviolence among their followers.","completion":"This text is about Medgar Evers, who was an African American civil rights activist from Mississippi.

Please add spaces between words: Itisastoragetechnologywhichisusedtocombinemultipledisksintoasinglelogicalunit.","completion":"It is a storage technology which is used to combine multiple disks into a single logical unit. In the modern era of technology, organizations and individuals deal with an enormous amount of data. Efficient data storage and management are critical for smooth operations and data recovery in case of failures. One solution to manage this task is by using a storage technology that combines multiple disks into a single logical unit. This technology is called RAID, which stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID is a powerful data storage technology that combines the storage capacity and processing power of multiple physical hard drives into a single unit. By distributing the data across these drives, RAID offers various benefits, including improved reliability, performance, and redundancy. There are several RAID levels, each designed to provide different degrees of data protection, capacity, and performance. Some common RAID levels are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 6. Each RAID level uses a different method for combining and distributing data among multiple hard drives: 1. RAID 0 (Striping): This RAID level offers improved performance by splitting data into smaller blocks and distributing these blocks across all the hard drives in the array. It does not provide any redundancy or fault tolerance, making it less suitable for sensitive data storage, as the failure of one disk can result in complete data loss. 2. RAID 1 (Mirroring): RAID 1 provides data redundancy by duplicating data across two or more disks. In this configuration, the same data is stored on each disk, offering complete redundancy. If one disk fails, the other disk(s) can still provide access to the data without any data loss. RAID 1 is commonly used for providing fault tolerance but is less efficient in terms of storage capacity since it requires double the amount of storage. 3. RAID 5 (Distributed Parity): In RAID 5, data blocks are distributed among multiple disks, with each disk holding a portion of the data and an associated parity block. Parity blocks are used to reconstruct the missing data if a disk fails. RAID 5 requires a minimum of three disks and provides a balance between storage efficiency, performance, and fault tolerance. It can continue to function with the loss of one disk, but if a second disk fails before the first one is replaced, data will be lost. 4. RAID 6 (Dual Distributed Parity): RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but uses two parity blocks per disk instead of one, providing even higher redundancy and fault tolerance. It can handle the failure of two disks simultaneously without data loss. RAID 6 requires a minimum of four disks and is especially suited for large storage systems where reliability and data protection are critical. In conclusion, combining multiple disks into a single logical unit using RAID technology is an efficient means of managing and safeguarding data, especially in large-scale operations. By selecting an appropriate RAID level, organizations and individuals can achieve the desired balance between storage capacity, data protection, and performance to suit their specific needs."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Simon says that he was initially altruistic and was inspired to enter journalism by the Washington Post's coverage of Watergate but became increasingly pragmatic as he gained experience. Later in his career he aimed to tell the best possible story without \\"cheating it\\". Simon was a union captain when the writing staff went on strike in 1987 over benefit cuts. He remained angry after the strike ended and began to feel uncomfortable in the writing room. He searched for a reason to justify a leave of absence and settled on the idea of writing a novel. \\"I got out of journalism because some sons of bitches bought my newspaper and it stopped being fun,\\" says Simon. In an interview in Reason in 2004, Simon said that since leaving the newspaper business he has become more cynical about the power of journalism. \\"One of the sad things about contemporary journalism is that it actually matters very little. The world now is almost inured to the power of journalism. The best journalism would manage to outrage people. And people are less and less inclined to outrage,\\" said Simon. \\"I've become increasingly cynical about the ability of daily journalism to effect any kind of meaningful change. I was pretty dubious about it when I was a journalist, but now I think it's remarkably ineffectual.\\" In 1988, disillusioned, Simon took a year's leave to go into the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit to write a book. What was his relationship with journalism?","completion":"Simon's relationship with journalism began with an initial sense of altruism and inspiration from the Washington Post's coverage of Watergate. He felt that journalism was \\"God's work\\" and had a great passion for it. He worked as a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun from 1982 to 1995, mostly covering the crime beat. However, over time, Simon became increasingly pragmatic and focused on telling the best possible story without compromising it. His relationship with journalism started to change as he grew disillusioned with the field, especially after the strike he participated in as a union captain in 1987 over benefit cuts. This led him to take a leave of absence and explore other areas, such as writing a novel. Simon's departure from journalism was also influenced by the frustration he felt after his newspaper was bought and its work environment changed. In the years following his departure, Simon's views on journalism evolved further, eventually becoming quite cynical. He believed that contemporary journalism had lost its power to bring about meaningful change and lacked the ability to spark outrage in people. Overall, Simon's relationship with journalism was complex, marked by passion and love for the job in the beginning and evolving into disillusionment, frustration, and cynicism over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The film stars Emily Browning , Abbie Cornish , Jena Malone , Vanessa Hudgens , Jamie Chung , and Carla Gugino . Question: what songs are used in the sucker punch trailer Answer:","completion":"The film Sucker Punch, directed by Zack Snyder and released in 2011, features an ensemble cast that includes Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung, and Carla Gugino. The film is known for its unique visual style, as well as its incorporation of music to emphasize the action sequences and overall themes. Regarding the songs used in the Sucker Punch trailers, several trailers were released in the lead-up to the film's premiere, each with their distinctive musical choices. Here is a detailed analysis of songs featured in the major Sucker Punch trailers: 1. First official trailer released at Comic-Con 2010: - \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" by Led Zeppelin This classic rock song from the 1971 album Led Zeppelin IV accompanied a majority of the trailer, immersing viewers into the world of Sucker Punch with its iconic heavy beat and powerful vocals by Robert Plant. - \\"#1 Crush\\" by Garbage This song, originally released in 1996, served as the backdrop during the latter part of the trailer, characterized by its sultry and darkly emotive sound. The song complemented the film's mix of fantasy, action, and drama. 2. Theatrical trailer released in 2011: - \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" by Emily Browning The theatrical trailer used a unique take on the Eurythmics' classic hit with the film's lead actress Emily Browning providing the vocals. Browning's haunting and dreamy rendition aligns perfectly with the film's surreal aesthetics, emphasizing the theme of escaping into one's imagination. - \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" by Yoav featuring Emily Browning This cover of the Pixies' influential song from the 1980s complements the film's themes of reality versus fantasy. The use of this song, along with Browning's vocals, helps to establish a connection between the lead character and the film's narrative arc. In conclusion, the trailers for Sucker Punch are notable for their use of music to accentuate the film's distinctive visual style and thematic elements. Featured songs such as \\"When the Levee Breaks,\\" \\"#1 Crush,\\" \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),\\" and \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" contributed to creating an effective and powerful atmosphere in the trailers, sparking curiosity and anticipation for the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: Sam had tickets to the concert hall, but really didn't like to go because it was too loud. He traded them for tickets to what? Options: - city - university building - auditorium - commercial building - theater The answer is \\"theater\\" because Answer:","completion":"Sam had tickets to the concert hall, but really didn't like to go because it was too loud. Since Sam was not interested in attending the loud concert, it suggests that he would prefer an event with a lower volume or different atmosphere. Step 1: Eliminate irrelevant options - city: A city is not an event or a place where one could trade tickets. - commercial building: A commercial building is not an event or a place where one could trade tickets. - university building: Though a university building can hold events, it is not specific enough, and trading concert tickets for entry to a university building seems unlikely. Step 2: Compare remaining options - auditorium: An auditorium could be a venue for another event which might have a lower volume, but it could still be loud depending on the event taking place there. - theater: A theater generally hosts events such as plays, musicals, or other performances that are less likely to be as loud as a concert. Step 3: Choose the best option Based on the available options and the context that Sam wanted to avoid a loud environment, it is most likely that he traded his concert hall tickets for tickets to a theater because theaters are known for hosting events that typically have lower volumes compared to concerts, catering better to Sam's preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Isabel, portrayed by actress Kelen Coleman, is Pam Halpert's (née Beesly) cousin and attends the wedding celebration. In the episodes, many characters from the office are invited to Pam and Jim Halpert's wedding, held in the beautiful destination of Niagara Falls. Amidst the multiple events that take place on Pam and Jim's special day, Dwight is seen trying to find someone he can hook up with during the celebration. At the rehearsal dinner, Dwight initially introduces himself to Pam's sister, Penny Beesly, played by actress Anna Camp. However, Penny turns Dwight down, leading him to set his sights on Isabel. Throughout the wedding episodes, Dwight makes multiple attempts to attract Isabel's attention. It seems that his unusual and slightly aggressive tactics work, as the two end up spending time together during the wedding. At the reception, Dwight and Isabel are seen having an amicable conversation, which eventually leads to them hooking up. Isabel quickly warms to Dwight after discovering they share some common interests. The relationship between the two characters doesn't end at the wedding. Isabel makes a few more appearances in later episodes of the series as someone Dwight remains interested in, and they have an on-again, off-again relationship.

What is the most logical next event? The marching band align in the street with the instruments. After, people play in the marching band in different places. the marching band","completion":"Following the alignment of the marching band in the street and the individual players performing in different locations, the most logical next event would be for the individual band members to regroup, reassemble, and continue with their coordinated performance. This would involve several steps: 1. Communication: The band director or designated leader informs the separate players that it's time to regroup and return to the main performance area. This can be done verbally, through visual signals, or with the help of technology such as two-way radios and smartphones. 2. Gathering individual players: Each band member stops playing at their designated location and begins moving back towards the main performance area to rejoin the group. If necessary, they will need to carefully navigate through the crowd or any obstacles present in the area. 3. Reassembly: As the individual players approach the main performance area, they start to align themselves following the previously determined formation. This may involve rows, arcs, or various geometric patterns, with each instrument section being strategically placed to produce the best possible sound. 4. Designated coordinators: A key role in marching bands is that of \\"section leaders\\" who are responsible for controlling and managing particular instrument sections. Section leaders ensure that their members are following the necessary performance protocols and instructions set forth by the band director, as well as providing individualized guidance when needed. 5. Instrument tuning: Once back in their positions, the band members take a brief moment to check their instruments for correct tuning and make necessary adjustments. It is crucial to ensure that the ensemble produces a harmonious sound when playing together. 6. Resuming the performance: With everyone back in place and ready to continue, the band director signals the start of the next musical piece. The band members follow their sheet music or memorized pieces, adjusting their playing to suit the new performance and ensuring that they are in harmony with their fellow musicians. 7. Engaging the audience: Throughout the reassembled performance, the marching band continues to actively engage with the audience. Members may perform visual maneuvers and formations, play popular or recognizable tunes, or even incorporate dance moves and choreography to add to the overall entertainment value. 8. Continuing the parade or moving to subsequent locations: After performing a designated number of pieces, the marching band may need to move on to the next leg of the parade or another performance location. Following the band director's cues, they will march together in their well-practiced formation, perhaps playing a lively marching tune to keep the crowd entertained as they transition to the next destination. In conclusion, the most logical next event after the marching band's individual performances would be the reassembly of the ensemble, resuming the coordinated performance, and eventually transitioning to the next destination as part of their parade commitments or series of planned performances. This sequence of events would not only ensure a captivating and cohesive performance but also demonstrates the incredible teamwork and discipline required to make a marching band a successful and entertaining spectacle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (nee O'Neal), from Tennessee, and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Aside from recording music, Usher is involved in other businesses, including several restaurants. In 2007 Usher worked with Richard Herpin and Honoring Blanc for the fragrances Usher He and Usher She. The promotion for the fragrance, featured Usher and Martha Stewart in the Macy's, \\"The Magic of Macy's\\" commercial. In September 2008 Usher released the fragrances, UR for Men and UR for Women. Usher fifth fragrance, VIP was launched in 2009. On March 30, 2015, it was announced that Usher is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music video with curated editorial. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. The slogan \\"Turn the tide\\" and the hashtag \\"#TIDALforAll\\" was used by various artists on social media during the buildup to the press conference relaunching the service. Usher, along with sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Beyonce, Rihanna, Madonna, J.Cole, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties.\\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal. On June 28, 2015, Usher became partners with Yoobi the fast-growing school supplies company called based out of Los Angeles. The company donates a portion of its products to schools and has brought in over 20 million in revenue between June 2014 and June 201 Yoobi CEO Ido Leffler told Inc. The Usher line of supplies with Yoobi features a collaboration with Jonni Cheatwood, the artist who does the designing. The slogan is \\"Mixing street smarts with school smarts\\". The collection is available online and at Targets nationwide, and for every purchase, school supplies are donated to kids in need in US classrooms. When asked why he partnered with Yoobi, Usher said, \\"Preparing future leaders through my New Look Foundation has always been about having the proper tools to succeed in life. If they don't have the tools, young men and women from underserved communities can't even begin to understand the idea of having a new or different perspective. So that's where this collaboration came together giving young people the tools and supplying them with hope.\\"","completion":"This text is about the American singer, songwriter, and actor, Usher Raymond IV, commonly known as Usher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The original text, without spaces, can make comprehension difficult, so let's break down the components and discuss each part. - 4 types of people with differing learning styles: This refers to the four commonly known learning styles that people tend to have or lean towards while trying to acquire new knowledge or skills. These learning styles are Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic (often referred to as VARK). People usually have a preference for one or a combination of these learning styles. 1. Visual: Visual learners prefer to see things. They learn more effectively through the use of graphics, diagrams, images, and visual presentations that allow them to visualize the concepts and ideas. They may create concept maps, highlight key points in different colors, or utilize graphic organizers to help them understand complex information. 2. Auditory: Auditory learners are individuals who learn best through listening and talking. They prefer discussions, lectures, and audiobooks over written material. They may benefit from reading aloud, using mnemonic devices, or participating in group discussions and debate. 3. Read/Write: These learners primarily understand and retain information through reading and writing. They may prefer textbooks, written exercises, and taking detailed notes while reading or listening. They tend to benefit from rewriting concepts in their own words, summarizing information, or analyzing written material thoroughly. 4. Kinesthetic: Kinesthetic learners are those who learn best through hands-on experiences. They prefer to engage in physical activities, experiments, demonstrations, and role-playing. These learners may benefit from taking breaks during study sessions, using tangible resources to represent concepts, or associating information with bodily sensations. - Four stages of the learning cycle: This refers to a framework known as the experiential learning cycle developed by David Kolb. The four stages in the cycle are Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation. 1. Concrete Experience: This stage involves the learners actively participating in an experience that exposes them to the subject matter. 2. Reflective Observation: During this stage, learners reflect upon the experience they have been exposed to and identify their thoughts and feelings about it. 3. Abstract Conceptualization: At this stage, the learners try to make sense of their reflections by connecting them with existing knowledge, forming new concepts and ideas, or revising previous beliefs. 4. Active Experimentation: Here, learners apply the newly acquired knowledge to new situations and test out the concepts they have formed. This leads them back to a new concrete experience, restarting the cycle. In conclusion, there is a clear connection between the four types of learners and the four stages of the learning cycle. By understanding different learning styles and applying them to the experiential learning cycle, educators and learners can maximize their potential for knowledge acquisition and personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: You may be so busy dealing with a serious break-up, a job loss, or another significant event in your life that you don't have time to shower or get more than a few hours of sleep a night. However, if you want to be mentally strong, then you have to be physically able, too. If your body is in a funk or you're just feeling unkempt, then you'll be even less equipped to deal with the challenges. No matter how awful you're feeling, you need to make an effort to shower, brush your teeth, sleep, and get into a normal routine, so that you can start feeling as \\"normal\\" as you can. Make sure to make time for mental breaks when you're caring for yourself, too. Studies show that taking mental breaks, whether you're just daydreaming or closing your eyes and listening to a song that you love, can help ward off those stress chemicals and will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. Your self-esteem depends on, among other things, how you value yourself. It's important to form a positive perspective about yourself and about life in general to ensure resilience. In acquiring competencies and responsibilities, you nourish your self-esteem, so it is important to get involved in life and not withdraw into yourself and feel threatened. If you feel that you are worthless, then you will feel incapable of tackling challenges. Use self-enhancement by paying close attention to your positive qualities, while minimizing your negative ones. You can begin by making a list of everything you like about yourself. Seek value through using your talents and abilities to their fullest, be it in a professional, volunteer, business, home front, or other capacity. Learn new abilities and skills as often as you can. This will strengthen your self-esteem and can also ward off fears. For example, if you're afraid your children might be hurt some day, take a basic first aid course to reduce your sense of fear and to increase your confidence in being able to cope should something happen. Workshops, seminars, courses, etc., are all good ways to improve your knowledge and to expand your network of acquaintances on whom you can draw support if needed. Creativity is an expression of yourself and the way in which you live. Creativity lets you unleash what words or conversation cannot express or even understand. Nourishing your creativity can also help you be more creative when finding more solutions to problems, and will show you that you can look at the world in more than one way. Take a photography class, write a poem, take up watercolor painting, redecorate your room in an original way, or consider sewing your own clothes. Though you don't need to have six pack abs to deal with a major crisis, being physically strong certainly helps. Due to the mind-body connection, if your body is stronger, then you have built up the strength and endurance to have a stronger mind, and it will indeed help you in moments of crisis. Being physically fit may improve your self-esteem, positive thinking, and ability to feel empowered, all of which will help you be more resilient. Try starting with something simple like taking a walk in the sunshine for twenty minutes a day; this activity has been proven to help people be more open-minded and ready to face challenges. It's important to unravel past motivations that feed into current approaches to life. Until you make peace with the hardships of the past, they may continue to influence and even direct your current responses. See setbacks and past issues as a chance to learn. Don't expect this to happen overnight but do tackle it; the end result will be a far more resilient self. Journaling about what happened and what you learned from it can help you come to terms with the past. See a therapist, a counselor, or your doctor if you cannot work through past issues alone. Think about past setbacks that made you feel like your life was over. See how you were able to work through them -- and to come out stronger on the other side. If you feel like you're missing closure on an event from your past, try to figure out what it will take to move on, such as confronting someone or visiting a place where you used to live. It isn't always possible to get closure, but there may be a way to change your thinking about the past so you can feel stronger when addressing future challenges. Summary:","completion":"This article says that to be mentally strong, it's important to take care of our body and mind. We should try to keep a normal routine, like taking showers and sleeping well. It's also helpful to think positively about ourselves and learn new skills. Being creative and physically active can make our mind stronger. We should also try to understand and learn from our past experiences. If we need help, we can talk to a professional, like a therapist. By doing all these things, we can feel happier and handle challenges better."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

They claim to be looking for a serial killer who strangles his victims and to need his help. Before he leaves, his landlady, who wants to marry him, gives him a small paper bag with pepper in it. Irmy (Farrow) and her boyfriend Paul (Malkovich), performers at a circus, are having a dispute about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where Marie, a tightrope artist (Madonna), waits for him. They begin to have sex, but Irmy catches them and runs away to the city. There, she meets a prostitute (Lily Tomlin) who brings her to a house of ill-repute, where she is comforted by other prostitutes (Jodie Foster and Kathy Bates). Then, a student named Jack (John Cusack) comes into the whorehouse and is immediately bewitched by Irmy; he insists on having sex with her, paying 700. On the street, Kleinman walks aimlessly around the city. He stops at a coroner's house, where the doctor (Donald Pleasence) explains that his role in the hunt is purely scientific. They each have a glass of sherry. After Kleinman leaves, the doctor is murdered by the Strangler. Kleinman, seeing a local family being evicted as 'undesirables', goes to the police station to try to stop the eviction. Whilst there, a police officer arrives with news of the coroner's death, saying that there is a clue â a glass with fingerprints on it. Kleinman panics, realizing that his fingerprints are on the glass. Irmy is there as well, because she had been taken to the police station when the police raided the whorehouse. Insisting she is a whore and needs a license, they fine her and allow her to leave. Irmy protests her innocence and, in the confusion, Kleinman is able to steal the glass with his fingerprints on it.

Nico Rosberg believes he can force Lewis Hamilton into making a crucial mistake in their Formula One title showdown on Sunday. Rosberg, who trails the British driver by 17 points, said: ‘I need some help from Lewis to clinch the title, and I am going to try to put as much pressure on him as I can. ‘He has been making some mistakes recently so maybe there is a chance.’ Nico Rosberg (right) believes he can beat Lewis Hamilton to the championship at the final race in Abu Dhabi. Rosberg claims that his Mercedes team-mate has been 'making some mistakes' recently. 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points. 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points. Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. The Brit must finish first or second at Yas Marina, where the final grand prix carries double points, to be certain of taking the title. Hamilton, who was slow to shake Rosberg’s hand at their press conference, insisted he would not use dirty games to win. He said: ‘We’re not children. We should know what is wrong and right.’ 'This is an extremely exciting moment for my career. 'I am fighting for the world championship at the last race, I have a good chance to win, and this is what I have been working towards since I began racing as a small child.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Nico Rosberg is gearing up for a decisive showdown against Lewis Hamilton at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. As the Formula One season comes to a close, all eyes will be on these two Mercedes team-mates, with Hamilton leading the championship by 17 points. Rosberg is well aware that he needs a strong performance, coupled with some assistance from potential mistakes by Hamilton, to clinch the title. Rosberg's claim that Hamilton has been making some recent mistakes could indicate psychological tactics aimed at pressuring his rival in the all-important final race. With double points on offer, the stakes are higher than ever. Hamilton needs to secure first or second place to guarantee a championship victory, while a Rosberg win is mandatory for him to have a chance at the title. Despite the intense rivalry and the pressure of performing on the biggest stage, both drivers have attempted to show restraint when it comes to playing mind games. Hamilton insisted that there would be no dirty tricks in his quest for the championship and emphasized the importance of fair play, stating, \\"We're not children. We should know what is wrong and right.\\" For Rosberg, this showdown is a culmination of a lifetime of dedication to racing.

Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three. From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian. The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance. Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation. Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own. Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans. In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world. In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine.

Which farmer didn't learn that aphids are resistant to organophosphates? Two farmers had different pests attacking their plants. John had a big aphid problem, so he used all the methods available to get rid of them. Mike had a slug problem, but had almost no aphides. Hint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.

Who's the woman behind this worldwide cosmetics empire ? Estee Lauder herself, of course. This businesswoman became, for a time, the world's richest self-made woman. Her secret? \\"I didn't get there by dreaming about it,\\" she would say. \\"I got there by doing it.\\" Estee was born in the early 1900s in Queens, New York. Her father ran a hardware store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products. So Estee \\"by accident\\" dropped a bottle of youth dew on the floor in the cosmetics department. As the _ spread around the store, customers came over and asked to buy it. The store soon began selling Estee's products. Estee led her company until 1982, when her son Leonard took over the business. Until her health worsened in the mid-1990s, she continued to attend the opening of a new store wherever in the world. She died on April 24, 2004. Estee Lauder's talent as a saleswoman was extraordinary. Her son Leonard said, \\"There was never anyone who could sell like she could.\\" All who worked for Estee appreciated her special talent.

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.

A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather was a prominent contributor to several studio albums by Michael Jackson, including Thriller, the best-selling album of all time.

He has been a member of the band ever since it began, and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring. Lukather's reputation as a guitarist and his association with Paich and the Porcaro brothers, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a steady flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s.

The Good, The Bad & The Outrageous Hugh Hefner And Crystal Harris Marry ||||| If your New Year's resolution was to find more reasons to believe in true love, you'll be thrilled to hear that two of the most romantic public figures in entertainment history have put aside their differences and acknowledged the truth that they are soul mates and meant to be together forever. For richer or ... well, richer. In sickness and in health. Until his death -- which, look, I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but the odds aren't on his side here -- does them part. I am of course talking about Hugh Hefner and Crystal Harris, who got married at the Playboy mansion on New Year's Eve. Oh, some might scoff at the fact that he's 86 and she's 26. Some might mention the cruel words about his sexual performance that Harris once confided on Howard Stern's radio show. But it's so incredibly obvious these two are the real deal, despite the bumpy road that led them to the altar. Hefner and Harris had marriage plans before, but like many young/ancient couples, things fell apart at the last minute. Five days before their lavishly-planned June 2011 garden party wedding before 300 guests, Hefner's blonde Playboy Playmate of the Month for December 2009 had what he described as a \\"change of heart.\\" At the time, Harris released her own statement, begging for the ex-couple to be left alone: After much deep reflection and thought I have decided to end my engagement with Hef. I hope the media will give each of us the privacy we deserve during this time. Interestingly, just days after her statement, a Funny or Die video was released in which Harris not only oh-so-cleverly lampooned the 60-year age gap between her and Hef, she proved her talented skills as a comedic actress, which are impressive indeed and not at all robotic and lifeless. In a tragic turn for Playboy magazine, the \\"Marrying Hef\\" issue Harris had posed for had to be altered at the last moment with a strategically-placed \\"Runaway Bride\\" sticker. But perhaps the biggest challenge of all for the couple lay in Hef's sexual abilities, which Crystal Harris told Howard Stern left something to be desired. Specifically, she said the sex “lasted like two seconds,\\" and added, Then I was just over it. I couldn’t even stay another couple days ... I couldn’t do it. I was like, ‘Ahhh.’ I just, like, walked away. Thankfully for all of us who were rooting for these crazy kids to make it, she eventually walked right back into his loving embrace. After, presumably, convincing herself that marrying an 86-year-old multi-millionaire was probably worth a sub-par sex life. As she wrote on Twitter this week, Today is the day I become Mrs. Hugh Hefner. Feeling very happy, lucky, and blessed. Indeed, Mrs. Hefner. Enjoy your wonderfully romantic, 100 percent sincere marriage for as long as it lasts! I'm sure you're hoping that won't be too many more years. The bride wore a \\"mermaid\\" gown.

We are not independent just yet, so that means when I go visit her I also see her siblings (both of which are pleasant, don't get me wrong). &amp;#x200B; The problem lies with how her 3 year old brother gets. Every time I visit, he's either crawled all up on her or between the two of us, and I hardly get time to cuddle or have physical interaction with my SO. It's been this way for a while, and it's starting to annoy me because I don't have a whole lot of time with her, and the time I manage to carve out I spend 2/3 of it with her little brother being the center of attention. I've brought it up to her before and she defends him by saying that he's only 3 and doesn't understand any better. My thinking though is if he doesn't understand any better, why not try to help him understand? Obviously in a way that can be digested easily by a 3 year old. &amp;#x200B; I get it, I genuinely do. I've had a really young sibling before and it's still fresh in my memory how much of a ball of energy they can be. I've had to explain to her (my sibling) what things are acceptable, and what things aren't (in a really simple/rudimentary and most importantly kind way that got across to her, more or less). But it still irks me a little that no action is taken and it's justified by saying he's 3. I just find it a kinda disheartening that I visit my girlfriend to spend time with her but it gets divided between me and someone that already sees her far more often than I do, but at the same time I feel invalidated because he's just a 3 year old and naturally wants to spend time with his sister.

Please answer the following question: Q: Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop what? Choices: - sensitivity - allergy - autonomy - immunity A: Answer:","completion":"Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity. A more detailed answer: Vaccination, also known as immunization, is a medical intervention that aims to protect individuals from infectious diseases by purposefully exposing their immune system to harmless or weakened parts of a specific pathogen. This exposure allows the immune system to recognize and remember the pathogen's threat, preparing it to respond more effectively and rapidly in the event of future encounters with the actual disease-causing microorganism. The primary function of vaccinations is to confer immunity. Immunity is the state in which an individual's immune system possesses enough knowledge and resources to effectively neutralize or eliminate a specific invading pathogen without causing significant harm to the host. This immunity can be categorized into two main types: active and passive. Active immunity is the long-lasting immunity that develops when a person's immune system is stimulated to produce an immune response, either through the natural course of infection or via vaccination. During this process, the immune system generates specialized proteins called antibodies, as well as cellular immunity, involving T cells that \\"remember\\" the pathogen's signature and signal for appropriate immune responses. This long-term memory and enhanced response form the basis of vaccination-based immunity. Passive immunity, on the other hand, is provided by the transfer of pre-formed antibodies, such as through breastfeeding or the administration of immune globulins (antibodies harvested from a pool of donors). This type of immunity is temporary and does not typically provide lasting protection. To sum up, vaccination serves as a preventive and protective measure that allows individuals to develop immunity against specific infectious diseases. By purposefully introducing tiny, harmless parts of pathogens or inactivated toxins into the body, the immune system is stimulated and \\"taught\\" to fight off these harmful invaders, ultimately providing long-term protection and reducing the spread of infectious diseases within communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, we can infer the following: Marcus Darell Cannon (born May 6, 1988) is an American football offensive tackle with the New England Patriots of the National Football League. Cannon has had a successful career with the Patriots since being drafted in 2011. As an offensive tackle, his primary role is to protect the quarterback and open running lanes for the running backs. He is a crucial part of the Patriots' offensive line, which plays a significant role in the team's success. At Texas Christian University, Cannon was a standout player who demonstrated excellent athleticism and skill. As a Horned Frog, he contributed to the team's success both on and off the field. His performance as an offensive tackle led to his recognition as one of the top prospects ahead of the 2011 NFL Draft. When the New England Patriots selected Cannon in the fifth round with the 138th pick, they were able to secure a valuable asset for their team. Throughout his career with the Patriots, Cannon has continued to develop his skills and has consistently contributed to the team's success.

Her manager, Addison, has expressed support for this application, which can be valuable in terms of boosting potential for success, as managers often have influence in these types of decisions, particularly if they will be working directly with the person in the new role. Given that they work closely together, this support suggests that Addison believes Sasha would excel in this role. The question proposed tries to ascertain what Sasha did post receiving Addison's support. If the answer is \\"thanked for the support,\\" this insinuates that Sasha has acknowledged this support with gratitude. It implies that she responded directly to Addison, expressing her appreciation for their backing. This response suggests Sasha values and respects Addison's opinion and that this endorsement has potentially increased her confidence in her ability to fulfil the duties in this potential new role. Sasha’s polite response of thankfulness is not only a professional courtesy but also could be seen as a strategic move in maintaining a positive rapport within the workspace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(November 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film opens with a home video of the slaughter with a captive bolt pistol of a pig on a European farm. The video rewinds to play the slaughter in slow motion, which emphasizes the hand-held barrel against the pig's fore-skull and the cartridge explosion. A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna, when they return home while the party is in progress. The host of the party, Eva, is their daughter who lives in another part of town and who has, it turns out in questioning of Benny after the incident, taken advantage of the planned absence of Georg and Anna to host the impromptu party in their home. While watching a newscast, Georg and Anna discuss the money Eva won in the pyramid scheme she was promoting at the party. In a locker room at school, Benny encourages his friends to take positions in his own Pilot and Passengers game. While his parents are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home.

Question: Are the Arabs able to maintain the public utilities? Movie plot title: Lawrence of Arabia Movie plot: In 1935, T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim (I. S. Johar) succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man.

With an Air-Kiss, Donald Trump Shows His Softer Side CLEVELAND — On most occasions when Donald J. Trump takes the stage, he exudes an air of unrivaled authority, dispatching protesters with the wave of a hand, clenching his fists for effect and, if necessary, squashing bugs that intrude on his air space. But during the third evening of the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump briefly cast away his tough image and gave a glimpse of his softer side. After Gov. Mike Pence, his running mate, spent nearly 30 minutes singing Mr. Trump’s praises, the Republican nominee appeared on the stage and extended his right arm for an embrace. The handshake morphed into a half-hug and then became something rarely seen among men in the political arena: an awkward air-kiss, initiated by Mr. Trump. Mr. Pence, a conservative from Indiana, initially seemed to pull away before giving a hearty laugh and a squeeze on the forearm. kiss, awkward, trump, donald trump, mike pence, awkward kiss, germaphobe #gif #meme #trendingmeme pic.twitter.com/xBtGMCbTpz Images of the exchange swirled around the internet, offering some levity in an evening that was otherwise consumed by the widening fissures of discord within the Republican Party. For body language experts, the moment was a sign of progress in the staid world of political backslapping. “It shows a completely different side to Trump,” said Lillian Glass, an authority on the psychology of human behavior and author of “The Body Language Advantage.” “It was a more loving, more affectionate, more caring side.” She added, “It shows he’s not afraid to express his emotions publicly, and he wasn’t afraid to kiss another man.” There have been suggestions that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence lack chemistry since they teamed up just over a week ago. However, the air-kiss appeared to be a sign that the Republican nominee was happy with his choice and appreciated how Mr. Pence vigorously defended his candidacy, particularly after Senator Ted Cruz’s lack of endorsement. “At a nonconscious level, Trump likely feels an unusually strong familial connection with the vice-presidential nominee,” said Kevin Hogan, another body language expert. “His brash demeanor took a side to what his true feelings are, which is likely to be deep appreciation, a moment of being rescued and an almost brotherly feeling toward his newest best friend.” Despite being notoriously anxious about germs, Mr. Trump is not a stranger to public displays of affection. In 2000, he kissed Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, who was dressed in drag for a skit. And he liberally gives out encouraging pats on the shoulder to strangers during his campaign travels. Ruth Sherman, a public speaking and presentation consultant, said that Mr. Trump’s comfort with air-kissing could be a cultural thing, harkening to his time working in the entertainment industry. The hesitant response from Mr. Pence, she said, was a sign that the ticket still needed time to mesh. “We both know that’s the way the celebrity crowd rolls in N.Y.C. and which Trump inhabits,” Ms. Sherman said. “Indiana, I would surmise, has an altogether different vibe.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation. Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles. Cole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was \\"responding well and recuperating\\" Thursday, her publicist said. Cole had been on what she called \\"a very long list\\" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match. It was a \\"directed donation\\" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone. \\"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,\\" Mone said. Directed organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said. The donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said. Cole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's \\"Larry King Live\\" on March 31. \\"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,\\" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. \\"I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body.\\" Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue. Cole won six Grammys for her 1991 critically acclaimed album \\"Unforgettable: With Love,\\" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album \\"Still Unforgettable\\" and another Grammy for her work on another album. Cole was still able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment. She canceled a planned show last week in South Korea because of her illness, which meant she was in Los Angeles when the organ became available. \\"I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's -- it's amazing,\\" Cole said. During King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated. King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole. \\"These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,\\" King said. Cole stared at the papers for a moment. \\"There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say,\\" Cole said. Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Natalie Cole, a renowned singer, underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Sunday held its first parliamentary elections under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, who was expected to use the polls and a newly elected legislature to elevate officials loyal to him and further consolidate his power. North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly has served as a rubber-stamp Parliament, endorsing whatever decisions were made by the top leader and his inner circles, who dominate the top echelons of the ruling Workers’ Party, the People’s Army and the government. In the last parliamentary election, held five years ago when Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, was still alive, a single candidate ran unopposed in each of the 687 districts, and all the deputies were elected with 100 percent support. The government reported voter turnout of 99.98 percent. The North Korean authorities run parliamentary elections as an effective political census, a chance to check up on the whereabouts and the political allegiance of citizens, as well as the ability of local Workers’ Party officials to mobilize residents. People pile into voting booths casting unmarked ballots in rapid succession. Those who oppose the state-selected candidate are supposedly allowed to pause to cross out the candidate’s name, effectively making the process a monitored event, according to defectors from the North. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some of the North Koreans who entered China and ended up defecting to South Korea after the famine in their home country in the mid-1990s have said they did so because they feared punishment back home for failing to show up for parliamentary elections. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un voted in Pyongyang North Koreans have been voting in a five-yearly election to approve members of the rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly. Each of the 687 districts had only one candidate running for office, with electors required to write only \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" on the ballot paper. Campaign posters across the capital, Pyongyang, urged a \\"Yes\\" vote. Observers say the candidate list is an opportunity to see who is in or out of favour with the leadership. Analysis The North Korean vote is a ritual, the result of which has already been largely determined. The Supreme People's Assembly meets rarely and has very little power but you would not know it from the official turnout. There is only one candidate for each district, and one name on each ballot paper. The democratic duty for the electorate is simply to write \\"Yes\\" beside it. Writing anything else might be seen as treachery, rather than democracy. That is especially true if you live in the district of Mount Paekdu - the constituency of current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. State media have devoted entire reports to the excitement of voters at the Mount Paekdu polling station, on seeing his name on the ballot paper. The only real value in these polls, analysts say, is in watching for any signs of change in the list of state-approved candidates. In the last election in 2009, turnout was 99%, with 100% of votes in favour of the given candidates. The election is the first to be held under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, who came to power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. Mr Kim was registered as a candidate in Mount Paekdu, venerated in party propaganda as the birthplace of Kim Jong-il. The leader was shown on state media casting his ballot in Pyongyang. The vote was held in a holiday atmosphere in the capital, Pyongyang, with performances taking place in the street. \\"Through this election we will fully display the might of the single-hearted unity of our army and people,\\" said Hyon Byong-chol, chairman of a preparatory committee for one of the sub-districts in the election. He told the Associated Press news agency that North Koreans were \\"firmly united\\" behind their leader. Pyongyang resident Ri Song-gun told AP he had cast his vote of approval for his district's candidate. Image copyright AP Image caption The election is the first to be held under the leadership of Kim Jong-un Image copyright AP Image caption Voters queued to cast their ballots - but there was only one choice on the ballot paper Image copyright Reuters Image caption Voting 'yes' to the named candidate is seen as the electorate's duty Image copyright Reuters Image caption Entertainment was laid on in the streets of the capital, and voters were encouraged to celebrate \\"I will devote all my intelligence and strength to fortify our socialist system centred on the masses, which was built and developed by our great generalissimos,\\" he said. The vote comes three months after the brutal and sudden execution of Mr Kim's once-powerful uncle, Chang Song-thaek.

The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. and the situation: Peter visited two mountain ranges last summer. The Ozarks in Missouri, and the Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more. Answer the following question: Which mountains have more caves?","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, I will analyze the information step-by-step to determine which mountains have more caves: 1. The background states that most cave systems are through limestone bedrock because of its solubility in water and weak acid solutions, leading to karst landscapes. 2. In the situation, Peter visited the Ozarks in Missouri and the Colorado Rockies last summer. 3. Peter loved both mountain ranges but enjoyed the cave systems and blue holes in the Ozarks more. From the given information, we can infer that the Ozarks have more caves since it has karst landscapes, and limestone is the primary bedrock associated with cave formation. Also, Peter's preference for the cave systems and blue holes in the Ozarks over the Colorado Rockies further suggests that the Ozarks have a more complex and abundant cave system. Therefore, the Ozarks have more caves than the Colorado Rockies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. I've seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. By taking Vonnegut's \\"voice\\" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.","completion":"This review is saying that the person liked both the book \\"Mother Night\\" and the movie version, but they think they are different. The writer enjoyed the movie because it didn't try to copy the book exactly, but instead focused on telling the story in a good way for a movie. The person thinks the movie is worth watching, even though it's not the best movie they've ever seen. So the sentiment of this review is mainly positive, as they liked the movie and thought it did a good job with the book's story."},{"prompt":"Choose your answer from: (1). follicles.

The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8 GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4 GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the MacBook (2015 version), which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the \\"Thunderbolt\\" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. The user begins by mentioning that they chose Green Cab based on good Yelp reviews and a nice website, which appears to be a positive sentiment. 2. However, the user's experience turned negative when the cab did not arrive on time, and the dispatcher was rude when they called. 3. The cab was late by a full half hour, going against the company's claim of a 15-minute window. This is another negative sentiment. 4. The user says the service \\"severely disappoints\\" and that they will never take Green Cab again, which are strong negative sentiments. Although the review starts with positive reasons for choosing the service, the majority of the content highlights negative experiences with Green Cab.

Please answer the following question: SAN FRANCISCO--The \\"Reading Wizard\\", an 11 - year - old - boy, whose offer to read to children without being paid at a local library was refused by libraries, will get to read to younger kids after all. Mayor Willie Brown last Wednesday ordered San Francisco Public Library officials to allow John O'Connor to read to preschool children to get them interested in books and stop them from watching television and video games. \\"I didn't expect this kind of attention. \\" John said, \\"It's just shocking.\\" John has chosen his first book, \\"The King's Giraffe\\", and made up fliers inviting neighborhood children, aged from three to six, to the Presidio Branch every Wednesday afternoon. He planned to call himself the \\"Reading Wizard\\" and wear a special hat, fake glasses and a black coat. But his idea was refused - on the phone, in person and finally with a letter from Toni Bernardi, the chief of the library's children and youth services. Using terms like \\"age appropriate material\\" ,she wrote that only library workers are allowed to read to children. John then went to a member of the city board of supervisors , who advised him to write letters to the library officials. \\"Our libraries are supposed to turn kids on, not to turn them off.\\" Brown said he enjoyed \\"the creative idea, the sense of civic duty and the caring for others that John clearly showed us.\\" By dressing up as a wizard, the boy probably hoped to_. A) put up a performance B) frighten the three - year - old boys C) get the officials shocked D) attract the children's attention A:","completion":"D) attract the children's attention The 11-year-old boy nicknamed \\"Reading Wizard\\" had a noble intention of getting younger children interested in books and reading while also steering them away from excessive television and video games consumption. By choosing to dress up as a wizard, complete with a special hat, fake glasses, and a black coat, John's primary goal was to attract the children's attention and make the reading sessions more enjoyable and engaging. The wizard costume, along with John's enthusiasm and passion for reading, would create an interactive and magical environment, encouraging the children to participate actively in the sessions and develop an interest in reading from a young age. This creative approach not only demonstrates John's concern for the younger generation's education but also highlights the importance of making reading fun and accessible to children. Unfortunately, John's idea was initially rejected by the library on the grounds that only library workers were allowed to read to children. However, with the intervention of Mayor Willie Brown, who recognized John's creativity, sense of civic duty, and caring for others, the young \\"Reading Wizard\\" was ultimately granted permission to read to preschool children at the Presidio Branch Library. In conclusion, dressing up as a wizard was a creative way for John to attract children's attention during the reading sessions. His ultimate goal was to help younger kids develop a love for reading and get them excited about exploring the world of books, and his imaginative approach was a clever way to achieve this objective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Let Shannon think he was backing down. Sentence 2: They wanted Shannon to think that he was giving up so that they could surprise him. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Step 1: Understand the sentences. The first sentence states that Shannon is being led to believe that someone or a group is backing down. The second sentence suggests that there's intent to deceive Shannon into thinking that he has been given up on, for the purpose of surprising him. Step 2: Compare the details in each sentence. The first sentence offers no information about surprising Shannon or an agenda to make him think he has been given up on, it merely presents the idea that Shannon thinks someone is backing down. The second sentence adds new details not present in the first one– specifically the motivation of deception and surprise. Step 3: Determine entailment. Entailment in linguistics means that the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. Here, the truth of the second sentence (their desire to surprise Shannon by making him think they've given up on him) is not guaranteed by the truth of the first sentence (Shannon thinking someone backs down).

The path to becoming a vicar is long, and the job itself is extremely demanding.","completion":"Step 1: Research the role of a vicar Before you embark on the journey to become a vicar, it is crucial to understand the responsibilities and expectations that come with this role. This may involve talking to current vicars, reading books or articles about their experiences, or attending seminars to deepen your understanding of the position. Step 2: Assess personal motivations and commitment Reflect on your reasons for wanting to become a vicar and ensure that you possess a strong, deep-rooted sense of calling and passion for ministry. As the job is demanding, it is crucial to be certain about your commitment to the role before embarking on this journey. Step 3: Complete necessary educational requirements To be eligible for ordination in most denominations, aspiring vicars must hold a bachelor's degree and a professional degree in divinity, theology or a related field. Ensure that you complete these educational prerequisites to increase your chances of being accepted into a seminary or a program leading to ordination. Step 4: Attend a seminary or training program Find a suitable seminary or training program that aligns with your beliefs and values, and that will provide you with the theological and pastoral education necessary to become a vicar. This may involve attending an accredited institution affiliated with your denomination, or completing a specialized training program that focuses on preparing candidates for ordained ministry. Step 5: Participate in supervised ministry experiences Many seminaries and training programs require aspiring vicars to complete field education or internships in a church or other ministry setting. These supervised ministry experiences provide an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills learned in the classroom while gaining practical experience in a real-world context. Step 6: Seek ordination from your denomination Upon completion of your theological education and supervised ministry experiences, approach the governing body of your denomination to seek ordination. Each denomination has its own specific requirements and processes for ordination, so it is important to be familiar with these details and complete any necessary steps. Step 7: Find a position as a vicar Once you are ordained, you can begin searching for a position as a vicar within your denomination. Networking with other clergy members, attending conferences and staying connected with your seminary or training program can help increase your chances of finding an available position. Step 8: Continue to develop professionally and spiritually As a vicar, it is important to prioritize your own spiritual growth and professional development to better serve your congregation. Take advantage of opportunities for continuing education, attend workshops and conferences, and engage in regular spiritual practices to remain connected to your faith and growth as a leader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The arts of Southeast Asia have affinity with the arts of other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience.

Coming off their last-second victory over the Bengals, the Broncos would play their Week 2 home opener against the Cleveland Browns. In the first quarter, Denver would trail early as Browns kicker Phil Dawson got a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Broncos took the lead as quarterback Kyle Orton completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Scheffler. Cleveland would creep close as Dawson made a 47-yard field goal, but Denver would answer as kicker Matt Prater got a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter. In the fourth, the Broncos pulled away as fullback Peyton Hillis got a 2-yard touchdown run and running back Correll Buckhalter got a 45-yard touchdown run. Answer this question: How many more yards was the longest touchdown compared to the shortest?","completion":"In this game, there were three touchdowns scored: 1. Quarterback Kyle Orton completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Scheffler. 2. Fullback Peyton Hillis got a 2-yard touchdown run. 3.

The longest touchdown was the 45-yard touchdown run by Correll Buckhalter, and the shortest touchdowns were the 2-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Orton to Tony Scheffler and the 2-yard touchdown run by Peyton Hillis. To find the difference in yards between the longest and shortest touchdowns, subtract the yardage of the shortest touchdown from the yardage of the longest touchdown: 45 yards (longest touchdown) - 2 yards (shortest touchdown) = 43 yards Therefore, the longest touchdown was 43 yards longer than the shortest touchdown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who died in 1917? , can you please find it? Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Development of Fruit and Fruit Types After fertilization, the ovary of the flower usually develops into the fruit. Fruits are usually associated with having a sweet taste; however, not all fruits are sweet. Botanically, the term “fruit” is used for a ripened ovary. In most cases, flowers in which fertilization has taken place will develop into fruits, and flowers in which fertilization has not taken place will not. Some fruits develop from the ovary and are known as true fruits, whereas others develop from other parts of the female gametophyte and are known as accessory fruits. The fruit encloses the seeds and the developing embryo, thereby providing it with protection. Fruits are of many types, depending on their origin and texture. The sweet tissue of the blackberry, the red flesh of the tomato, the shell of the peanut, and the hull of corn (the tough, thin part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn) are all fruits. As the fruit matures, the seeds also mature. Q: What type of seed-bearing structure of a flowering plant usually develop into?

He says that the Eskimos called the creature \\"bushman,\\" the Colville Indians \\"Sasquatch,\\" and the Hoopas \\"Om-mah,\\" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot. Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money. Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot. Marx travels above the Arctic circle, showing footage of the Northern lights while relating Bigfoot tales. He visits an Eskimo who promises he'll see Bigfoot. Later in the evening, he films what he describes \\"the shining eyes\\" of the creature, but when dawn comes, he says Bigfoot disappeared behind a rainbow. Marx shows footage of salmon spawning, geese migrating, caribou, and Alaska moose defending their territory. He searches from a plane and films a young Bigfoot near a river.

Read this: By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and plantations in the Caribbean. By the mid-19th century, \\"King Cotton\\" had become the backbone of the southern American economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of slaves. What was the difference that made American cotton preferred over Indian cotton? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The main difference that made American cotton preferred over Indian cotton was the quality of the cotton fiber itself due to the type of cotton plants. The domesticated native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense, produced cotton fibers that were longer and stronger than those obtained from Indian cotton. This superior quality allowed for smoother processing in mechanized British factories and the production of higher-quality textiles and goods, which further fueled the demand for American cotton. In addition to the quality difference, other factors that made American cotton more appealing included the lower cost and time associated with shipping the cotton from the United States and the Caribbean compared to shipping from India, which was a more expensive and time-consuming process. These factors, along with the expanding plantation system and the use of slave labor in the southern United States, contributed to the rise of \\"King Cotton\\" as the backbone of the southern American economy by the mid-19th century."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

(Photo: Jamie McCarthy, Getty Images for AOL) Rapper and actor Snoop Dogg is calling for a boycott of the new Roots miniseries in an expletive-filled social media post. In the video on Instagram and Twitter, Snoop Dogg rails about the remake of Roots, which premieres Monday as a four-night series on History, A&E and Lifetime channels. The remake is based on ABC's landmark 1977 miniseries of the same name, taken from author Alex Haley's 1976 novel, which explored the horrors of American slavery. \\"I'm sick of this. ...

Earlier, Roots co-executive producer LeVar Burton, who played the central character in the 1977 miniseries, enslaved protagonist Kunta Kinte, told USA TODAY that the remake was needed as part of a national discussion. \\"We are clearly engaged in the conversation in America and it's one where everybody needs to be involved,\\" Burton says. \\"If you are living in America right now, then the story of slavery is relevant to you, because it's shaped the country and the culture in which you live, whether you want to admit that or not.\\" (Photo: ABC) Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1sHlILq ||||| Snoop Dogg Snoop Dogg lambasts Roots remake: 'I can't watch it' Rapper says he is sick of films and TV shows that depict historical racial abuse against African Americans when they are still ‘taking the same abuse’ Snoop Dogg arrives at the premiere of Coach Snoop. Photograph: Jerod Harris/Getty Images The remake of Roots has gained widespread critical acclaim – but not from Snoop Dogg, who posted a short video on Instagram on Monday criticising the show, and suggesting that African Americans should not watch it. In the video, the rapper said that he was fed up with watching films and TV shows that depicted the abuse of black Americans. “12 Years a Slave, Roots, Underground, I can’t watch none of that shit,” Snoop Dogg said, also taking aim at the Steve McQueen-directed Oscar-winning film and the WGN TV series about slaves in Georgia escaping via an underground railroad, which was recently renewed for a second season.

Think about that part. Why don’t y’all go and make a muthafuckin’ series about the success that black folks is having?” The rapper is at least leading by example, with a current web series on AOL called Coach Snoop, which follows the Snoop Youth Football League. Snoop Dogg set up the league with the aim of getting inner-city children aged between five and 13 involved in football, and is its coach and commissioner. Roots, meanwhile, revisits one of the most successful shows in US television history for the Black Lives Matter era. British actor Malachi Kirby stars as enslaved Gambian warrior Kunta Kinte in the first episode, which aired in America on Sunday. The show is executive produced by LeVar Burton, who played Kunta Kinte in the original 70s miniseries, which was based on the book by Malcolm X biographer Alex Haley. Snoop Dogg concluded that he would not watch Roots, and advised his fans to avoid it. “Let’s create our own shit based on today, how we living and how we inspire people today. Black is what’s real.

The fight took place at the legendary Wembley Arena in London, where Selby demonstrated skill, resilience, and outstanding boxing technique, stopping his opponent through a technical knockout (TKO) in the seventh round. This victory further cements Selby's position as one of the rising talents in the world of boxing while outlining a promising future for the Welsh fighter. The Fight: From the very beginning of the match, Andrew Selby, brother of former world featherweight champion Lee Selby, looked comfortable and in control of the fight against his Filipino opponent, Jake Bornea. As Bornea sought to employ his aggressive style and land heavy punches, Selby showcased his defensive skills and footwork, repeatedly evading Bornea's attacks while effectively countering with his own. As the fight progressed, Selby's advantage over his opponent became increasingly evident. He managed to land clean, powerful shots, demonstrating his superior speed and accuracy, much to the frustration of Bornea. It was apparent that Selby had studied Bornea's fighting style meticulously, enabling him to predict and avoid the Filipino's flurries. Such discipline reinforced the notion that Selby possesses not only raw talent but also an important intellectual aspect to his boxing prowess. The Climax: It was only in the seventh round when the inevitable happened. Selby's relentless pressure and precise punching had taken its toll on Bornea, and a powerful combination sent the Filipino reeling to the canvas. Though Bornea managed to regain his footing, the referee wisely deemed him unfit to continue and called an end to the match, declaring Selby the winner via TKO. This victory not only earned Selby the vacant IBF Inter-Continental Flyweight Title but also proved, once again, that he is a force to be reckoned with in the world of boxing. With this win, Selby's professional record now stands at an impressive unbeaten streak. The Future: Having successfully captured the vacant IBF Inter-Continental Flyweight Title, Andrew Selby must now set his sights on further triumphs and challenges that await him. His ultimate goal will undoubtedly be to capture a world flyweight title, solidifying his status as one of the greatest fighters in the division.

As he continues further down the path to a world title, Selby will undoubtedly face increasingly difficult challenges and opponents. However, his recent performance has undoubtedly demonstrated that he possesses the talent, discipline, and sheer will to overcome whatever obstacles lie ahead.

What is the first name of the person whose colleagues demand be declared insane? Answer the above question based on the context below: Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse.

Despite a dismal performance four days earlier, Ryan Mallett was named the starter for the Texans. On the other side, Andrew Luck was inactive for the second week in a row, nursing a shoulder injury. Despite suffering from a viral infection, Matt Hasselbeck was named the starting quarterback for the Colts. Off to a promising start, Houston turned over the ball inside the red zone after a Mallett pass to Arian Foster was tipped and caught by Mike Adams. Indianapolis capitalized on the turnover with a 48-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri to take a 3-0 lead with 6:32 left in the 1st. The Colts further extended their lead with a 4-yard pass from Hasselbeck to former Texan Andre Johnson to lead 10-0 with 1:27 left in the first. Ending the 1st quarter, Houston trailed 0-10 with the ball on their own 34. On their second play of the 2nd quarter, the Texans punted the ball away on 4th and 1. Houston caught a break following a chop-block penalty against Frank Gore that made it 1st and 25 for Indianapolis near midfield. On 3rd and 22 a roughing the passer call against J. J. Watt gave the Colts a 1st down that put them in the red zone. On 3rd down Hasselbeck threw to T. Y. Hilton, who dropped the ball for an incomplete pass. After the play, Indianapolis head coach Chuck Pagano drew a 15-yard penalty after rushing the field. After a series of penalties, the Colts settled for a 42-yard Vinatieri field goal to lead 13-0 with 7:41 remaining in the half. A roughing the passer call against the Colts gave the Texans an automatic 1st down on what would have been 3rd down. After Mallett was slow to get up, Brian Hoyer came in at the quarterback position. On 3rd and 10 Hoyer picked up the 1st down passing 24 yards to DeAndre Hopkins. Hoyer connected with Hopkins once again to pick up a long 1st down conversion to put the Texans in the red zone. A chop block penalty pushed Houston back to the 31 for a 2nd and 21. Houston finally got on the board with a 36-yard field goal from Nick Novak to trail 3-13 with 2:08 left in the first half. With no timeouts left, Hoyer completed a 95-yard drive with a 42-yard Hail Mary pass to Jaelen Strong to trail 9-13. With Novak's kick good, Houston trailed Indianapolis 10-13 going into halftime. Receiving the ball to start off the first half, the Colts quickly marched down field to score a touchdown on the opening play. With 13:02 left in the 3rd, Indianapolis extended their lead to 20-10. The Texans were not as lucky as an offensive pass-interference call against Hopkins put Houston into a three-and-out. On the Colts' next possession Houston's defense forced them into their first 3-and-out of the night. On the Texans' next possession Hoyer connected with Strong once again for a touchdown. With Novak making the extra point, Houston trailed 17-20 with 4:03 left in the 3rd. Making their first 3rd conversion of the night, the Colts continued to march down the field to hold their 20-17 lead at the end of the 3rd. With a face-mask penalty called against Jadeveon Clowney, the Colts came closer to the Houston red zone. However, on the next play an offside penalty was called against Indianapolis. An interception was over-called following a holding penalty against Houston. On the next play the Texans were penalized again with a pass interference call against Kareem Jackson, making it 1st and goal from the Houston 1 for the Colts. Hasselbeck connected with Johnson to make it 26-17. With Vinatieri making the extra point, Indianapolis extended their lead to 27-17 with 10:28 left to play. Receiving the ball, Foster gained 32 yards to put Houston into Indianapolis territory, keeping hopes of a comeback alive. The Texans ended the drive with a 49-yard field goal from Novak to trail 20-27 with 6:07 left to play. Houston kicked the ball back to Indianapolis, who took the touchback. The Colts punted the ball back with 3:39 left to play, with the Texans returning it to their own 36. By the 2-minute warning Houston had reached Indianapolis territory at the Colts' 38. On the play following the 2 minute warning, Hoyer threw an interception that was picked off by Adams. Indianapolis held onto the ball and ran the clock out to win, 27-20.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun. Paragraph: Two high school buddies, Dan and Bob, had very different lifestyles 30 years later. Dan made only healthy lifestyle choices, was vegan. Bob ate meat, cheese and didn't care about his health and didn't protect himself. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which man was exposed to a higher risk of cancer, Dan or Bob? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bob was exposed to a higher risk of cancer compared to Dan, due to his unhealthy lifestyle choices and lack of concern for his health and protection. Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Dan's healthy lifestyle choices, including maintaining a vegan diet, seem to play a crucial role in keeping him at a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer. Following a plant-based diet like veganism can provide numerous health benefits, as it is typically low in saturated fats and high in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, which may help reduce the risk of cancer. On the other hand, Bob's lifestyle is characterized by unhealthy habits such as consuming meat and cheese, which have been associated with a higher risk of certain cancers. Diets high in red and processed meats, for example, have been linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Moreover, the consumption of high-fat dairy products, such as cheese, may be linked to some types of cancers, like prostate cancer. Furthermore, the paragraph explicitly mentions that Bob did not care about his health and did not protect himself, suggesting that he may not be taking the necessary precautions with the exposure to various carcinogens in his environment. If Bob is careless about using sunscreen or avoiding activities such as tanning beds or smoking, he increases his risk of skin and lung cancer, respectively, among other types of cancer. In summary, Bob's diet and lack of concern for his health and protection make him more likely to be exposed to a higher risk of cancer than Dan, who actively makes healthy lifestyle choices, including having a vegan diet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Statue of Liberty National Monument is located in the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York. 2. It comprises Liberty Island and Ellis Island. 3. It includes Liberty Enlightening the World, commonly known as the Statue of Liberty, situated on Liberty Island. 4. It also includes the former immigration station at Ellis Island which opened in 1892 and closed in 1954. From this information, we can conclude that the Statue of Liberty is situated on Liberty Island, not on Ellis Island. Although both islands are part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, they are distinct entities with different historical significance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said in a statement that the Court of Cassation’s ruling was the last level of appeal in a case that began in mid-2016 when Rajab was arrested over tweets suggesting that security forces had tortured detainees in a prison. Rajab a leading figure in pro-democracy protests that swept Bahrain in 2011 was convicted last year of making “false or malicious” statements about authorities in Bahrain. The charges arose from a January 2015 interview cited by the prosecution in which he was alleged to have said that Bahrain was holding political prisoners who were subject to torture. Amnesty International called Rajab ’s imprisonment “a flagrant violation of human rights and an alarming sign that the Bahraini authorities will go to any length to silence criticism”. The U.N. human rights office last year called on Bahrain to “unconditionally and immediately” release Rajab .

Answer the following question: Given the below context: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing... Guess a valid title for it!

Morgan lives in a world where everyone else has been infected by a plague that has turned them into undead, vampiric creatures that cannot stand sunlight, fear mirrors, and are repelled by garlic. They would kill Morgan if they could, but fortunately, they are weak and unintelligent. At night, Morgan locks himself inside his house; during the day, he kills as many vampires as he can, burning the bodies. A flashback sequence explains that, three years before, Morgan's wife and daughter had succumbed to the plague, before it was widely known by the public that the dead would return to life. Instead of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his daughter's corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him, Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is immune to the bacteria because he was bitten by an infected vampire bat when he was stationed in Panama, which introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood. One day, a dog appears in the neighborhood. Desperate for companionship, Morgan chases after the dog, but does not catch it. Some time later, the dog appears, wounded, at Morgan's doorstep. He takes the dog into his home and treats its wounds, looking forward to having company for the first time in three years.

Story highlights Paul Craig Cobb has been trying to turn Leith into a white nationalist community The National Socialist Movement plans to have meeting in Leith on Sunday Leith residents are watching developments with concern The town's lone black resident and his wife feel threatened and uncertain A tranquil town in North Dakota could lose its serenity if one man has his way. Paul Craig Cobb wants to transform Leith, population 24, into a community that mirrors his white supremacist views. This weekend, white supremacists and others are expected to descend on the town in a show of support for him. Cobb said he envisions Leith as a place where white nationalist banners will be flown, where white culture would be celebrated, and where minorities would not be welcome. His white power takeover would begin with getting political control over Leith. But his ambitions go way beyond this one small town. Cobb said he wants this movement to spread to other communities, other nations, even around the world, though he does not explain how he would do this. \\"I don't understand why all the different other people don't say 'whitey' is pretty darn nice and clever,\\" Cobb said. \\"There are many organizations (in) which whites have to support other cultures... Where is the organization of people from around the world that says let's keep these white people?... They're pretty darn good, all in all.\\" Cobb is one of the best known white supremacists in North America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. \\"He believes whites should be separate from other races,\\" said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center. \\"He's also an anti-semite, a raging anti-semite... And he's a member of the creativity religion, which is a religion that literally worships the Aryan man instead of God.\\" Cobb's quest to change Leith began about two years ago with the purchase of property. Leith, a quiet town where you can hear the crickets chirp and the grain elevator run, is 70 miles southwest of Bismarck. It is part of Grant County, North Dakota's third largest county by land mass at more than 1 million acres, according to its website. The communities there once buzzed with activity from nearby railroads, but all that is gone. Cobb, 61, said he picked Leith because it was beautiful and cheap. He has bought 12 plots of land for as little as 500 each. He wants like-minded people affiliated with white nationalist organizations to take up residence on his properties. \\"We hate that which threatens what we love,\\" he said. \\"And we're being genocided in our own country. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you be bitter about it?\\" Reaction of other residents Other residents of Leith are trying to make sense of the developments. \\"It is very shocking, because I didn't ever know groups like this existed,\\" said Mayor Ryan Schock, who has lived in the town his whole life. Miller Ferrie, a Leith resident for seven years, said the town's peace has been shattered. \\"It saddens us, because of what they stand for,\\" she said. \\"If they were coming to hold a rally for Christ we would be thrilled, but what they stand for is the opposite of what we believe.\\" Leith's lone black resident, Bobby Harper, feels under threat. Harper's wife said she has received messages from hate groups calling for her to leave her husband and join Cobb's movement. \\"It made me afraid,\\" Sherill Harper said. \\"If his goal is to just have only white people here, where do my husband and I go?\\" Bobby Harper said he had no plans to leave, even if Cobb's supporters came in and started controlling the town. The sheriff of Grant County said he is keeping a close eye on the situation. \\"I'm a firm believer that everyone has a right to believe what they want, just not the ability to force the issue on someone else,\\" said Steven Bay, also a lifetime resident of Grant County. He said because Cobb has not broken the law, there is not much he can do. Bay has talked to Canadian authorities several times, because Cobb is a wanted man in Canada -- where he faces hate speech charges over a blog. \\"They're not going to extradite,\\" Bay said. \\"It's not a crime for which they will extradite someone from the U.S. back to Canada.\\" Town hall meeting This Sunday the National Socialist Movement, a white supremacist group, will hold a meeting in Leith. On its website, the group calls the gesture a show of goodwill \\"as we plant the seeds of national socialism in North Dakota.\\" Jeff Schoep, the commander of the movement, who claims to have property in Leith, wrote an open letter to Leith's mayor announcing the group's decision to head to Leith on September 22 and 23 in a show of support for Cobb. He said Cobb's efforts are a chance to revitalize the community. Nationalist online message boards such as WhiteNations.com and Stormfront have also applauded Cobb for \\"doing a great job\\" and jibing critics as \\"laughable.\\" Anti-racist activists are also expected to descend on Leith this weekend. One of this effort's organizers told the Bismarck Tribune that he and others are hoping people will join them for a peaceful show of solidarity. Meanwhile, town and county officials said they would consider extreme measures to avoid Leith being taken over by white supremacists. Mayor Schock said he would consider dissolving the city in order to save the city. But he hopes it doesn't come to that. Meanwhile, is there anything that would persuade Cobb to depart the town? If the government decides the \\"send four dozen Somali families to Leith,\\" Cobb said, that would convince him to leave. ||||| This Tiny Town Is Trying To Stop Neo-Nazis From Taking Over i i itoggle caption Kevin Cederstrom/AP Kevin Cederstrom/AP A white supremacist has plans to take over a tiny town in North Dakota and turn it into one for whites only. This weekend, members of one of the nation's largest neo-Nazi organizations will descend upon the town in a step toward making that vision a reality — and several residents are trying to stop them. Leith, N.D., which sits 3 miles off the nearest paved road, has been in decline for decades. The railroad, schools and most of the town's businesses and residents are gone. Many buildings are held together by rotting boards and slabs of concrete. At the urging of residents, the county health department has condemned several of the structures. It's part of an effort to stop Craig Cobb, a white supremacist, from easily moving in others like him to take over the town and its small local government. Bobby Harper, who lives right across an alleyway from Cobb, is the only black resident in the town of 24 people. He says he was prepared to tolerate Cobb as long as he kept to himself, but he's angry now that Cobb has invited other white separatists to join him. i i itoggle caption Meg Lindholm/Prarie Public Broadcasting Meg Lindholm/Prarie Public Broadcasting \\"He knows that those people that he's inviting to this town are full of hate,\\" Harper says. \\"He's bringing his people in that doesn't like me just because of my race, and that's not the way it should be.\\" When Cobb moved to Leith last year, he had already purchased 12 properties. He's given most of them away to people who are notorious in the white separatist movement. He gave one to a former Ku Klux Klan leader and another to Jeff Schoep, leader of one of the nation's largest neo-Nazi organizations, the National Socialist Movement. Cobb invited Schoep and NSM members to visit Leith for two days, starting this Sunday, to showcase his vision of an all-white community. He says he wants to install flags of the \\"formerly white nations of Europe.\\" \\"It would be extraordinarily beautiful when people enter the town, particularly at night,\\" Cobb says. \\"We will probably have the National Socialist hunting flag with stag horns and a very small swastika in the center — very discreet.\\" Cobb's plans don't end in Leith. He also wants to take over other towns roughly adjacent to the state's oil fields, like one near the Canadian border called Alkabo. \\"A little bit like 'al-Qaida' but 'Alkabo,' \\" he says with a laugh. Gregory Gordon, a law professor at the University of North Dakota, says he doesn't think Cobb is necessarily dangerous but that he should not be underestimated. \\"I don't think we should take him lightly, because he is very much into glorifying and promoting violence against racial minorities,\\" Gordon says. i i itoggle caption Kevin Cederstrom/AP Kevin Cederstrom/AP But, he says, laws like the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 that prohibit discrimination in housing opportunities will very likely put a brake on Cobb's all-white vision. Still, the residents of Leith aren't feeling hopeful. Several say their best chance of saving their town may be to legislate it out of existence. They are considering dissolving the town's council and transferring control to the county. It's a painful choice, says longtime resident Bethany Haberstroh. \\"It's sad seeing a town die off, but what's heartbreaking is to see a town struggling with the decision of dissolving its government because an extreme hate group is wanting to take over,\\" she says. Meanwhile, Harper, Cobb's across-the-alley neighbor, says he won't be driven out. \\"They gotta do something very drastic to make it very unsafe and uncomfortable for me. Right now, I don't see it happening,\\" he says. A protest against Cobb and the National Socialist Movement is also being planned for this weekend. The town's mayor says his fervent hope is for peace on both sides. ||||| BISMARCK, North Dakota Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in the tiny North Dakota town of Leith on Sunday to protest plans by an American Nazi group to move in and take over the local government. The loud but peaceful demonstrators, many of them Native Americans from nearby reservations, were on hand for a visit from Jeff Schoep, commander of the National Socialist Movement, and several followers. The National Socialist Movement is America's largest neo-Nazi organization, founded in 1974 by former members of the American Nazi Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The group hopes to move enough members into Leith - population 17 - to take over the local government. \\"We have to start somewhere,\\" Schoep told Reuters. \\"So if we start in small towns and spread out from there, it's sort of a test ground in that sense, where if we're able to get off the ground here, then we're able to get off the ground in other places.\\" Schoep and his followers were in Leith on Sunday to survey property purchased for them by local resident Craig Cobb, whose yard is adorned with swastika flags. Local officials oppose the group's plans. Leith Mayor Ryan Schock said city officials were discussing the possibility of unincorporating the city and turning it back over to the county to scuttle the hate group's plans. \\"This is a small, quiet town,\\" Schock said. \\"Families live around here, and it's a very close-knit community. I really wish it hadn't gotten to this point.\\" The protesters, shouting slogans like \\"Go Home\\" and \\"No Hate in Our State,\\" included more than 200 Native Americans from the nearby Standing Rock Reservation, as well as other reservations from North and South Dakota. Members of the Grant County Sheriff's Department were joined by deputies from several surrounding counties. More than a dozen North Dakota Highway Patrol officers also turned out in riot gear, but no violence was reported, officials said. For more than a year, Cobb, a white supremacist activist, has been buying up properties in Leith and inviting his fellow supremacists to move in and set up a \\"Pioneer Little Europe,\\" as some supporters have called it, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. In a recent interview with KXMB-TV in Bismarck, Cobb said he had gotten a lot of offers to buy up land from what he termed like-minded people who believe white people should not be punished for wanting to live near each other. \\"It's fine for all these other minorities, but not us,\\" he said in the televised interview. \\"If you merely speak about it, you're going to be defamed in this country.\\" Cobb's plans were revealed in August after the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center published a report detailing his land purchases in Leith, which is located in a county that is 97 percent white. The center's report also cited county tax and property records showing that other leading supremacists, in addition to the National Socialists, had followed his lead, including Tom Metzger, leader of the White Aryan Resistance, and Alex Linder, who runs the Vanguard News Network, an online forum for the neo-Nazis. State health department officials said recently that they were considering condemning Cobb's property over health code issues related to an outdoor toilet in Cobb's yard. Cobb said he would fight the health department in court if necessary.

Read this: Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain (Andalusia) by the Moors, another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians. There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims, and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo’s royal Cappella Palatina, dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140. His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (1194 - 1250) continued integrating Muslims into his court, including Moorish musicians. By the 14th century, lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and, probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor, based in Palermo, the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Ford Island continues to be used by the US Navy. It hosts the 34,000-square-foot (3,200 m2) Pacific Warfighting Center for exercises, training and battle simulations. The Admiral Clarey Bridge enabled the Navy to develop a 331 million Pacific tsunami warning center named after Senator Daniel Inouye, replacing the aging facility on ʻEwa Beach. The center's location is controversial because of its location in a tsunami-vulnerable area and the Navy's tsunami-evacuation plan calls for the island's only access point—the Admiral Clarey Bridge—to be opened for ship evacuation (making the bridge inaccessible to land vehicles). The island also continues to host a military brig.Nominally based in Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for maintenance and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly 1,000,000,000, has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.In 2013, the Navy unveiled a 4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island. The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) was developed to save on training costs with a reusable facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of real-world training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.

Article: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict. The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made \\"extraordinary progress\\" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years. However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. \\"As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics.\\" concludes the report. The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct. In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy. Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. \\"While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics...

The given premise and hypothesis are essentially contrasting statements rather than connected logical implications. To further elaborate, let's break down the statements and understand their meanings: Premise: \\"He went on to say that these clinics fill a critical need.\\" This statement implies that someone (presumably an expert or an individual with knowledge about the subject) believes and claims that these particular clinics are crucial in fulfilling a significant demand or addressing a pressing issue. Consequently, the premise supports the idea that these clinics are useful and play a vital role in meeting the community's or patients' needs. Hypothesis: \\"The clinic fails to fill any needs.\\" This statement asserts that the clinic is not successful in catering to any requirements or satisfying the intended purpose. In stark contrast to the premise, the hypothesis claims that these clinics are ineffective in addressing the problems they are supposed to solve. Upon examination of the two statements, it is evident that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, they convey opposing ideas regarding the clinics' effectiveness and relevance. The premise portrays the clinics as essential solutions that address critical needs, while the hypothesis negates their value altogether, leaving no room for a logical connection between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I, in my entire academic life, have never been careless towards the submission. I always submitted reports or assignments before time. Anyway, the submission day finally arrived. I had told one of the group members to print the report out and bind it and bring to the college with her. The lecture is scheduled at 2:00 pm. I called her for about 30 times asking where she was. She didn’t pick up any of our calls. There she entered the lecture hall at 2:07 pm and our professor being a strict one, rejected our project. Everything was washed out. Our efforts were washed away.

In a statement released by the office of the UN Secretary General, the top UN official conveyed his sincere concerns over the alarming hostage situation that unfolded in a remote area of Peru. The incident, which led to an escalated tension in the region, is a grave violation of human rights and international humanitarian law, prompting swift and unequivocal disapproval from the United Nations. While the specific details of the incident are still being investigated, reports suggest that an armed group took over a facility in a secluded location in Peru, taking multiple hostages in the process. The motives behind the act are not yet clear, but it has caused significant concern and sparked fears of potential harm to the hostages and the surrounding community. The UN Secretary General's statement emphasized that such actions are entirely unacceptable and must be condemned in the strongest terms. The world body upholds the respect for human rights, dignity, and the fundamental freedoms of all individuals around the globe. The statement went on to say that taking hostages not only violates these fundamental principles but also poses a severe threat to peace and social stability in the affected region. The United Nations has been actively involved in addressing similar incidents in the past, working consistently to ensure the swift and peaceful resolution of hostage situations and to secure the release of innocent individuals. Moreover, the UN stands ready to provide support and assistance to the Government of Peru in its efforts to resolve the crisis, emphasizing that the protection of civilians must be the foremost priority. As the situation in Peru unfolds, it is essential to underline the crucial role of the international community in condemning such violent acts and collaborating to prevent any further occurrences. The UN Secretary General asserted the need for a concerted effort by all relevant stakeholders, including governments and regional organizations, to tackle the broader issues of violence and criminal activities that may fuel such incidents. By addressing the root causes and strengthening the collaboration at all levels, the international community can effectively combat hostage-taking and similar violent crimes. The hostage situation in Peru is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges we face in ensuring the safety and security of our global community. With the robust condemnation of such acts by the UN Chief, the message is loud and clear - hostage taking and similar human rights violations will not be tolerated, and all necessary measures will be taken to hold the perpetrators accountable and protect innocent lives. The United Nations calls upon all parties involved to ensure the safe and expedited release of the hostages and urges for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. The world stands in solidarity with the people of Peru during this challenging time, demanding an end to such heinous acts and reaffirming the unwavering commitment to uphold human rights and safeguard the dignity of every individual worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

B2Space and Snowdonia Aerospace Centre want to create 93 specialist jobs at Llanbedr airfield, Gwynedd. The number is based on it launching 30 satellites a year by 2020 for purposes including tracking changes to the environment and coastlines. The former military airfield is also one of eight shortlisted by the UK government to launch commercial space flights. B2Space's Valentin Canales said about 3,000 micro satellites will need launching in the next five years as we \\"use space in a way that hasn't been considered before\\". His firm and the aerospace centre have bid for grants totalling £10m to make the field, near Harlech, a key UK site for this. Other possible uses for them include providing communications to remote areas or for natural disaster management. \\"Wales is already a centre of excellence for aerospace manufacturing and has the physical and intellectual infrastructure to support the growing space market,\\" said Mr Canales. His firm will relocate from Bristol to Llanbedr if the project is successful in providing people, companies and organisations with access to small satellites. A spokesman for the Snowdonia Aerospace Centre said the development of a low-cost satellite launch operation will be a catalyst for innovation and jobs. \\"The project has the potential to attract technology, research, and investment from around the world,\\" added John Idris Jones, chairman of Snowdonia Enterprise Zone. \\"The development means lots of opportunities for the north Wales supply chain and will provide a real boost to the wider Wales space sector.\\" Llanbedr has also bid to become the UK's first commercial passenger spaceport and bids for £10m funding were submitted to the UK Space Agency in April.

Classical Greek genres included philosophy, poetry, historiography, comedies and dramas. Plato and Aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of Western philosophy, Sappho and Pindar were influential lyric poets, and Herodotus and Thucydides were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.

Q:Alexiev and Sabrina were enthusiastic chemistry students completing the first experiment of their new course. They both started the experiment with pure water, and had to perform different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. At the end of the experiment, both of them measured the concentration of hydronium ions present in their reaction mixtures.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, has a higher pH value at the end? Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar?

Henry Hill, Jr. was born on June 11, 1943 in Manhattan, New York, to Henry Hill, Sr., an Irish immigrant and electrician, and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian. The working-class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings who grew up in Brownsville, a poorer area of the East New York section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job. On April 27, 1980, Hill was arrested on a narcotics-trafficking charge. He became convinced that his former associates planned to have him killed: Vario, for dealing drugs; and Burke, to prevent Hill from implicating him in the Lufthansa Heist. Hill heard on a wiretap that his associates Angelo Sepe and Anthony Stabile were anxious to have him killed, and that they were telling Burke that Hill \\"is no good\\", and that he \\"is a junkie\\". Burke told them \\"not to worry about it\\". Hill was more convinced by a surveillance tape played to him by federal investigators, in which Burke tells Vario of their need to have Hill \\"whacked.\\" But Hill still wouldn't talk to the investigators. While in his cell, the officers would tell Hill that the prosecutor, Ed McDonald, wanted to speak with him, and Hill would yell: \\"Fuck you and McDonald\\". Hill became even more paranoid because he thought Burke had officers on the inside and would have him killed. While Karen was worried, she kept getting calls from Jimmy Burke's wife, Mickey, asking when Hill was coming home, or if Karen needed anything. Hill knew the calls were prompted by Jimmy. When Hill was finally released on bail, he met Burke at a restaurant they always went to. Burke told Hill that they should meet at a bar Hill had never heard of or seen before, owned by \\"Charlie the Jap\\". However, Hill never met Burke there; instead they met at Burke's sweatshop with Karen and asked for the address in Florida where Hill was to kill Bobby Germaine's son with Anthony Stabile. Hill knew he was going to get killed in Florida, but he needed to stay on the streets to make money. McDonald didn't want to take any chances and arrested Hill as a material witness in the Lufthansa robbery. Hill then agreed to become an informant and signed an agreement with the United States Department of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force on May 27, 1980. In 2011, former junior mob associate Greg Bucceroni alleged that, after Hill's 1980 arrest, Jimmy Burke offered him money to arrange a meeting between Bucceroni and Hill at a Brooklyn grocery store so that Burke could have Hill murdered gangland fashion, but Bucceroni decided quietly against having any involvement with the hit on Hill. Shortly afterwards, Burke and several other Lucchese crime family members were arrested by federal authorities.

The photograph, taken amid Vancouver's hockey riots, has been tweeted around the world. But the photographer who took it is still not sure what the picture really shows. Canada-based photojournalist Richard Lam took the photograph while covering the riots that followed the Vancouver Canucks' 4-0 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup. The photographer was being buffeted by rioters and riot police when he spotted the couple. \\"I was about 20 or 30 yards away,\\" he said. \\"There were these two people on the ground in this empty street. Initially I thought one of them was hurt.\\" He took a few shots and then the moment was lost. \\"It was complete chaos.

After I stopped running, I noticed in the space behind the line of police that two people were lying in the street with the riot police and a raging fire just beyond them. \\"I knew I had captured a 'moment' when I snapped the still forms against the backdrop of such chaos but it wasn't until later when I returned to the rink to file my photos that my editor pointed out that the two people were not hurt, but kissing.\\" \\"Everyone has been asking who they are,\\" said Lam but he has no idea and never had the opportunity to speak to them.

Rioting and looting left cars burned, stores in shambles and windows shattered over a roughly 10-block radius of the city's main shopping district. Police Chief Jim Chu said nine officers were injured, including one who required 14 stitches after being hit with a thrown brick. Chu said some officers suffered bite marks. He said 15 cars were burned, including two police cars. He called those who incited the riot \\"criminals and anarchists\\" and said officers identified some in the crowd as the same people who smashed windows and caused trouble through the same streets the day after the 2010 Winter Olympics opened in 2010. \\"These were people who came equipped with masks, goggles and gasoline,\\" he said. \\"They had a plan.\\" Chu said those who stood by and filmed and cheered also bear some responsibility. Assistant Fire Chief Wade Pierlot said people had to be rescued from rooftops and bathrooms where they had hidden for safety. He said some people moved burning dumpsters away from buildings to prevent further damage. • This article was amended on 17 June 2011 to insert an update. ||||| Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse the slideshow First things first—how amazing is this photo?

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - A rookie is a person in his or her first year of a sport, or someone who is new to a profession, training or activity such as a rookie police officer, rookie pilot, a recruit, or occasionally a freshman. - The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (often shortened as the Bucs) are a professional American football franchise based in Tampa, Florida.

Angered upon not being invited to the christening, Maleficent curses the princess, proclaiming that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of an enchanted spinning wheel and die. After Maleficent leaves, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that Aurora instead will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's first kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they take Aurora away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest, living as mortals, until the day of her sixteenth birthday. Years later, Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, has grown up into a beautiful young maiden.

As a result, he lacked the necessary confidence and deep understanding of the software in order to effectively transfer knowledge to others. His limited exposure to the program made it difficult for him to navigate through its features, troubleshoot common issues, and tailor his teaching approach to accommodate the varying levels of technical skills possessed by the learners. On the other hand, Joseph was more confident in his ability to teach the new computer program due to his extensive experience with it. This prior experience allowed him to have a deeper understanding of the program's functionalities and how it can be best applied in different scenarios. Joseph was also better equipped to address any doubts or questions raised by the learners, as he had likely encountered and resolved similar issues in the past. Moreover, Joseph's familiarity with the software enabled him to adapt his teaching methodology to suit the individual needs of his audience more efficiently. This adaptability is crucial in ensuring that learners remain engaged in the learning process, leading to better outcomes and increased satisfaction. Joseph's confidence also played a pivotal role in creating a positive learning environment, as his assurance was contagious and helped put the learners at ease. In addition to the difference in experience levels, Benjamin may have also felt uncomfortable teaching the new computer program due to a lack of adequate training resources or support from his superiors. This lack of guidance might have left Benjamin feeling overwhelmed and underprepared, further exacerbating his apprehension. In contrast, Joseph may have had access to relevant training materials, mentors, or a community of users who could provide him with the technical and emotional support needed to master the new computer program and translate that mastery into teaching others effectively. This support system can make a significant difference in easing the discomfort associated with taking on new and unfamiliar responsibilities. In conclusion, the difference in comfort levels between Benjamin and Joseph when it comes to teaching the new computer program can be attributed to the disparity in their experience levels with the software and the potential difference in resources and support provided on their respective learning journeys. To overcome this gap, Benjamin may need to invest more time and effort in mastering the program, capitalize on available resources, and seek out support networks to empower him to become a more confident and effective teacher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lestat The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Create the main characters First, we need to establish our main characters. Lestat is our protagonist, a vampire with a complex personality, seeking meaning and purpose in his immortal existence. Akasha is the powerful and seductive ancient vampire queen, who ultimately becomes the object of Lestat's fascination and desire. Step 2: Establish the setting The movie plot will be set in a world where vampires secretly live among humans, with their own set of rules and social hierarchies. The story would primarily take place in two locations: a modern, bustling city where Lestat currently resides, and an ancient hidden kingdom where Akasha has been dormant for centuries. Step 3: Create the initial conflict Lestat, bored and disillusioned by his current lifestyle, comes across a centuries-old myth about Akasha, the powerful and beautiful ancient queen of vampires. Intrigued by the legend and yearning for something more meaningful in his life, Lestat becomes obsessed with finding and awakening Akasha. Step 4: Introduce additional characters and subplots To add depth and complexity to the movie plot, we will incorporate secondary characters and subplots. These might include a love interest for Lestat, who becomes threatened and jealous of his infatuation with Akasha, as well as other vampire factions with differing motivations who either support or oppose Lestat's quest. Step 5: Further develop the main plot As Lestat gets closer to finding Akasha's hidden resting place, he encounters various obstacles and challenges, forcing him to confront his own fears and weaknesses. These struggles can include fights with rival vampires, navigating the complexities of vampire politics, and ultimately discovering that he must pay a heavy price to awaken Akasha. Step 6: The climax Lestat finally locates and awakens Akasha, instantly becoming spellbound by her allure, power, and wisdom. However, her return to power disrupts the delicate balance between humans and vampires, leaving the world on the brink of chaos and destruction. Lestat finds himself struggling between his infatuation with Akasha and his loyalty to his own kind, ultimately facing the difficult choice of whether to stand with her or oppose her. Step 7: The resolution In the end, Lestat realizes that Akasha's vision of the world threatens to destroy everything he has come to value, including his love interest and long-standing friendships. In a final, epic confrontation, Lestat uses his cunning, determination, and sheer force of will to stop Akasha, sacrificing their connection. In doing so, he redefines his role in the vampire world and discovers a newfound purpose to his immortal existence. The answer to the question \\"Who becomes spellbound by Akasha?\\" is: Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha, as he is deeply fascinated and entranced by her power and beauty. His obsession with her drives the central conflict of the movie plot, forcing him to question his loyalties, overcome personal challenges, and ultimately make a difficult choice to save his world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(October 2015) Mary Katherine Gallagher (Shannon) is an Irish-American Catholic school girl and social outcast in her high school. She wants to be a superstar so she can get a kiss from Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell). When Mary is sent to Special Education because of hyperactivity, she makes a new best friend, the tomboyish and equally socially awkward Helen Lewengrub (Emmy Laybourne). Mary sees her chance to become a superstar when her school promotes a talent show. She wants to try out, but Grandma Gallagher (Glynis Johns) will not let her. Mary tries out anyway and, when she goes to sign up, a stereotypical cheerleader, Evian Carrie Graham (Elaine Hendrix), gets in a fight with her. The fight causes Evian and Sky to break up, and now Sky is a \\"single hunk of beefcake on the rebound\\". Mary is now determined to get in the talent show so Sky will notice her. When Grandma Gallagher finds out that her granddaughter got into the talent show, she finally tells the truth about how her parents died â they were stomped to death while performing in a Riverdance-like competition, rather than being eaten by Hammerhead sharks as her grandmother had told her. This is why Grandma Gallagher is against her granddaughter performing. However, Grandma Gallagher decides to help Mary do her act in the talent show, as long as she performs for herself. Mary and the other Special Education students spend days practicing. Mary wins the competition as well as Sky's heart. When she kisses Sky though, she discovers he is a horrible kisser and chooses to kiss her friend Eric Slater (Harland Williams) instead.

In a domestic violence case (in which I was the accused, but by God I was innocent) with my ex girlfriend, the lawyer whom I hired and paid his dues, openly played a wheeling and dealing game for two and a half years with the prosecutor and had mercilessly thrown me in front of the prosecutor. My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles’ child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family. Although I mentioned this to my “so called” lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled. After all these and after having me pushed into loosing my otherwise strong case, I was sentenced with restriction order to my own home, loosing all I had paid for it, loosing my stuff inside home, aforced probation and a forced domestic violence course for no good reason, my so called bloody lawyer also sent to the court a paper indicating that I owed to him and never had paid his dues.

Two different office ladies advised me that the \\"dr\\" would be the one who would determine that???? Really??? So after a third call trying to explain that I needed to be seen by the doctor as well as have an ultrasound, the lady told me that a nurse would call me back. NEVER HAPPENED. Went in to my appt and had to wait an extra week and 3 days until I could get in for an ultrasound. They had ONE ultrasound tech at the office. Two weeks later, my 6yo son came down with Fifth's Disease (a virus that can be deadly to fetuses). I called at 8 am in the morning asking to just come in for bloodwork to confirm my immunity and for peace of mind. Was advised the nurse would call me back?? At 1:30 pm, still no call back, so I called again. The lady told me someone would call me back by the end of the day. Why won't they put me through to someone so I can make an appointment?

The perception and experience of the reviewer are characterized by deep dissatisfaction, disappointment, and concern, mainly due to the unresponsiveness, lack of organization, and neglect they faced from their medical providers. The key issues highlighted that contribute to the negative sentiment include: - Inadequate Communication: The customer experienced a significant lack of communication, with multiple promises of call-backs from a nurse which never happened, resulting in frustration and dissatisfaction. - Delayed Services: The review indicates prolonged waiting times for crucial procedures such as ultrasound scans. There is a deep sense of disappointment attributed to the delay, especially considering the urgency tied to her pregnancy with twins. - Lack of Individualized Attention and Care: The customer felt their needs and particular circumstances (being pregnant with twins and the health concern related to Fifth's disease) were neglected and not given proper attention and care. They felt like the practice was too big and too busy to provide the personalized care they needed. - Organizational Inefficiency: The review also portrays the practice as not well-organized, suggesting systemic issues in how the practice operates, which mitigates efficient and satisfactory customer service. - Emotional Distress: Lastly, the reviewer expresses a significant amount of emotional distress, indicating that the practice's handling of the situation lacked empathy and concern, adding to the intensely negative sentiment. Overall, the review conveys an urgent need for improvement in patient communication, service delivery, and organizational efficiency in the mentioned medical practice. The sentiment invoked from this review could significantly impact the practice's reputation if such customer experiences persist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Atletico presented with La Liga trophy before match - 105 days after winning first title in 18 years at Nou Camp with 1-1 draw against Barcelona.","completion":"Title: Atletico Madrid Triumphs Over Eibar in First La Liga Home Game Atletico Madrid secured their first win of the season by defeating newly-promoted Eibar 2-1 in their first La Liga home game at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium. This victory comes on the heels of their opening match, which concluded in a goalless stalemate against Rayo Vallecano. Despite the absence of head coach Diego Simeone from the touchline as he served his eight-match ban, the Rojiblancos managed to power through and claim their initial three points. Simeone, who was forced to watch from the stand, has been a key motivator for the team's recent resurgence and success. Before the match commenced, Atletico Madrid was presented with the La Liga trophy, marking 105 days since their momentous victory that secured their first league title in 18 years. The clinching game was a gripping 1-1 draw against Barcelona at the iconic Nou Camp stadium. Coming into the game against Eibar, Atletico Madrid remained focused on making their mark on the new season, building upon the momentum of their impressive title-winning campaign. Facing a team that had just earned promotion to the top division, the Rojiblancos were determined to demonstrate their prowess and intent to remain at the summit of Spanish football. The match began with a fairly equal distribution of possession, as both teams sought to establish their dominance. As the first half progressed, however, Atletico's quality and experience in the top flight began to shine through. Their well-organized defense, an attribute that has been the cornerstone of their success under manager Diego Simeone, limited Eibar's chances and stifled their attacks. On the other end of the pitch, Atletico's attack began to gather steam, with their forwards capitalizing on the opportunities they created. As a result, they managed to break the deadlock by scoring the opening goal, giving them a crucial lead heading into the half-time break. The second half saw more of the same, with Atletico's disciplined defending and potent attack continuing to put pressure on Eibar. Eventually, they doubled their advantage with another well-taken goal, putting the newly promoted side on the ropes. Eibar, however, displayed resilience and determination, managing to pull one back in the dying moments of the match. Despite their late surge, Atletico Madrid held on for a narrow victory, showcasing their grit and desire to succeed in the new season. With this crucial win, Atletico Madrid sets their sights on a successful title defense and mounting another challenge in the UEFA Champions League. As the season unfolds, it will be exciting to witness the potential evolution of this squad under the guidance of their inspirational coach, Diego Simeone, once his ban is lifted. In conclusion, Atletico Madrid's 2-1 triumph over Eibar in their first La Liga home game, while Simeone watched from the stand, serves as an early indication of the team's ongoing commitment to success. Their hard-fought victory, coming hot on the heels of their title win, shows that the Rojiblancos are eager to remain dominant forces both in Spanish and European football for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Saints commanded the first quarter with RB Chris Ivory getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by kicker Garrett Hartley getting a 50-yard field goal, and then by Ivory making a 6-yard TD run. The lead was narrowed as kicker David Buehler got a 21-yard field goal, but the Saints replied as Hartley nailed a 45-yard field goal.

The Saints, down 27-23, were well on their way to defeat when John Kitna hit Austin with a long-gainer, but safety Malcolm Jenkins stripped Roy Williams and recovered at the New Orleans 11, enabling the Saints to pull out the win five plays later, with QB Drew Brees completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore, completing an 89-yard drive. Which kicker kicked the most field goals?","completion":"The kicker who kicked the most field goals in the described game was Garrett Hartley from the Saints. Garrett Hartley kicked three field goals from distances of 50 yards, 45 yards, and 28 yards respectively. On the other hand, David Buehler from the Cowboys, kicked two field goals from 21 yards and 53 yards respectively. Thus, by comparing these stats, it's apparent that Garrett Hartley made more successful field goal attempts during this particular match. Kicking field goals is a critical part of a football game, contributing directly to the team's score. In this game, Hartley's contribution helped the Saints to secure the win over the Cowboys. Drew Brees's 12-yard touchdown pass to Lance Moore was the finale of an 89-yard drive which was made possible by the preceding plays, including Hartley's successful field goals.

We have this equation to solve: -48*i - 773 = 283 What we want to do is find the value of \\"i\\" that makes this equation true. Let's follow these steps: 1. Let's get rid of the number \\"-773\\" on the left side of the equation, so we can just have \\"-48*i\\" by itself. To do this, we will add \\"+773\\" to both sides of the equation. So, -48*i - 773 + 773 = 283 + 773 Now, -773 and +773 cancel each other out, and we're left with: -48*i = 1056 2. Now, we want to find \\"i\\" by itself. To do that, we need to get rid of the number \\"-48\\" that is next to the \\"i\\". Since it's multiplication (remember, -48 times \\"i\\"), we will do the opposite, which is division. We will divide both sides by \\"-48\\": (-48*i) / -48 = 1056 / -48 Now, -48 divided by -48 becomes \\"1\\" and the left side of the equation is just \\"i\\" now: i = -22 There you go!

Step 2: Analyze the given statement The statement says: \\"A copy of someone else's original idea is not infringing unless it copies that person's unique, tangible expression of the idea.\\" Step 3: Evaluate the statement in the context of intellectual property laws According to copyright law, infringement occurs when one's work is copied or distributed without the permission of the copyright holder. The law protects the tangible expression of an idea but not the idea itself. This means that infringement occurs when someone duplicates the way an idea was expressed (such as through writing, music, or art), rather than the idea itself. Step 4: Determine if the statement is correct The given statement emphasizes that infringement does not occur due to the copying of the idea itself but the copying of the \\"unique, tangible expression of the idea.\\" This aligns with the principles of copyright law.

John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 - August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. Cage's work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting the mood of the era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. HPSCHD (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with fifty-two tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 slides of designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four slide projectors, with forty motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there. Also in 1969, Cage produced the first fully notated work in years: Cheap Imitation for piano. The piece is a chance-controlled reworking of Erik Satie's Socrate, and, as both listeners and Cage himself noted, openly sympathetic to its source. Although Cage's affection for Satie's music was well-known, it was highly unusual for him to compose a personal work, one in which the composer is present. When asked about this apparent contradiction, Cage replied: \\"Obviously, Cheap Imitation lies outside of what may seem necessary in my work in general, and that's disturbing. I'm the first to be disturbed by it.\\" Cage's fondness for the piece resulted in a recording--a rare occurrence, since Cage disliked making recordings of his music--made in 1976. Overall, Cheap Imitation marked a major change in Cage's music: he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments, and tried out several new approaches, such as improvisation, which he previously discouraged, but was able to use in works from the 1970s, such as Child of Tree (1975). Cheap Imitation became the last work Cage performed in public himself. Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960, and by the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform. Nevertheless, he still played Cheap Imitation during the 1970s, before finally having to give up performing. Preparing manuscripts also became difficult: before, published versions of pieces were done in Cage's calligraphic script; now, manuscripts for publication had to be completed by assistants. Matters were complicated further by David Tudor's departure from performing, which happened in early 1970s. Tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead, and so Cage, for the first time in two decades, had to start relying on commissions from other performers, and their respective abilities. Such performers included Grete Sultan, Paul Zukofsky, Margaret Leng Tan, and many others. Aside from music, Cage continued writing books of prose and poetry (mesostics). M was first published by Wesleyan University Press in 1973. In January 1978 Cage was invited by Kathan Brown of Crown Point Press to engage in printmaking, and Cage would go on to produce series of prints every year until his death; these, together with some late watercolors, constitute the largest portion of his extant visual art. In 1979 Cage's Empty Words was first published by Wesleyan University Press. In 1987, Cage completed a piece called Two, for flute and piano, dedicated to performers Roberto Fabbriciani and Carlo Neri. The title referred to the number of performers needed; the music consisted of short notated fragments to be played at any tempo within the indicated time constraints. Cage went on to write some forty such pieces, one of the last being Eighty (1992, premiered in Munich on 28 October 2011), usually employing a variant of the same technique; together, these works are known as Number Pieces. The process of composition, in many of the later Number Pieces, was simple selection of pitch range and pitches from that range, using chance procedures; the music has been linked to Cage's anarchic leanings. One11 (i.e. the eleventh piece for a single performer), completed in early 1992, was Cage's first and only foray into film. Another new direction, also taken in 1987, was opera: Cage produced five operas, all sharing the same title Europera, in 1987-91. Europeras I and II require greater forces than III, IV and V, which are on a chamber scale. Already in the course of the 1980s, Cage's health worsened progressively: he suffered not only from arthritis, but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis. He suffered a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted, and, in 1985, broke an arm. During this time, Cage pursued a macrobiotic diet. Nevertheless, ever since arthritis started plaguing him, the composer was aware of his age, and, as biographer David Revill observed, \\"the fire which he began to incorporate in his visual work in 1985 is not only the fire he has set aside for so long--the fire of passion--but also fire as transitoriness and fragility.\\" On August 11, 1992, while preparing evening tea for himself and Cunningham, Cage suffered another stroke. He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, where he died on the morning of August 12. He was 79. According to his wishes, Cage's body was cremated, and the ashes scattered in the Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, New York, the same place where Cage scattered the ashes of his parents, years before. The composer's death occurred only weeks before a celebration of his 80th birthday organized in Frankfurt by the composer Walter Zimmermann and the musicologist Stefan Schaedler was due to take place. The event went ahead as planned, including a performance of the Concert for Piano and Orchestra by David Tudor and Ensemble Modern. Merce Cunningham lived another 17 years, dying of natural causes in July 2009. Cage's first completed pieces are currently lost. According to the composer, the earliest works were very short pieces for piano, composed using complex mathematical procedures and lacking in \\"sensual appeal and expressive power.\\" Cage then started producing pieces by improvising and writing down the results, until Richard Buhlig stressed to him the importance of structure. Most works from the early 1930s, such as Sonata for Clarinet (1933) and Composition for 3 Voices (1934), are highly chromatic and betray Cage's interest in counterpoint. Around the same time, the composer also developed a type of a tone row technique with 25-note rows. After studies with Schoenberg, who never taught dodecaphony to his students, Cage developed another tone row technique, in which the row was split into short motives, which would then be repeated and transposed according to a set of rules. This approach was first used in Two Pieces for Piano (c. 1935), and then, with modifications, in larger works such as Metamorphosis and Five Songs (both 1938). Soon after Cage started writing percussion music and music for modern dance, he started using a technique that placed the rhythmic structure of the piece into the foreground. In Imaginary Landscape No. 1 (1939) there are four large sections of 16, 17, 18, and 19 bars, and each section is divided into four subsections, the first three of which were all 5 bars long. First Construction (in Metal) (1939) expands on the concept: there are five sections of 4, 3, 2, 3, and 4 units respectively. Each unit contains 16 bars, and is divided the same way: 4 bars, 3 bars, 2 bars, etc. Finally, the musical content of the piece is based on sixteen motives. Such \\"nested proportions\\", as Cage called them, became a regular feature of his music throughout the 1940s. The technique was elevated to great complexity in later pieces such as Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano (1946-48), in which many proportions used non-integer numbers (1 1/4 , 3/4 , 1 1/4 , 3/4 , 1 1/2 , and 1 1/2 for Sonata I, for example), or A Flower, a song for voice and closed piano, in which two sets of proportions are used simultaneously. In late 1940s, Cage started developing further methods of breaking away with traditional harmony. For instance, in String Quartet in Four Parts (1950) Cage first composed a number of gamuts: chords with fixed instrumentation. The piece progresses from one gamut to another. In each instance the gamut was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody, and so the rest of the notes do not form any directional harmony. Concerto for prepared piano (1950-51) used a system of charts of durations, dynamics, melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric patterns. The last movement of the concerto was a step towards using chance procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards.

She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself.

Background: Clemens was born in Dayton, Ohio, the fifth child of Bill and Bess (Lee) Clemens. He is of German descent, his great-grandfather Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Context: Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium on May 6, 2007, during the seventh-inning stretch of a game against the Seattle Mariners, and made a brief statement: \\"Thank y'all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you it's a privilege to be back. I'll be talkin' to y'all soon.\\" It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster, agreeing to a pro-rated one-year deal worth 28,000,022, or about 4.7 million per month. Over the contract life, he would make 18.7 million. This equated to just over 1 million per start that season. Clemens made his 2007 return on June 9, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates by pitching six innings with seven strikeouts and 3 runs allowed. On June 21, with a single in the 5th inning against the Colorado Rockies, Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days). On June 24, Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the San Francisco Giants. It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history. On July 2, Clemens collected his 350th win against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is one of only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins. The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens's manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008. His final regular season appearance was a start against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, in which he allowed 2 hits and 1 unearned run in 6 innings, and received a no-decision.

The incident took place amid the long-standing conflict in the war-torn country, highlighting the complex, difficult, and tragic situations military personnel often find themselves in. The names and ranks of the two Marine individuals involved in the case have not been released for security reasons. However, it has been confirmed that a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the civilian's death is being conducted. Even though few details have been provided on the matter, the hearing comes as a crucial step in promoting transparency and accountability within the ranks of the military. High-ranking officials have echoed sentiments that all military personnel should be held responsible for their actions, abiding by international laws and demonstrating a strong commitment to upholding the principles of justice and human rights. As the legal process unfolds, the case serves as a stark reminder to both the military and civilian sectors of the importance of cultivating a sense of responsibility and understanding the consequences of one's actions. The impact of military operations on local populations continues to be a matter of great concern worldwide, and it is a crucial necessity for all involved parties to assess and address the consequences resulting from any misconduct. The preliminary hearing for the two Marines is expected to shed more light on the details of the incident and determine the course of action to be taken for any possible violations. This case underlines the ongoing efforts of the United States military in maintaining a high level of scrutiny and accountability to protect both its service members and civilians living in conflict zones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A construction crew is waiting around with yellow and orange jackets.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Workers preparing to lay concrete\\"?","completion":"From the statement \\"A construction crew is waiting around with yellow and orange jackets,\\" we cannot logically conclude that the workers are preparing to lay concrete. While it is possible that the construction crew might be involved in a project that requires concrete work, simply knowing that they are wearing yellow and orange jackets does not provide enough information to determine their specific task or responsibility. Construction crews perform a wide variety of tasks, including demolition, excavation, carpentry, electrical work, plumbing, and masonry, among others. Furthermore, yellow and orange jackets are common safety clothing items worn by construction workers to increase their visibility, irrespective of their specific role. To logically conclude that the workers are preparing to lay concrete, we would need more information about the construction project or their specific job tasks. Examples of additional information that could support the conclusion that the workers are preparing to lay concrete might include: 1. Observing construction equipment and tools associated with concrete work, such as a concrete mixer, trowels, or screeds. 2. Seeing the delivery of raw materials specific to concrete work, such as bags of cement, sand, or gravel. 3. Noticing signs or markings at the construction site indicating an area designated for concrete pouring or curing. 4. Overhearing conversations between the workers discussing plans related to concrete work or verifying concrete measurements. 5. Observing the presence of concrete forms or rebar laid out in preparation for pouring concrete. In conclusion, while it might be possible that the workers are preparing to lay concrete, the fact that they are wearing yellow and orange jackets does not provide enough information to draw that conclusion logically.

If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was equally possible about the surface of the water in the bucket?","completion":"Imagine you have a toy bucket filled with water. Now, if you spin the bucket around, the water inside will eventually form a curved or dipped shape because of the spinning motion. This is what Newton explained. However, Mr. Mach had a thought experiment. He asked us to pretend that there is only one thing in the whole universe - this bucket filled with water. In this case, there is nothing else to compare the spinning motion with. So, it becomes really hard to say for sure if the bucket is spinning or not. The equally possible thing about the surface of the water in the bucket in Mach's experiment is that it could remain flat, just like when the bucket is not spinning. This is because we can't really tell if the bucket is spinning or not when there's nothing else in the universe to compare it with. It's like when you close your eyes and spin around, you might feel dizzy, but you can't be sure which way you faced when you stopped spinning because there's nothing to measure it against. So, in summary, what's equally possible about the surface of the water in the bucket in Mach's thought experiment is that it could have the curved shape (like when it's spinning) or stay flat (like when it's not spinning), because there's nothing to compare its motion with in the imagined universe with only the bucket."},{"prompt":"Question: Where does the young couple promise to meet again in six months?

Mr Obama announced, 'I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,' during another ABC interview last Wednesday. The historic declaration is intended to fire up liberal activists who consider gay marriage to be a hugely symbolic social issue. Mr","completion":"Obama wanted to show that he really cares about allowing people who are the same gender to get married, and he wanted everyone to know this when he was trying to get people to vote for him. He went on a TV show called The View to talk to people about it and said that his thoughts about gay marriage are very different from the other person he was competing against, Mr. Romney. Just a bit earlier, Mr. Obama had said, \\"I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,\\" on another TV show. He wanted people who think it's important for everyone to be allowed to marry the person they love, no matter if they're a man or woman, to support him and help him win."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. What did Meg do after her anger simmered? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available choices: * no; * yes;","completion":"Let's address the first question: Why do many software engineers not like Java? Java is a popular, versatile, and widely used programming language, but it has its share of detractors. There are several reasons why some software engineers may not like Java: 1. Verbosity: Java is known for its lengthy syntax, which can lead to large amounts of repetitive and boilerplate code. In comparison, some other languages have more streamlined syntax, which can make the code easier to read, write, and debug. 2. Performance: While Java has made significant improvements in recent years, the performance of Java applications can still be slower than those written in other languages like C++ or Go. This can be due to the fact that Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which may introduce some overhead in system resources. 3. Memory consumption: Java's garbage collection system, which automatically reclaims memory by periodically scanning for objects no longer in use, can lead to increased memory consumption and unpredictable performance. In contrast, languages like C++ require developers to manage their own memory allocation and deallocation. 4. Forced object orientation: Java enforces an object-oriented programming (OOP) model, which might not be suitable for all types of problems. Some developers prefer functional programming languages, like Haskell or Scala, which offer alternative programming paradigms unsupported by Java. 5. Lack of modern features: While Java has been improving and adding new features, some developers find it still lags behind other cutting-edge languages like Python, JavaScript, or Rust in terms of convenience features and language innovations. Now, let's discuss the second question: Why do many software engineers retire early? 1. High-paying jobs: Software engineers often command high salaries, which can enable them to save and invest money more rapidly than individuals working in other fields. As a result, they may be able to retire early due to financial security. 2. Mental fatigue: The software engineering field is marked by rapid change and innovation. Staying up-to-date with new tools, technologies, and techniques can be mentally draining. For some software engineers, tech burnout leads them to retire early. 3. Stressful working conditions: The demand for software products and the pressure to meet deadlines can place significant stress on engineers. Busy work schedules, challenging projects, and the expectation to perform at a high level can eventually take a toll on an engineer's mental and physical health, prompting them to seek early retirement. 4. Desire for a change in lifestyle or career: Some software engineers may choose to retire early to pursue other interests or embark on new career paths. They might be interested in starting their own business, dedicating more time to hobbies, or finding a less demanding career with a better work-life balance. 5. Impacts of aging: As software engineers age, they may experience ageism in the workplace or find it increasingly difficult to stay competitive in a dynamic and fast-paced field. Early retirement could be an option to avoid potential age-based discrimination or to step aside for younger, more agile developers. These two questions address different topics and are, therefore, not the same. Available choice: * no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Meade; [b]. his wife; [c]. not enough information; [d]. the brother; Q: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” According to the above context, answer the following question.

Our job is to find out what number \\"n\\" is. Let's do it step by step: 1. First, we need to move the 26 from the left side to the right side of the equation. Since it's a positive 26 on the left, we'll subtract 26 from both sides. This gives us: 27 * n = -1 - 26 2. Now we need to subtract -1 and -26 on the right side. When we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one, we get a negative number. So, -1 - 26 = -27. Our equation now looks like this: 27 * n = -27 3. The next step is to figure out what number we need to multiply 27 by to get -27. So we will divide both sides of the equation by 27: n = -27 / 27 4. And finally, when we divide -27 by 27, we get -1: n = -1 So, the number we were looking for is n = -1! Great job solving that math problem together!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. selling out B. hitting the jackpot C. receiving money D. happy E. getting paid The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is C. Receiving Money. After an accident, when someone is said to be \\"cashing in,\\" it generally means that they are benefiting financially as a result of the situation. In this case, the judge has ruled in favor of the individual, thereby granting them reimbursement or compensation for damages, losses, or injuries sustained in the accident. This compensation typically comes in the form of monetary payout. Option A, selling out, refers to abandoning one's principles or integrity for personal gain or profit, which is not directly applicable to the scenario. Option B, hitting the jackpot, refers to winning a large sum of money unexpectedly, usually in a lottery or gambling situation. While receiving compensation can be a considerable sum of money, it is typically not regarded as \\"hitting the jackpot\\" since it is not a chance-based outcome. Option D, happy, is an emotional response to a situation. It is likely that the individual will be pleased with the judge's ruling, but it does not explicitly describe the outcome they are experiencing. Being happy can be a consequence of the ruling, but it doesn't address the individual's financial situation directly. Option E, getting paid, is similar to receiving money; however, it usually implies a regular wage or payment for work completed or services rendered. In the context of compensation after an accident, \\"receiving money\\" is more appropriate. Therefore, the best answer to the question is C. Receiving Money, as it accurately represents the result of the judge's ruling in the specified scenario, where the individual would be financially compensated for the damages or losses experienced due to the accident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.","completion":"In the given article, the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects, and ideas is Giacomo Puccini."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early with Cowboys QB Tony Romo completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Dallas' lead increased with OLB returning an interception 41 yards for a touchdown on the very first play of the period. Fortunately, the Falcons fought back with QB Michael Vick throwing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith and a 9-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins. It was after the second touchdown that an NFL record was set. After kicker Morten Andersen's extra point, he became the league's all-time leading scorer with 2,435 points. His total after the game would be 2,437 points. After Atlanta's second score of the game, the Cowboys jumped back into action, with Romo completing a 51-yard TD pass to Owens. Fortunately, the Falcons managed to tie the game going into halftime with Vick's 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie. In the third quarter, Atlanta took the lead with Vick's 5-yard TD pass to Griffith. However, the joy was short-lived as Dallas took over for the rest of the game with kicker Martin Gramatica's 48-yard field goal and RB Marion Barber's 9-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys wrapped up the game with Barber's 3-yard TD run. With the loss, the Falcons fell to 7-7. Fortunately, not all was bad.

Carson gave Aubrey food to eat at his home. Given the context: How would Aubrey feel as a result? Possible answers: wouldn't do anything in return, wouldn't appreciate the food and would complain, grateful for the food","completion":"In the context provided, it is most likely that Aubrey would feel grateful for the food provided by Carson at his home. Hospitality is an important aspect of our social interactions, and sharing a meal with someone can create a sense of warmth, connection, and belonging. When someone goes out of their way to invite and feed a guest, it can often be seen as a gesture of generosity, care, and an extension of friendship. As such, Aubrey is likely to appreciate this kind approach by Carson, as it shows that he values her presence and wants her to feel welcome and at home. Although it is possible that someone might not appreciate such a kind gesture, it is essential to consider the context in which the food is offered. Given that no additional information suggests any underlying conflicts or contrasts in preferences, we can safely assume that Aubrey would not experience negative feelings, such as not appreciating the food or wanting to complain. Moreover, Aubrey would not necessarily have to do anything in return immediately as a direct result of the meal. While reciprocal actions are important in maintaining and strengthening relationships, such gestures should come naturally and not be forced. It's possible that Aubrey might express her gratitude in other ways, such as helping with the dishes, praising the quality of the meal, or arranging a future gathering in return. The overall experience of sharing a meal in Carson's home, if handled with care and consideration, could also create a sense of closer bonding between the two individuals involved. Through positive body language and engaging in meaningful conversations during the meal, both Carson and Aubrey can enhance their interpersonal relationship and establish a foundation of trust and attachment. In conclusion, based on the provided context, it seems most probable that Aubrey would feel grateful for the food provided by Carson at his home. This gesture of hospitality is a symbol of kindness, generosity, and an extension of friendship, which Aubrey would likely appreciate as a reflection of Carson's care for her well-being and comfort."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a conversation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What animals' flocks make a quiet chattering sound while at rest?, using the article: The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through.

Nationalist parties, however, together with other liberal groups, said that they would boycott the elections in July. 2. Other liberal parties, however, along with nationalist groups, said that they would boycott the July elections. Both sentences are discussing nationalist parties and other liberal groups who plan to boycott elections. In both cases, the parties plan to boycott elections held in July. The primary differences between the sentences are the ordering of the subjects and the phrasing used to express the boycott. In the first sentence, the focus is initially on nationalist parties, and then it mentions other liberal groups in conjunction with them. The term \\"together with\\" is used to show the connection between these two different party types. The sentence states that these combined political groups intend to boycott the elections, which are specified as happening in July.

The city is located on the island of New Providence, which functions much like a business district. Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates. The city was named in honour of William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau. - The Olympic Games (\\"Olympia\\", \\"the Olympics\\" also \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in 393 AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or \\"olympiad\\", which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. - Dominic Demeritte ( born February 22 , 1978 in Nassau , Bahamas ) is a track and field sprinter who specializes in the 200 metres . - The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago. It consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. The state capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \\"The Bahamas\\" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses of ocean space. - Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass. Sometimes the runners are referred to as \\"harriers\\" (dogs). The course, typically long, may include surfaces of grass, and earth, pass through woodlands and open country, and include hills, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an individual and a team sport; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during autumn and winter, and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - New Providence is the most populous island in the Bahamas, containing more than 70% of the total population. It houses the national capital city of Nassau. The island was originally under Spanish control following Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World, but the Spanish government showed little interest in developing the island (and the Bahamas as a whole). Nassau, the island's largest city, was formerly known as Charles-town, but it was burned to the ground by the Spanish in 1684. It was laid out and renamed Nassau in 1695 by Nicholas Trott, the most successful Lord Proprietor, in honor of the Prince of Orange-Nassau who became William III of England. The three branches of Bahamian Government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, are all headquartered on New Providence. New Providence functions as the main commercial hub of the Bahamas. It is also home to more than 400 banks and trust companies, and its hotels and port account for more than two thirds of the four million-plus tourists who visit the Bahamas annually. Other settlements on New Providence include Grants Town, Bain Town, Fox Hill, Adelaide, Yamacraw, South Beach, Coral Harbour, Lyford Cay, Paradise Island, Sea Breeze, Centreville, The Grove (South) and The Grove (West Bay), Cable Beach, Delaporte, Gambier, and Love Beach. - Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing. The name is derived from the sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking. - The 200 metres (also spelled 200 meters) is a sprint running event. On an outdoor 400 m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight, so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the \\"stadion\\" and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games. The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes rely on different energy systems during the longer sprint. - Lynden Pindling International Airport , formerly known as Nassau International Airport, is the largest airport in the Bahamas and the largest international gateway into the country.

Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. Despite their short career, Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence. John Bush of AllMusic argues that Joy Division \\"became the first band in the post-punk movement by [...] emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s.\\" Joy Division have influenced bands as diverse as contemporaries U2 and the Cure to artists such as Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Neurosis, Interpol, Bloc Party, the Editors and rap artists. Rapper Danny Brown is known to have named one of his albums after the Joy Division song \\"Atrocity Exhibition\\", whose title was partially inspired by the 1970 J. G. Ballard collection of condensed novels of the same name. In 2005, both New Order and Joy Division were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. The band's dark sound, which Martin Hannett described in 1979 as \\"dancing music with Gothic overtones\\", presaged the gothic rock genre. While the term \\"gothic\\" originally described a \\"doomy atmosphere\\" in music of the late 1970s, the term was soon applied to specific bands like Bauhaus that followed in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included \\"high-pitched post-Joy Division basslines usurp[ing] the melodic role\\" and \\"vocals that were either near operatic and Teutonic or deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Ian Curtis.\\" Joy Division have been dramatised in two biopics. 24 Hour Party People (2002) is a fictionalised account of the rise and fall of Factory Records in which members of the band served as supporting characters. Tony Wilson said of the film, \\"It's all true, it's all not true. It's not a fucking documentary\\", and that he favoured the \\"myth\\" over the truth. The 2007 film Control, directed by Anton Corbijn, is a biography of Ian Curtis (portrayed by Sam Riley) that uses Deborah Curtis's biography of her late husband, Touching from a Distance (1995), as its basis. Control had its international premiere on the opening night of Director's Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, where it was critically well received.

Problem: the diameters of two spheres are in the ratio 1 : 2 what is the ratio of their volumes ? Options: a ) 1 : 9 , b ) 1 : 2 , c ) 1 : 8 , d ) 1 : 1 , e ) 1 : 6","completion":"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps: 1. Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius. 2. Find the relationship between the radii of the two spheres based on their diameter ratio. 3. Use the volume formula and the relationship between the radii to find the ratio of the volumes. So, let's begin: Step 1: Remember the volume formula V = (4/3)πr^3 Step 2: Find the radii relationship The ratio of their diameters is 1 : 2. Since the radius is half the diameter, the ratio of their radii will also be 1 : 2. Step 3: Use the volume formula and the radii relationship. Let's denote the radii of the spheres as r1 and r2. According to the given ratio, r2 = 2 * r1. Now, let's find the ratio of their volumes: V1 = (4/3)π(r1)^3 V2 = (4/3)π(r2)^3 => (4/3)π(2 * r1)^3 To find the ratio of their volumes, we will divide V2 by V1: (V2 / V1) = ((4/3)π(2 * r1)^3) / ((4/3)π(r1)^3) The terms (4/3)π appear in both the numerator and denominator, and we can cancel them out. So we're left with: (V2 / V1) = (2 * r1)^3 / (r1)^3 Now let's cube (2 * r1): (2 * r1)^3 = 2^3 * r1^3 = 8 * r1^3 Therefore, the ratio of their volumes is: (V2 / V1) = 8 * r1^3 / r1^3 = 8 So, the correct option for the given problem is: c) 1 : 8"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He wants to know how earth's atmosphere differed in two different time. To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities. and a hint : When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. Please answer this question : In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Time B. In Time A (the year 1000), the use of fossil fuels was not very common, so the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to human activities was relatively low. In this period, the carbon cycle would be less impacted by human interference. In Time B (the year 2000), the use of fossil fuels has significantly increased. The burning of these fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. Consequently, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it, contributing to an increased amount of greenhouse gases. This leads to global warming, also known as global climate change, which results in a rise in Earth's temperature. Therefore, Time B is the period in which more carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere due to the increased use of fossil fuels and human activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In which Indian city did British troops open fire without warning on a crowd of 10,000 in 1919????","completion":"The city in which British troops opened fire without warning on a crowd of approximately 10,000 in 1919 is Amritsar, located in the Punjab province of British India (present-day Punjab, India). The event referred to is known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, which took place on April 13, 1919. The incident occurred during the Indian struggle for independence from British rule. During that time, India was undergoing a period of increasing political unrest, further amplified by the oppressive measures imposed by the colonial government, such as the Rowlatt Act. This particular act allowed the British authorities to arrest and detain Indians without trial if they were suspected of sedition or plotting against the British government. On April 13, 1919, thousands of Indians from Amritsar and the surrounding areas had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh, a public garden in the city, to protest the Rowlatt Act peacefully. The gathering also coincided with the Punjabi festival of Baisakhi, a major cultural and religious event for the Sikh community. Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, a British officer, led a contingent of fifty soldiers armed with rifles to the site. Upon arriving, Dyer ordered his men to open fire on the unarmed crowd without providing any warning. The troops continued firing for approximately ten minutes, eventually stopping only when they had exhausted their ammunition. The shooting resulted in the deaths of at least 379 people, with over 1,000 others injured. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre drew widespread condemnation both in India and abroad. The brutal nature of the event fueled resentment against British rule and significantly contributed to the Indian independence movement. In the years that followed, the massacre became a symbol of the colonial atrocities committed by the British government in India. The site of the tragedy, Jallianwala Bagh, is now a national memorial commemorating the victims of the massacre. It serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by the Indian people in their fight for freedom and independence from colonial rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:They did a field experiment in Germany with 3,000 adults at Munich's famous annual Oktoberfest. The odds of heart arrhythmia increased as beer consumption went up. Most of the arrhythmias were \\"apparently harmless\\" sinus tachycardia, where the heart just beats faster than normal, but a few were not. Around 5% of the arrhythmias recorded were potentially more worrying, and included one type called atrial fibrillation, which, if it persists, is linked to an increased risk of stroke and heart failure. These odds are very low, which meant there was no significant link between alcohol and dangerous heart arrhythmias in the study. But there was a significant link between alcohol consumption and more benign arrhythmias. The volunteers, who were all deemed sober enough to take part in the tests, had heart traces taken using a mobile phone app while they partied. Although it is not surprising that heart rate might increase in a party atmosphere, sinus tachycardia was far more common among the drinkers who had downed a few Steins of beer at the Oktoberfest than in the 400 or so abstainers. The likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia increased as the number of grams of alcohol per kilogram of blood (measured with a breathalyser) went up. Even though the \\"lively atmosphere in the beer tent\\" was not the ideal setting for doing the heart traces, the researchers were able to get reliable recordings for almost all of the volunteers, the European Heart Journal reports. They found arrhythmias in 30% of these 30-second recordings - more than would be expected in a general population. The researchers think it is possible that innocent arrhythmias could sometimes lead to more serious ones, such as atrial fibrillation, within days of drinking lots of alcohol, although they did not test this out in their study. They now plan more research to check if this \\"Holiday Heart Syndrome\\" - arrhythmia triggered by an a sudden alcohol binge - exists and, if it does, whether it remedies itself. Researcher Dr Moritz Sinner from the University Hospital of Munich said: \\"What we have found is that alcohol does interfere with heart rhythm, which hasn't been shown like this before. \\"What we still don't know is what happens after people stop drinking or continue to drink. What happens the next day or the day after?\\" Dr Mike Knapton from the British Heart Foundation said: \\"Using the Munich Oktoberfest as a real world laboratory is a unique approach and has given us an insight into how heavy drinking over a short space of time can increase people's chances of having an abnormal heart rhythm. However, longer-term follow-up is needed to confirm if this type of drinking has a lasting effect in giving people potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. \\"Extensive research has shown that alcohol consumption is associated with a range of diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Our advice is to drink in moderation, or no more than 14 units of alcohol per week.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"This article talks about a study done in Germany during Munich's annual Oktoberfest.

What happens next? How to find a home Establish your budget so that you can focus only on the homes within your price range. With so many homes on the market you really need to narrow the selection down, and a budget is one of the factors that will determine your choice. Make sure that your budget allows you to live in your home, not just own it.","completion":"After establishing your budget, there are several important steps to follow in order to find a home that fits your needs and preferences. Here's a detailed guide to help you navigate through this process: 1. Determine your needs and preferences: Think about the characteristics of a home that are most important to you, such as the size, style, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, proximity to schools, and community amenities. Make a list of your top priorities, as well as a separate list of features that you would consider a bonus. 2. Choose a location: Research different neighborhoods and communities that fit your lifestyle, budget, and long-term goals. Consider factors like school districts, commute times, walkability, safety, and access to amenities such as shops, restaurants, public transportation, parks, and recreational facilities. 3. Contact a real estate agent: Partner with a licensed real estate agent to help you search for homes, schedule showings, negotiate offers, and navigate the complexities of the home buying process. A good agent will be knowledgeable about the local market, provide valuable advice, and advocate on your behalf throughout the process. 4. Get pre-approved for a mortgage: Meet with a mortgage lender to determine how much you can borrow based on your credit, income, and assets. A pre-approval letter not only demonstrates to sellers that you’re a serious buyer, but it also helps you shop for homes within your price range. 5. Begin your search: Using your must-have and wish-list features, as well as your budget and desired location, begin searching for homes online and attending open houses. Your real estate agent can set up personalized property alerts based on your criteria and arrange private showings. 6. Evaluate potential properties: When you find a home that interests you, evaluate its condition, layout, and potential resale value. Consider factors such as maintenance, neighborhood growth, and future developments. Don't hesitate to ask your real estate agent for advice and guidance. 7. Make an offer and negotiate: Once you’ve found a home that meets your criteria, work with your agent to make a competitive offer based on comparable homes in the area, market conditions, and the property’s condition. Be prepared to negotiate with the seller and be flexible on certain terms, such as closing date or contingencies. 8. Schedule a home inspection: If your offer is accepted, schedule a professional home inspection to identify any potential issues or problems with the property. Based on the inspection results, you may need to renegotiate the purchase price or request repairs before closing. 9. Complete the mortgage process: With an accepted offer and a satisfactory home inspection, work closely with your mortgage lender to complete the loan application and submit all required documents. The lender will schedule an appraisal to ensure the property’s value matches the agreed-upon purchase price. 10. Close the deal: After the mortgage is approved and all contingencies have been met, work with your real estate agent and attorney (if applicable) to review and sign all closing documents. You’ll pay your down payment, closing costs, and receive the keys to your new home. Congratulations, you have successfully found and purchased your new home! After moving in, it's essential to maintain your property in order to protect your investment and enjoy your new abode to the fullest. Make sure to plan for regular maintenance, address repairs promptly, and stay informed about changes in your local housing market and community developments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Amanda Sedgmer, mother of five and daughter of coal country, believes that in this presidential election, her way of life is at stake. \\"If you ask anybody in the coal industry what would happen if Obama is re-elected, they'd say the coal industry is done,\\" said Sedgmer, whose husband, Ryan, is a coal miner and whose family has depended on the industry for at least four generations. Sedgmer lives in Hopedale, Ohio, which sits on top of one of the state's richest coal deposits. For nearly a century here, mining has been one of the few professions guaranteeing a good and consistent salary. Read Sedgmer's original story on CNN iReport. But in the past two years, an increasing number of coal-powered electricity plants across the country have announced closures. Estimates vary, but banking and industry analysis firm Credit Suisse put expected and known closures for 2009-2012 at 111 plants, that's one-fifth of the nation's nearly 500 coal plants. There are two main factors in the demise of those plants. First, the price of coal's competitor, natural gas, is decreasing. At the same time, a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency is pushing the price of coal up. That change, called the Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, rule requires that coal- and oil-fired power plants reduce pollutant emission rates significantly. The rule, which operates under the Clean Air Act, does not stipulate a lower level of carbon output. But by requiring lower mercury and other toxic emissions, it would reduce carbon as well. Coal mining families aren't the only ones facing shifts in industry. The EPA estimates this will result in some 1% of national electricity capacity shutting down, and a cost increase of about 3.7% in retail electricity. But those in coal country give much higher estimates. They believe if President Obama stays in office and the rule continues, it will mean the end of their industry. \\"If coal fell, which is one of the main sources of employment around this area, everything would suffer,\\" Sedgmer said while sitting on her front porch. \\"There'd be no funding for the schools, which are already suffering. I can't see how destroying one industry benefits anything.\\" The job is a source of income for the family and pride for Ryan. \\"I like it,\\" the 30-year-old said. \\"I enjoy doing it. ... It's provided for our family. We have a big family and we haven't had to worry about too much.\\" Watch behind-the-scenes interview with Sedgmer. The Sedgmers have invested a lot in their home in Hopedale, which is next to the towns where Ryan and Amanda grew up. When another mining job moved the family away, the Sedgmers rented out the 100-year-old home, keeping a foothold in their community. Thanks to a new mining job, two weeks ago the Sedgmers moved back to the area. They put up a \\"Home Sweet Home\\" sign in the kitchen. They want to stay. \\"If all coal mines shut down,\\" Amanda Sedgmer paused, \\"we would struggle ... we would definitely lose our house. \\" Sedgmer voted for President Obama in 2008 and she is not a particular fan of Mitt Romney, but she's voting for the Republican because she believes he is the only chance the coal industry and her community have to survive. Romney hopes all this concern helps him in the Buckeye swing state and in other coal communities. He has told crowds at campaign speeches that President Obama \\"sure doesn't like coal.\\" The president has vigorously disagreed, saying he is for \\"clean coal.\\" Environmentalists believe the EPA rule and the increasing closures of coal plants are breakthroughs that are overdue and will do dramatic good. Les Brown, the president of the Earth Policy Institute, points to studies that coal emissions, including mercury and other pollutants, cause more than 10,000 deaths a year. \\"It's a war for survival,\\" Brown said, sitting in a Washington office filled with piles of reports and papers about the environment. \\"Saving lives, not just a handful of lives, but thousands of lives. But more broadly, saving the planet.\\" Would he like to see all coal plants closed? \\"Yes,\\" Brown responded, \\"It would be cleaner, it would be safer and it would help stabilize the climate, which is the big threat to our future. I mean it's even difficult to put a price tag on that.\\" Brown sees the problems with coal and climate change as a very human issue that could lead to droughts in some places, including the American Midwest, and floods in other places, like the American coasts. In either case, Brown fears loss of crops, homes and lives. But the same issue is personal to Amanda Sedgmer. Every day as Ryan prepares to go underground, he checks a bulletin board listing the latest coal closures. The Sedgmers' five children are still young, aged 16 months to 10 years. Those old enough to speak already talk about coal. When asked what he wants to do when he grows up, 4-year-old Ben Sedgmer blurts out, \\"Coal miner!\\" But his parents don't know if there will be many, or any, coal mining jobs waiting for him in Hopedale when he's old enough. For both sides, the war over coal is personal. And it is happening this election year. See all of the Embed America coverage here. And track the Embed team's progress on our map.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"Two girls laugh while other girls look on.\\", is the sentence \\"Some children are laughing.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, based on the sentence \\"Two girls laugh while other girls look on.\\", the sentence \\"Some children are laughing.\\" can be considered true. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of why this is the case. The initial sentence has two main elements: 1. \\"Two girls laugh\\"—This indicates that there are at least two girls, and they are engaged in the act of laughing. 2. \\"other girls look on\\"—This suggests that, in addition to the first two girls who are laughing, there are more girls involved in the scene, but they are observing rather than participating in the laughter. Now, let's examine the second sentence: \\"Some children are laughing.\\" The term \\"children\\" can encompass both boys and girls. We know from the first sentence that there are at least two girls who are laughing, so it is accurate to say that \\"some children\\" (in this case, at least two girls) are indeed engaged in laughter. It is also important to note that the word \\"some\\" is a general term that represents an unspecified number, and can include an amount as small as two. Consequently, with the information we possess from the initial sentence, it is clear that the assertion \\"Some children are laughing\\" is indeed accurate. Though the gender may not be explicitly mentioned within the second sentence, it is fair to assume the concept of \\"girls\\" is included under the broader category of \\"children.\\" Therefore, the statement \\"Some children are laughing\\" is true and accurately reflects the scenario described in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use an ice pack. Stay with someone for 48 hours.\\"","completion":"Title: Promoting Brain Health and Recovery: An In-Depth Look at Concussion Care Introduction A concussion is a potential consequence of head trauma and requires appropriate care and intervention to mitigate complications and ensure a smooth recovery. Commonly caused by sports injuries, falls, and accidents, concussions can affect individuals across all age groups. It is essential to recognize the signs of a concussion and act accordingly to minimize the risk of long-term damage. This article takes an in-depth look at practical strategies - including rest, sleep, avoidance of mind-altering substances, pain relief, ice packs, and staying with someone - to aid in the critical 48 hours following a concussion. 1. Rest: The Power of Taking a Break The importance of physical rest following a concussion cannot be overstated. Giving the body time to recuperate after a head injury is crucial for reducing inflammation and allowing the brain to heal. During the first 48 hours after a concussion, it is recommended that the injured individual limits their physical activity, including strenuous exercises or heavy lifting. Engaging in gentle movements for essential tasks is permissible, but overall, a reduction in physical exertion allows for optimal recovery. 2. Get Plenty of Sleep: The Body's Natural Healer Sleep is when the body undergoes repair and restoration, which is vital after a concussion. Adequate rest assists in the brain's healing process, while sleep deprivation may slow recovery and negatively impact cognitive skills and mood. It is essential that the individual adjusts their sleep schedule to ensure sufficient rest. This may include extending their sleeping hours, modifying the sleep environment for comfort, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine. 3. Avoid Mind-Altering Substances: Protecting the Injured Brain The consumption of mind-altering substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs, and certain medications should be avoided by individuals who have sustained a concussion. These substances can inhibit the brain's ability to heal, impair cognitive function, and interfere with the region responsible for balance and coordination. Moreover, they can also increase the risk of experiencing another head injury and cause further harm. Consulting a healthcare professional before resuming the intake of any medications is essential to ensure their safety and appropriateness during the recovery period. 4. Take Pain Relievers: Alleviating Discomfort Headaches, a common symptom of concussions, can be relieved by over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, provided they are taken as directed. While these medications alleviate discomfort, they do not aid in the healing process. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper dosage and to avoid potential drug interactions. Any severe or persistent pain should be discussed with a healthcare provider. 5. Use an Ice Pack: Reducing Inflammation and Soothing Pain Icing the affected area is a simple yet effective way to provide relief from concussion-related headaches and reduce inflammation. Ice packs can be applied intermittently, with approximately 20 minutes on followed by 20 minutes off, during the 48 hours after the injury. Individuals should ensure that a barrier, like a towel, is placed between the skin and the ice pack to prevent cold burns. 6. Stay with Someone for 48 Hours: Ensuring Safety and Support After a concussion, it is crucial for the injured person to be monitored for worsening symptoms or adverse effects. Having someone stay with the individual for at least 48 hours post-injury helps ensure a quick response to any emergency, offers assistance with required tasks, and provides emotional support during the recovery process. Clear communication and education on concussion symptoms are essential, allowing them to recognize when professional medical help is necessary. Conclusion Post-concussion care is vital to optimize recovery, reduce complications, and promote long-term brain health. Adhering to the strategies discussed in this article—including the importance of rest, sleep, and avoidance of mind-altering substances, along with utilizing pain relief, ice packs, and having someone present for support—can help individuals navigate the challenging 48-hour period following a concussion. Proper care and adherence to medical advice can significantly impact a person's recovery and overall brain health in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Given the following context: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. answer the following question: Who was the majority group in Sao Paulo province?

B-Rad dresses and speaks like a gangster and essentially talks and acts like he is black. His father, Bill Gluckman, is running for governor of California. After Bill's campaign manager Tom Gibbons gets irritated with B-Rad's constant interruptions with the election, Bill decides that B-Rad must see a psychiatrist, Dr. Feldman.

Dr. Feldman tells B-Rad's parents Bill and Bess that B-Rad has the most serious case of \\"gangstaphrienia\\" that he has ever seen. Tom then has an idea to hire two actors, PJ and Sean James to try to scare B-Rad back to normal. Although Bill thinks it could get dangerous, he reluctantly agrees. With the help of PJ's cousin Shondra, they kidnap B-Rad and take him to the ghetto. Shondra tries to convince B-Rad that if he stops acting like a gangster, they will let him go. B-Rad tries to tell Shondra he cannot, it is who he is. The actors then try plan B, forcing B-Rad to rob a convenience store owned by a Korean American family.

Sadly in my job (Ob/gyn nurse) there is one thing I have to report fairly often, that a pregnancy is not going to happen. Sometimes the mom’s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining. Nothing is worse than the look on a woman’s face when she is looking forward to her first glimpse of her baby only to be told that the baby is not alive. It doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it. My own daughter called me one day to announce she was pregnant and two days later, we found out she was miscarrying and I bawled all day. I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water. I have to do a lot of this over the phone and that makes it even harder because I am not able to offer comfort and I don’t know where they are or what they are doing when they get this news. If they call me for their lab results, they might be driving, they might be walking around the mall, they will have to call their significant other and break the news, such difficult conversations to have over the phone.

Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography Min Fynske Barndom (My Childhood on Funen). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837–1881), was a talented musician.Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \\"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin\\". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense.Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 øre and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who recalls his mother singing folk songs during his childhood?, what is it ?

Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Answer the following question: where did the congregation of holy cross begin?","completion":"The Congregation of Holy Cross, a Catholic religious order founded by Blessed Basile Moreau, traces its origins to the city of Le Mans in northwestern France. Le Mans is located in the historical province of Maine and is now the capital of the Sarthe department. Basile Moreau, a diocesan priest and professor, was born in 1799 in the French village of Laigné-en-Belin, which is close to Le Mans. Throughout his life, Father Moreau focused on promoting Catholic education, ministering to the poor, and carrying out missions both nationally and internationally. The Congregation of Holy Cross began in 1837 when Father Moreau brought together two separate groups: the Brothers of Saint Joseph, founded by Father Jacques Dujarié in 1820, and a group of teaching priests called Auxiliary Priests. Both groups had been devoted to providing Catholic education and care to underprivileged communities. Father Moreau sought to combine their efforts and establish a united community that could have a greater impact on society. On March 1, 1837, the Congregation of Holy Cross was officially founded with the establishment of its first house in Sainte Croix, a neighborhood in Le Mans. The name \\"Holy Cross\\" was chosen primarily due to the new congregation’s location and to symbolize the religious order's commitment to bear witness to the cross of Christ through their work and ministry. The congregation initially focused on operating schools within France but soon expanded its missions to other parts of the world. In 1841, Father Moreau sent the first group of missionaries to Algeria, and later to the United States (1842) and Eastern Bengal, now modern-day Bangladesh (1851). In the United States, the Congregation of Holy Cross founded the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and St. Edward's University in Texas, among other institutions. They also extended their influence to Latin America, Africa, and Asia, providing education, healthcare, and social services to many communities. The Congregation of Holy Cross consists of two distinct societies, the priests and the brothers, who work together in their common mission. As per the vision of Father Moreau, the priests primarily focus on teaching, preaching, administering the sacraments, and conducting missions. The brothers focus on teaching and administering Catholic schools, providing healthcare services, and engaging in various social service ministries. Today, the Congregation of Holy Cross continues to maintain a significant global presence, educating young people and serving communities in need. Although it started in Le Mans, France, the congregation's work and mission have had a lasting impact on the lives of many people around the world."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Question: The seats were designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing, where were they seats located? Options: A. bowling alley B. space shuttle C. auditorium D. rest area E. beach The answer to this question is:","completion":"B. Space Shuttle The seats in a space shuttle were designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing, such as astronaut suits and associated gear. This makes sense, considering astronauts need to wear their spacesuits when inside the shuttle, especially during launch and re-entry. A space shuttle is a complex, technologically advanced vehicle designed to transport astronauts and payloads into outer space. The shuttle is built for both crew and cargo, with different compartments to accommodate the needs of the astronauts and the equipment they carry. The seats, located within the shuttle's crew compartment, are specifically designed to hold the astronauts safely and securely during the extreme conditions experienced during launches and re-entries. Given the many layers of protective clothing and life-support systems that astronauts must wear, accommodating those cumbersome garments is essential. Comparatively, the other options on the list do not have a clear or strong connection with cumbersome clothing. In general, clothing worn when visiting a bowling alley (option A) or beach (option E) is expected to be comfortable and casual. While people may dress more formally for events at an auditorium (option C) or wear travel clothing at a rest area (option D), it is highly unlikely that these seats would specifically be designed for cumbersome clothing. Therefore, based on common sense and the context provided, the most appropriate answer to the question is that the seats designed to accommodate cumbersome clothing were located in a space shuttle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Industrial society, wrote Clark Kerr, president of the University of California at Berkeley, in 1960, might undermine freedom 'in the workplace,' but the compensation was the greater range of 'alternatives in goods and services,' and thus 'a greater scope of freedom' in Americans' 'personal lives.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Clark Kerr never said anything about the industrial society and its impact on our lives; his area of expertise was hydrology.\\"?","completion":"If we analyze the premise \\"Industrial society, wrote Clark Kerr, president of the University of California at Berkeley, in 1960, might undermine freedom 'in the workplace,' but the compensation was the greater range of 'alternatives in goods and services,' and thus 'a greater scope of freedom' in Americans' 'personal lives,' we gather several pieces of information: 1. Clark Kerr was the president of the University of California at Berkeley in 1960. 2. He wrote about the Industrial society and its impact on freedom, both in the workplace and in personal lives. 3. He suggested that while freedom in the workplace may be undermined, there is compensation in the form of a greater range in alternatives in goods and services, increasing the scope of freedom overall. Based on this information, we can make some conclusions regarding the hypothesis \\"Clark Kerr never said anything about the industrial society and its impact on our lives; his area of expertise was hydrology.\\" First, it is clear from the premise provided that Clark Kerr indeed wrote about the industrial society and its impact on Americans' lives, particularly in the context of freedom in both the workplace and personal lives. This directly contradicts the first part of the hypothesis, which claims that Kerr never said anything about this subject. Second, while the premise does not explicitly mention Kerr's area of expertise, it is evident that he had enough understanding and insight to make informed statements about the industrial society and its effects on freedom. While it is possible that he also had expertise in hydrology, the information provided in the premise clearly demonstrates that Kerr did engage in discussions and provided analysis on matters related to the industrial society, which again contradicts the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we can infer that the hypothesis \\"Clark Kerr never said anything about the industrial society and its impact on our lives; his area of expertise was hydrology\\" is most likely incorrect. The premise directly provides evidence that Kerr wrote about the industrial society and its influence on freedom in both the workplace and personal lives, contrary to the claim made in the hypothesis. Furthermore, while the premise does not provide explicit information on Kerr's area of expertise, it does demonstrate that he was knowledgeable and active in discussing matters related to the industrial society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Bicycle Thieves Movie plot: The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, an unemployed man in the depressed post-World War II economy of Italy. With no money and a wife and two children to support, he is desperate for work. He is delighted to at last get a good job hanging up posters, but on the sole condition that he has a bicycle which must be used for work. He is told unequivocally: \\"No bicycle, no job.\\" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker.Early on in the film, Ricci's coveted bicycle is stolen by a bold young thief who snatches it when he is hanging up a poster.Antonio thinks that the police will take the theft very seriously, but they are not really interested in the petty theft of a bike. The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts. However, she merely doles out to him one of the truisms that form her stock in trade: \\"you'll find the bike quickly, or not at all.\\" Feeling cheated, a crestfallen Antonio hands over to her some of the last money that they have. After a rare treat of a meal in a restaurant, Antonio admits to his son that if he isn't able to work, they will simply starve.Antonio finally manages to locate the thief (who, it seems, had already sold the bicycle) and Bruno slips off to summon the police to the apartment. Antonio meanwhile, angrily accuses the thief of stealing his bike but the boy denies all knowledge of the crime. When the policeman arrives, he sees the accused boy lying on the floor feigning a seizure and surrounded by irate neighbours who blame Antonio's accusations for causing the \\"innocent\\" boy's fit.The policeman tells Antonio that although he may have seen the boy stealing the bike, he did... My question: Why is Antonnio so desperate to find work? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Antonio is so desperate to find work because he is currently unemployed and facing a difficult financial situation in the economically depressed post-World War II Italy. With no money and a wife and two children to support, he is under immense pressure to provide for his family's basic needs, including food, shelter, and clothing. The lack of job opportunities only exacerbates his desperation, making it even more crucial for him to secure any form of employment that becomes available. The prospect of getting a good job hanging up posters offers him a lifeline to improve his family's living conditions, but it comes with the stipulation that he must have a bicycle to use for work. This requirement underscores not only the importance of the bicycle to his livelihood but also intensifies his desperation to find work and to recover the stolen bicycle. As the film progresses, the gravity of Antonio's situation becomes even more apparent, with him admitting to his son that if he cannot work, they will simply starve. His desperation to find work and reclaim his stolen bicycle is a reflection of the harsh economic realities of the time and the significant impact that unemployment can have on an individual and their family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Cancer Bats are a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario. They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band. The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows. On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores.

Question: What happens to a woman walking her dog in a darkened city street? Movie title: C.H.U.D. Movie plot: The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved (and eaten), and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building.

Based on the premise \\"Together with LSC's 1998 Program Letters, this decision provided the impetus for more serious discussion of program configuration which resulted in the formation of a single statewide program, Colorado Legal Services, effective October 1, 1999.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"A single statewide program helped make legal services more uniform in the state.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"Together with LSC's 1998 Program Letters, this decision provided the impetus for more serious discussion of program configuration which resulted in the formation of a single statewide program, Colorado Legal Services, effective October 1, 1999,\\" we can tentatively conclude that the hypothesis \\"A single statewide program helped make legal services more uniform in the state\\" is likely true. However, to establish the validity of the hypothesis, let us delve deeper into the factors leading to the formation of Colorado Legal Services and the potential impact it may have had on the uniformity of legal services in the state. First, it is important to examine the context in which the single statewide program was introduced. The 1998 Program Letters from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) mentioned in the premise likely offered guidelines or recommendations for improving the delivery of legal aid services. This, in conjunction with other decisions, led to increased dialogue and eventually the establishment of Colorado Legal Services on October 1, 1999. The formation of a unified statewide program was presumably based on the belief that it could optimize the delivery and consistency of legal services across the state. Now, let us explore the potential benefits of a single statewide program in achieving more uniform legal services. 1. Centralized management and oversight: By consolidating legal services under a single organization, management can more effectively allocate resources, set service standards, and monitor the performance of service providers across the state. This centralized oversight could contribute to greater uniformity in the quality and delivery of legal aid services in different regions. 2. Streamlined service delivery: With a single program in place, clients seeking legal assistance may encounter fewer bureaucratic obstacles, as they only need to deal with one entity providing services. This simplification could enhance the consistency of the client experience and improve the overall accessibility of legal services. 3. Shared best practices: As part of a statewide program, individual service providers can more easily collaborate and learn from one another. Identifying, promoting, and implementing best practices across different offices and regions can lead to an increased level of uniformity and quality of service. 4. Resource allocation: A single statewide program can help ensure that resources are allocated evenly and efficiently, minimizing disparities in the availability of legal services across the state. 5. Consistent training: Having a single statewide program can enable the development of a standard curriculum or training program for service providers to ensure that all staff possess the necessary knowledge and skills to serve clients in a consistent manner. However, it is also worth noting that the establishment of a single statewide program may not guarantee the uniformity of legal services without additional efforts to continuously monitor, assess, and improve its performance. As such, it would be useful to gather empirical data on the effectiveness and uniformity of legal services in Colorado following the formation of Colorado Legal Services. In conclusion, although the hypothesis \\"A single statewide program helped make legal services more uniform in the state\\" is likely true based on the given premise, further investigation and evidence would be needed to conclusively validate the hypothesis. The potential benefits of a single statewide program, such as centralized management, streamlined service delivery, shared best practices, resource allocation, and consistent training, should be considered, while also recognizing the importance of ongoing efforts to evaluate and enhance the program's performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Find the latest data on Canada's national debt. 2. Find the latest data on Canada's GDP (Gross Domestic Product). 3. Divide the national debt by the GDP and multiply the result by 100 to get the debt-to-GDP ratio. Step 1: Finding Canada's national debt A reliable source for the national debt of countries is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to the IMF, as of October 2021, Canada's national debt is approximately 2.6 trillion CAD. Step 2: Finding Canada's GDP According to the IMF, Canada's GDP for 2021 is estimated to be about 1.8 trillion CAD. Step 3: Calculating the debt-to-GDP ratio Now, I will divide the national debt by the GDP and multiply the result by 100. Debt-to-GDP Ratio = (National Debt / GDP) * 100 = (2.6 trillion CAD / 1.8 trillion CAD) * 100 = 1.44 * 100 = 144% As of October 2021, the latest data suggests that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio is approximately 144%. Remember that the numbers might slightly differ depending on the data source or the time when the information is updated.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: After lots of hype, the new iPhone 3GS has arrived, boasting an improved camera, better battery life, and speedier performance. But is it a must? The iPhone 3GS is available in two versions: 16GB and 32GB. The 16GB version costs 199, while the 32GB version costs 299. From the outside, the iPhone 3GS looks exactly like the iPhone 3G. Like the iPhone 3G, the new model comes in black and white versions, and sports a 3.5-inch touch screen. Most of the changes to the iPhone 3GS have been made on the inside. Apple says that battery life is better, but the biggest boost is in the iPhone's speed: The iPhone 3GS runs twice as fast as the iPhone 3G. Instead of a lot of software installed on it, the iPhone 3GS comes with the most recent version of the iPhone Software --version 3.0- installed, but it does come with easy access to Apple's App Store. The speedier performance of the iPhone 3GS extends to surfing the Web, too. You can see entire Web pages, and can zoom in and out with ease. The notable new messaging feature on the iPhone 3GS is support for MMS. You can send pictures and videos by SMS, rather than having to send them via e-mail. Other new and very-handy e-mail features include the ability to search through your e-mail messages and contacts, as well as the option to use a landscape-oriented keyboard when composing messages. The camera has been upgraded from 2 megapixels to 3 megapxiels, and adds auto-focus. If you already own an iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS may not be worth the additional cost, since you can get many of its cool features for free with the iPhone 3.0 software upgrade. But if you've been using an older iPhone or smart phone, or are new to the smart phone world, the iPhone 3GS will amaze you with its speed and plentiful features.

News article: President Trump expects his next Supreme Court pick “to go very quickly” and is unlikely to ask his nominee’s position on the landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion rights case, he said in a wide-ranging interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” Trump said abortion rights \\"could very well end up\\" being determined on a state-by-state basis after a new Supreme Court justice is seated, but the president said he \\"probably\\" would not ask his pick to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy how they would vote on Roe v. Wade. “But I’m putting conservative people on,” Trump said. Trump predicted the new Supreme Court nominee, whom he has vowed to name on July 9, would be approved by the Senate \\"very quickly,\\" with \\"a lot of support.\\" The president then took on Democrats who are calling for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), saying the rhetoric would backfire in the upcoming midterms. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio both called for the agency to be eliminated this week. 'ABOLISH ICE' MOVEMENT GOES MAINSTREAM AMONG TOP DEMOCRATS \\"Well I hope they keep thinking about it,\\" Trump said. \\"Because they’re going to get beaten so badly. You know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out. Because they're much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. \\"And these are the ones – you get rid of ICE, you’re going to have a country that you’re going to be afraid to walk out of your house,\\" Trump added. The president also referenced comments by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., encouraging Democrats to harass Trump officials in public. \\"You get rid of ICE, you’re going to have a country that you’re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.\\" — President Trump \\"Between Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, and getting rid of ICE and having open borders, and the biggest thing you have open borders. All it’s going to do is lead to massive, massive crime. That’s going to be their platform, open borders which equals crime. I think they’ll never win another election. So I’m actually quite happy about it.\\" Trump also continued his tough talk on iconic manufacturer Harley-Davidson, which announced last week that it would move some of its production operations out of the U.S. to remain competitive in the face of trade unrest between the U.S. and Europe. \\"They made this deal at the beginning of the year, long before they ever heard of the word tariff,\\" Trump charged. \\"And I don’t think they should do it. I think that Harley is an American bike. It’s an American motorcycle and they should build them in this country. They shouldn’t play cute.\\" The president claimed that the bike manufacturer's move would alienate its customers, without eroding his political support from his base. \\"I guarantee you everybody that ever bought a Harley Davidson voted for Trump,\\" the president said. \\"I don’t know if you know that. I would have to – they call them bikers for Trump. There’s hundreds. And they’re very unhappy about it.\\" ||||| Published on Jul 1, 2018 President Trump speaks out on replacing Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court, the U.S. economy and trade deals in part 1 of his interview with Maria Bartiromo on 'Sunday Morning Futures.'

Answer:","completion":"Based on the review provided, it appears that the customer was dissatisfied with the product. The title, \\"Coda = End, Finito,\\" suggests a sense of finality and disappointment, as the words \\"End\\" and \\"Finito\\" both signify the conclusion of something. The use of these words in the title may indicate the customer's unhappiness with the product and the diminishing expectations they had for the final outcome. The review itself reveals further clues. The customer mentioned they had been waiting \\"years\\" to purchase the product and presumably had high expectations. However, they were left \\"disappointed\\" and described the band as \\"going through the motions.\\" This phrasing implies a lack of passion and creativity from the band, as they didn't deviate from their typical processes or explore new musical avenues. Furthermore, the customer's reference to being a \\"Zep fan\\" indicates that they had a strong attachment to the band and were more likely to find enjoyment in their work. The fact that this reviewer, a self-professed fan, feels let down by the product only strengthens the conclusion that they were dissatisfied.

They had always been inseparable, sharing secrets and dreams while roaming through the halls of the school. One thing that set them apart, however, was their relationship with sweets. Carrie had always struggled with her sweet tooth. Desserts, chocolate, and candy had always been her weakness, and she just couldn't resist indulging herself whenever she got the chance. Despite her love for sweets, she had managed to maintain a small waistline, thanks to her strict workout routine and healthy diet. Carrie had mastered the art of maintaining the perfect balance between treating herself to sweet indulgences now and then without damaging her figure. Rebecca, on the other hand, never really had an issue with sweet treats. She preferred the taste of savory and spicy dishes, and her snacks of choice were usually chips and dips. Rebecca was quite content with an occasional dessert during celebrations, but she rarely craved sweet delights. Like her friend, she had always been conscious about her diet, but it seemed to come naturally to her since she didn't have the same penchant for sweets as Carrie did. As the years passed, Carrie and Rebecca found themselves attending college on opposite sides of the country. They remained best friends, continuously chatting over the phone and sharing stories about their new lives. Carrie had confided in Rebecca that she was struggling to maintain her small waistline while being away from home. The stress of college caused her cravings for sweets to increase, but she didn't have the same motivation or access to her usual workout routine. Understanding her friend's predicament, Rebecca offered to help Carrie develop some new strategies to cope with her cravings and stressful situations. They devised a plan to avoid high-calorie sweets, as well as setting daily goals for exercise and healthy eating. Their shared mission strengthened their bond as they supported and encouraged each other in their efforts to maintain their slim figures in the face of temptation. As Carrie began to adjust to her new lifestyle, she found that her cravings were less intense, and she was learning to recognize and respond to her body's cues more effectively. Rebecca was proud of her friend for taking control of her cravings and developing a healthier attitude towards sweets. Meanwhile, she continued to enjoy her savory treats, knowing that she had Carrie's support in staying conscious of her diet. Carrie and Rebecca proved that maintaining a small waistline was achievable, even with the challenges they both faced. Their commitment to their health and fitness, along with their strong friendship, enabled them to conquer their cravings, manage their stress and maintain their enviable figures. Throughout their lives, Carrie and Rebecca never let their differences get in the way of their friendship. Their ability to understand and support each other's unique struggles is a testament to the depth of connection and mutual respect they shared.

When doctors urge overweight kids to pick up more activities,reading probably isn't what they have in mind. Yet a new study by fatness researchers at Duke University finds that the simple act of reading--depending on the choice of material--can cause weight loss in teenage girls. The study's experimental group included 31 fat girls aged 9 to 13,who took part in the Healthy Lifestyles Program at Duke Children's Hospital. The girls read a novel called Lake Rescue,whose protagonist is an overweight teenager who struggles with low selfesteem,feelings of loneliness and teasing because of her size. A group of 33 girls read a different book called Charlotte in Paris,which did not have an overweight character,and another group of 17 girls read neither book. At the end of the sixmonth experiment,all the girls who read books had lost weight,but the girls who read Lake Rescue lost more. They lowered their body mass index (BMI) by 0.71,compared with 0.33 in the Charlotte group,an average 0.05 increase among the nonreaders. The idea behind the study,says Dr Sarah Armstrong,director of Healthy Lifestyles,was to find a way to encourage the girls without adopting the restrictive and often authoritative voice of so many other nutrition and diet programs. Lake Rescue was the perfect instrument,says Armstrong;it presents a likable character to whom the girls could relate and whom they could learn from. As the book progresses,its protagonist learns to make healthier lifestyle choices and finds an adviser to help keep her on track.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that: This is also called diffusion, and the process is much faster in gases than in liquids, because the particles in gases are further apart. Answer the question: Will induces diffusion in a gas and a liquid. The gas likely diffuses much faster or slower? A:","completion":"Induced diffusion in a gas and a liquid refers to the process wherein particles within these two mediums spread from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. This can be driven by factors such as concentration gradients, temperature, and pressure changes. Considering the key factors that influence diffusion, we can determine that the gas will likely diffuse much faster as compared to the liquid. The following reasons support this conclusion: 1. Particle arrangement: Gases and liquids have different particle arrangements due to their respective states of matter. In gases, particles are distributed more sporadically and are further apart, resulting in increased freedom of movement. In liquids, particles are closer together, limiting their ability to move as freely. Consequently, the increased distance between particles in gases allows them to diffuse at a faster rate. 2. Kinetic energy and particle speed: Another factor that plays a crucial role in diffusion is the kinetic energy of the particles. Kinetic energy is directly related to both the mass and the speed of a particle. Gaseous particles generally possess higher kinetic energy and move faster than their liquid counterparts due to their lower densities. As a result, they are more likely to collide with other particles and cause diffusion to occur at a faster pace. 3. Intermolecular forces: Intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, are typically stronger in liquids than in gases. These forces restrict the movement of particles within the liquid, hindering the diffusion rate. In contrast, gases have weaker intermolecular forces, allowing their particles to move more freely and quickly, thereby increasing the diffusion rate. 4. Temperature dependence: The temperature of a substance can also impact its diffusion rate. Generally, higher temperatures result in increased diffusion rates due to the increased kinetic energy of the particles. Gases are inherently more responsive to temperature changes than liquids, as their particles are separated by larger distances, allowing them to absorb and distribute the added energy more efficiently. This responsiveness results in faster diffusion rates for gases when exposed to comparable temperature changes. In summary, induced diffusion in a gas is likely to occur at a much faster rate than in a liquid due to the differences in particle arrangement, kinetic energy, intermolecular forces, and temperature sensitivity between these two mediums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Buster the dog set to be put down takes risk assessment The fate of a Staffordshire bull terrier sentenced to be put down for eating part of its dead owner still hangs in the balance. Last week, a District Judge decided the nine-year-old bull terrier, referred to as both Buster and Butch, should be put down following the grim find last in Waterloo last September. Merseyside Police, who’d applied for the destruction order, claimed the dog was aggressive when it was later dealt with by one of their handlers, PC Stuart Davidson, who was bitten. The dead owner’s family also wanted the pet put down, believing it to be dangerous. Watch: Buster's risk assessment Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video But solicitors acting for Freshfields Animal Rescue Centre, in Sefton, and The Senior Staffy Club, based in Worcester, have lodged appeal to give the pet a final chance for survival, meaning it will remain alive until the outcome of that legal hearing. James Parry, representing those two organisations, said his clients were ‘very disappointed’ by the ruling at Liverpool Magistrates Court, adding there had been numerous offers to rehome Buster, or Butch. Mr Parry, from Parry Welch Lacey LLP, based in Huyton, told the ECHO: “There has been a great deal of public support for this animal, suggesting this animal should not be destroyed. “There was no evidence in this case that the dog killed the deceased. “We believe the tests applied to check on the animal were not appropriate and outdated. The ‘alpha-role’ was adopted by the doghandler, anticipating the dog was going to bite him - it’s an outdated tactic. “It was a form of assessment which should not have been used. “Dogs are scavengers by nature, but when they can’t get food, they will get anything that is available to them, as was in this case. “Humans, put in the same (starving) position, would do the same. We believe there are good prospects of succeeding at appeal.” Mr Parry also added that claims the bull terrier had attacked and killed a Chihuahua in a separate incident were unfounded, describing that case as relating to a different dog. District Judge Wendy Lloyd last week ruled the Staffy did ‘constitute a danger to public safety.’ A Merseyside Police spokesman said: “We welcome the decision of the court. “This dog was found in a highly agitated state in the home of its owner, who had suddenly died, and was extremely aggressive towards officers who attended. “Even after a lengthy period in police kennels, where the dog was socialised with other dogs and had regular walks with dog handlers, he unfortunately remained aggressive in certain situations. “Video evidence shown in court demonstrated the dog’s tendency to bite when rolled on his tummy and picked up - both of which would happen if the dog was adopted as a family pet. “The police simply cannot take the risk of allowing a dog which has highly aggressive tendencies remain in the community where it could seriously injure someone. “We offer our condolences to the family of the dog’s owner, who died in sudden circumstances, and we are pleased that this outcome is the one that they wanted.” ||||| The court agreed - but solicitors acting for Freshfields Animal Rescue Centre and the Senior Staffy Club have lodged an appeal, giving the animal a temporary reprieve pending a legal hearing. “There has been a great deal of public support for this animal, suggesting this animal should not be destroyed,\\" said solicitor James Parry, representing the organisations acting on Buster's behalf. “There was no evidence in this case that the dog killed the deceased. “We believe the tests applied to check on the animal were not appropriate and outdated. The ‘alpha-role’ was adopted by the doghandler, anticipating the dog was going to bite him - it’s an outdated tactic. “Dogs are scavengers by nature, but when they can’t get food, they will get anything that is available to them, as was in this case. “Humans, put in the same (starving) position, would do the same. We believe there are good prospects of succeeding at appeal.” ||||| Ignorance will soon claim another innocent life- the failing of our inept justice system yet again. It is the unusual setting surrounding this un-heard of case that makes it so unique. In the end, you must be the judge- should this animal really die? Is it truly the fearsome ‘danger to society’ some may have you believe, or simply another unfortunate victim? Yet another court order passed, another judgement final, another dog is to be destroyed. Why? The unfortunate animal was found emaciated and abandoned, feeding off its’ dead owner’s corpse, at their home in Waterloo, U.K. Should He Die? Buster’s Story ‘Dangerous Beast!’ This is likely the first thought going through your head, but look a little deeper. The dog, named both ‘Butch’ and ‘Buster’ in court papers, did not kill his owner, but resorted to this ‘cannibalism’ (for lack of a proper term) only as a last resort- to stay alive, a thing people have done in the past as well. I ask you- what should it have done? What options were available, other than a slow and agonizing starvation? I can also tell you- having studied animal behavior for over 15 years- it is very unusual for any dog to simply ‘pounce’ on their keeper, a longtime member of their pack, their family, the minute they cease to live. Unlike the common house cat, who would likely not give a seconds’ thought to devouring once- beloved owner’s corpse, dogs will often wait nearby, starving. Buster may very well have lasted for days without nourishment. The animal being in such poor condition at the time should attest to the suffering the poor creature was forced to endure. The Struggle For Buster’s Life A fierce legal battle ensued- Merseyside police vs. various local animal rights activists; a battle to decide the dog’s fate. The Worcester-based Senior Staffy Club challenged the police’s claims that the dog was a danger to everyone around it. An experienced veterinarian (Dr. Waterloo, below) was called to examine the animal, ultimately deeming Buster to be a normal, friendly companion, just as deserving as any other. However- local police were met with resistance from the 35 pound traumatized animal (because we all know police have such a spotless reputation when handling dogs), and deemed it a threat to be eliminated. Recorded video of the Veterinarian’s interactions with the dog were submitted in court but dismissed as irreverent by District Judge (and self-proclaimed Canine expert) Wendy Lloyd, who ruled the dog “does constitute a danger to public safety” and said the video was an “assessment which falls well short of what I would expect”. The constable held the squirming animal down, applying obvious force, Buster attempting to wriggle free. When he lifted the dog to transport, the constable was bitten. I have to interject. Really? And you blame the dog for this? A point was made- the police unlawfully seized the animal upon arrival at the residence. However, again Lloyed flexed her mighty judicial powers, dismissing the clear violation of law as ‘seizure of evidence’. It was also pointed out- this has happened before in rural areas. It is not uncommon for animals to feed off of their deceased owners when left alone for long periods of time. Mr. James Cullen, representing the police, commented- When pressured, the dog did not act in a safe fashion. Something very serious could happen. Again, what did you expect? What dog breed was Buster? A Stafford-shire Bull Terrier, conceived in 19th century Britain as an agile fighting breed. Just because they were bred to fight other dogs does not mean they are bad with people; in fact, as nearly any educated enthusiast would agree- these dogs have severely misunderstood reputations, and are in fact some of the absolute best family dogs an owner can find. Anywhere. Buster’s Story in Perspective Buster not only lost his owner, a person he had lived with for who knows how long; he (a pack animal) was forced to live alone, feeding off of the remains of his dead owner to stay alive! Instead of releasing the animal to the accepting care of trained professionals well accustomed to rehabilitating dogs like Buster, the decision was made to simply end his life. What do you think? Should the dog live or die? The judgement has been passed, but only recently; he yet lives (4-18-2016). ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Buster, a nine-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, was sentenced to be put down for eating part of its dead owner.

Review: I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue I've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it.

This conclusion can be drawn from the various criticisms mentioned, which include the unfunny nature of the presumed comedy, the wastage of a good cast on a poorly written script, dull dialogues, and lack of plot. Moreover, the reviewer indicates that the movie's low vote count on the site, despite having renowned stars, reflects its poor quality. Lastly, the reviewer suggests that the movie's existence is likely due to the creators' connections or wealth rather than its merits as a film. A few positive remarks such as the presence of a good cast and some visually appealing shots do not outweigh the overwhelmingly negative tone of the overall review."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The original statement says \\"A white puppy walks down a dirt path trailing his leash on the ground behind him.\\" This statement gives specific information about the puppy's color, its action, the location, and the state of its leash. 2. The statement \\"A puppy is walking down a dirt path\\" contains three main components: \\"a puppy\\", \\"is walking\\", and \\"down a dirt path.\\" 3. Let's now analyze if these three components are present in the original statement. a. \\"a puppy\\" - The original statement mentions \\"a white puppy\\". Thus, it fulfills the requirement of informing about a puppy. b. \\"is walking\\" - The original statement says \\"walks down a dirt path\\". The verb \\"walks\\" indicates that the puppy is walking. Therefore, this component is present in the original statement. c. \\"down a dirt path\\" - The original statement also reports that the white puppy walks \\"down a dirt path\\". This aspect of the statement is unchanged in both the original statement and the statement we're testing for logical consistency. 4.

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

The Special Representative of the United Nations Human Rights Commission on Iran is tasked with investigating, documenting, and assessing the human rights situation in the country. Their findings are reported to the United Nations General Assembly, which then adopts resolutions to address the situation and make recommendations for change. Some of the key concerns raised by these reports and resolutions include the Iranian government's crackdown on freedom of expression, assembly, and association; the use of torture and inhumane treatment in detention centers; and the high number of executions, including those of juvenile offenders. The international community's emphasis on Iran's human rights situation also helps raise public awareness of the issues at hand. By bringing these concerns to the forefront of global discourse, activists and organizations can build support for measures that protect and promote human rights in Iran.

Kobe Bryant, Other Stars May Look to China if NBA Lockout Drags On NBA team owners last week crossed the Rubicon, locking out the players as negotiations over a new labor agreement fell apart. But while the owners and the players union battle over how to split the league’s roughly 4 billion worth of revenue, an extended lockout could bring China’s basketball fans a barnstorming tour featuring one of the game’s brightest stars. The Los Angeles Times reports that Kobe Bryant is considering an exhibition tour in China, where his jersey has long been the No. 1 seller. The newspaper said the Los Angeles Lakers megastar and his agent, Rob Pelinka, are trying to put together the tour with a number of players, citing Minnesota Timberwolves rookie forward Derrick Williams. Williams, who is also represented by Pellinka, was drafted second out of the University of Arizona in last month’s NBA draft, and said he would like to join such a tour. An exhibition league in China for U.S. pros isn’t a unique idea—SportsBusiness Journal reported that Wasserman Media Group, which also represents a number of NBA players, including this season’s most valuable player, Derrick Rose, in April began pitching an exhibition tournament in China in case of an extended lockout. All the reports are careful to state that such plans are still at a very preliminary stage—it seems clear that most parties want to hammer out an agreement and get on with the next NBA season on time. But with such an acrimonious split and grim prospects for a quick resolution, a number of players are examining other options if NBA arenas remain dark. Bryant’s Laker teammate Pau Gasol has said he would prefer to return to his native Spain to play ball if the season is canceled but said China was a possible alternative. The New York Daily News is feeding the rumor mill too, saying that New York Knicks forward Amar’e Stoudamire would consider joining Bryant’s Chinese tour if he couldn’t play in the NBA, citing a person close to the all-star.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence, we need to analyze both sentences and establish their relation. Let's break down each sentence: Sentence 1: And then I saw, right in front of my eyes, on the deck of the carrier, a chief petty officer sliced into three parts by a propeller blade. This sentence states that the speaker witnessed a gruesome event on the deck of the carrier, where a chief petty officer was cut into three parts by a propeller blade. This indicates that the event took place on a carrier, likely a ship or an aircraft carrier, with a propeller in its system. Sentence 2: The carrier has a deck area for observation on it. This sentence provides information about the carrier mentioned in the first sentence. It tells us that the carrier is fitted with a deck area that can be used for observation. Now, we can analyze the relationship between these sentences. Both sentences are referring to the same carrier. Based on the information presented, we can determine that the carrier indeed has a deck area as mentioned in Sentence 2. This is because the first sentence talks about an event that took place on the deck of the carrier. However, Sentence 2 specifically mentions that the deck area is for observation purposes, and the first sentence does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this particular claim. While it's possible that the observation deck was the location where the tragic incident happened, the information provided in Sentence 1 does not give enough details to accurately state the purpose of the deck area. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the first sentence, we can confirm that the carrier has a deck area as mentioned in the second sentence.

In the 1964 film, the character of Mary Poppins was played by Julie Andrews. In the 2018 sequel, Emily Blunt took on the role. Therefore, the correct response to the question should mention either Julie Andrews or Emily Blunt depending on which film is being referred to. The suggested answer states: \\"It was shot at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.\\" This information, although true, does not provide the answer to the question being asked since it encompasses the location where the movie was shot rather than the actress who played Mary Poppins. Consequently, this answer should not be validated as it does not correctly address the question. To provide a valid response, you should instead focus on the actresses who played Mary Poppins in each film.

Step 2: Analyze the provided statement The statement provides information about the development of the 45 rpm format by RCA Victor in March 1949 and implies that there was another format developed in secret. Step 3: Determine if the statement is sufficient to answer the question The statement only provides information about one format that replaced the 78 rpm - the 45 rpm format by RCA Victor. It does not explicitly mention the other format, but implies that there was one. Step 4: Provide a more complete answer A more complete answer would include the name of the other format that replaced the 78 rpm along with the 45 rpm format, as well as any relevant information about the development of that format. Answer: The provided statement partially answers the question, as it mentions that the 45 rpm format by RCA Victor replaced the 78 rpm format. However, for a more complete answer, it would be important to mention the other format as well, which is the 33⅓ rpm long-play (LP) format introduced by Columbia Records in June 1948. So, the two formats that replaced the 78 are the 45 rpm (developed by RCA Victor and marketed in March 1949) and the 33⅓ rpm LP (developed by Columbia Records and marketed in June 1948)."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a passage and have to answer a question based on your understanding of the events inferred from the passage.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the fastest ways to get sick is to interact with a sick person or go out in public without washing your hands before you touch your face. Bacteria and viruses can quickly spread through direct contact, so it's important to wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly — before and after eating, after using the bathroom, after touching your face, etc. This will also keep you from spreading your germs to others when you have a cough. Keep hand sanitizer with you to help disinfect your hands when you are out in public or at work. Remind your child not to put her fingers in her mouth or eyes, as germs are often spread this way. Use a tissue when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs through the air. This will also help you avoid letting other bacteria or viruses into your lungs when you inhale. If you don’t have a tissue on hand, sneeze or cough into your elbow rather than cupping your hands over your face. This helps you avoid spreading germs to your hands and them onto other objects as well. Allergens irritate your sinuses, which causes congestion that can lead to difficulty breathing, trigger postnasal drip, and aggravate the throat. Allergies happen when your immune system produces antibodies to fight free radicals by releasing chemical such as histamine, which can cause inflammation and allergy symptoms. Flower pollen, dust, and mold are some of the most common allergens.

It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people on each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover in between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get quite a workout running for the ball after each volley. If you are looking for that relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard ground, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a playground. When a player trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body. While he needs to be able to hit the ball with a great deal of power and accuracy , strengthening his legs is extremely important. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be very exciting and fun.

The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.

For example, in the Computer Programme, students learn the basic computer programming, and how to use the Internet. In the Tech-Camp Programme, they make radio-controlled model cars and produce their own short videos.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: threat and non-threat. Threat is a statement that someone will be hurt or harmed, especially if the person does not do something in particular. Input: Comment: and still 1000 x smarter that any left winger like you Output:","completion":"Non-threat Explanation: The provided comment does not contain any statement suggesting someone will be hurt or harmed. It's just a comparison of intelligence between the commenter and the person they are responding to. Therefore, it's classified as a non-threat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. This question has options. Answer the question about text: When Wang of the Chinese team took a medical time out to have an elbow massaged , the commentators seized the moment to point out how this particular player was notorious for faking medical attention , while providing only laughable supporting evidence . And did I mention that the coverage was relentless ? When I think about the number of sports that did n't get any prime time coverage , it occurred to me that the May / Walsh coverage did constitute something of a \\" perfect storm \\" for the NBC agenda . Why did the media criticize Wang ? pick from the following. (a). The think the injury would make prime time coverage .. (b). The think he is seriously injured .. (c). The think he is a poor player .. (d). The think he is faking his symptoms ..","completion":"The media criticized Wang because (d). They think he is faking his symptoms. The commentators talked about Wang being known for pretending to need medical attention without having strong evidence to support their claim."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Teacher:A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: x = 9, equation weights = [5, 4, 2] Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the problem. To solve the given instance, we need to substitute the value of x in the polynomial equation represented by the equation weights and calculate the result. Given value of x = 9 Equation weights = [5, 4, 2] The equation weights represent the polynomial: 5x^2 + 4x + 2 Now, we need to substitute the value of x (9) and calculate the result. Result = 5*(9^2) + 4*9 + 2 Let's calculate it step by step: 1. Compute 9^2: 9^2 = 81 2. Multiply the obtained value with the first weight (5): 5 * 81 = 405 3. Multiply the value of x (9) with the second weight (4): 4 * 9 = 36 4. Add the obtained values from steps 2, 3, and the third weight (2): 405 + 36 + 2 = 443 So, the result of the polynomial expression is 443."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
