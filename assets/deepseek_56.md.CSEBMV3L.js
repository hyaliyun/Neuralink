A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college. - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia . This agency is under Ministry of Education . The PTPTN 's Chairman is Shamsul Anuar Nasarah , member of the Malaysian Parliament for the seat of Lenggong in Perak . - Postgraduate education, or graduate education in North America, involves learning and studying for academic or professional degrees, academic or professional certificates, academic or professional diplomas, or other qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is required, and it is normally considered to be part of higher education.

Justin stood in front of Benjamin which completely hid them from view behind them since","completion":"both boys were quite tall for their age. They were about to embark on what they believed was going to be the adventure of a lifetime. They had discovered an old, tattered map in Justin's grandfather's attic, and were now determined to follow it to its mysterious destination. The attic had long been the source of many wistful tales and lore, stories passed down from generation to generation in the small town where they lived. The boys had heard whispers of treasure, ghosts, and secret passages, always instilling in them the thrill of the unknown. When they had first uncovered the rolled-up parchment, yellowed with age and painstakingly etched with cryptic symbols, they knew they had stumbled upon something special. The winding path on the map led through the dense forest that bordered their town, making its way up to the highest peak and back down into a hidden valley, where a small 'x' marked what they hoped would be a place filled with treasures beyond their wildest dreams. It was this hope, this greedy yearning for ancient riches, that drove the boys to hatch a plan to follow the path in secret. They didn't want to alert their parents or bring others into their exclusive adventure, so they carefully gathered supplies and researched as much as possible about navigation, survival, and wilderness exploration. To keep their quest under wraps, they decided to embark on their journey before dawn, while the rest of the town was still asleep, allowing them ample time to navigate the forest's edge before anyone realized they were gone. That morning, as the sky turned a pale blue and the first hints of the sun began to peek over the horizon, they set out, Justin leading the way with the map firmly in his grip and Benjamin carrying their collective supplies in a backpack. The first part of their journey went smoothly; they followed the trail on the map, always keeping the forest to their right, and in no time at all, they found the first of many markers whispered about in those ancient tales – a gnarled and twisted tree, its limbs intertwined to form an eerily precise circle at the center – just as the map indicated. They continued to trek further, following the path that now led them deeper into the forest. The sunlight filtering through the canopy above dappled their surroundings in a mosaic of light and shadow, the sounds of birdsong and rustling leaves filling their ears. As they traveled, they discovered more markers that matched those on the map: peculiar rock formations, streams that abruptly began or ended, and an assortment of oddly-shaped trees that seemed too strange to have grown naturally. After what felt like an entire day of walking, they found themselves at the base of the mountain peak that loomed in the distance from their small town. The map indicated a challenging climb, leading to a hidden cave entrance high above. With determination in their eyes, the boys began the ascent, their excitement for the treasure propelling them upward. As they climbed, the sun sank lower in the sky, casting golden rays across the mountainside. The winds grew colder with each foot the boys scaled, but they pressed on, driven by the tantalizing mystery of the 'x' on the map. When they finally arrived at the cave entrance, dusk was upon them, and they settled down to rest and recuperate. Ignoring the biting wind and the shadows creeping in from the edges of the cave, they shared the meager provisions they had brought and studied the final stretch of the map. It seemed to indicate that the treasure lay hidden somewhere deep within the mountain, in a chamber accessible only through a labyrinth of tunnels. Gulping down the final, dry bites of their meal, Justin and Benjamin stiffly rose to their feet, steeled their nerves, and stepped into the darkened cavern, the faint beams from their flashlights cutting through the pitch-black void as they ventured into the unknown. As they navigated the winding tunnel system, a growing unease began to settle within them, as though they were being watched. The walls seemed to close in on them, and every so often, they caught movement in the periphery of their vision, an unsettling presence just beyond the reach of their lights. But with each step closer they took, the boys could not help but feel the overpowering allure of the treasure, the promise of wealth and untold secrets that lay just a little further down the path. And it was with this pursuit of knowledge, riches, and fame that Justin and Benjamin descended deeper into the mountain, unaware of the larger forces they had tapped into by unearthing that fateful, ancient map. Little did they know that, beyond the darkness of the labyrinth, a world of magic, forgotten history, and grave danger awaited them. With each step forward, the boys were entwining themselves with a legacy that had been lost to time, and they would soon find themselves facing challenges that would not only test their courage and wit but also reveal the true nature of friendship, loyalty, and the weight of destiny."},{"prompt":"Given the question: - clubs is arbroath cardiff city barry town - caps is 40 172 - position is defender - years is 1955 -- 1957 1957 -- 1965 1965 -- ? - birth date is 4 june 1937 - fullname is alexander soutar milne - birth place is dundee , scotland - goals is 0 1 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of person who in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"?, what is it ?

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Here is an article: The denizens of Forbes’ 400 Rich List and Billionaire’s Row would have been ecstatic yesterday when French economist Thomas Piketty, much-heralded author of “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” made his debut at the Kennedy School of Government to a standing room crowd including Harvard faculty members and local investment managers. The entire affair was introduced with splendid reverence by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is bound to be one of the most talked about books of 2014, as it raises to a new crescendo the much-debated and alarming rise in the disparity of wealth not only in the US, but around the globe. It is already the first Harvard University published book to make it to the best-seller list of the New York Times in a very long time. What many will find alarming is Piketty’s prognostication for the ultimate concentration of wealth along 19th century lines: “accumulating that keeps on accumulating,” and assuming a slow growth of the population the “inequality might reach 19th century oligarchic levels.” I suppose that means more and more Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerbergs. Piketty’s research, he claims, suggests that the top of the wealth distribution is growing at a pace three times faster than any other group. He calls the “the return to the patrimonial society,” suggesting that Forbes’ list of billionaires globally is about to become a far larger number of individuals and will be held in even greater powerful positions in their societies than before. The left is going to find this a very scary concept. I await the scathing diatribes against Piketty’s research. However, the economists around me in the crowded Harvard classroom assure me Piketty has collected a mass of statistics comparing the growth of income in relation to the growth of capital, and finds capital expanding at a much greater rate. I thought I heard Piketty allege that the level of taxes is not as salient as the rate of economic growth compared to the accumulation of capital. I guess the simplest way to explain it is that the average rate of stock gains per year over history has been running at 6%-7%, which is about triple the rate of economic growth in the US and Europe right now. So, if you are an entrepreneur with a stock everyone wants to own, your wealth is going to magnify faster than if your holdings expand in line with annual economic growth. Or as Martin Wolf put it in the Financial Times of London: “In normal times capitalists save a sufficiently large share of their returns to ensure that their capital will grow at least as fast as the economy. This is especially likely to be true of the seriously wealthy, who are also likely to enjoy the highest returns. Small fortunes are eaten; big ones are not. The tendency for capital to grow faster than the economy is also more likely when the growth of the economy is relatively slow, either because of demographics or because technical progress is weak.” As we are not seeing moderate rises in wealth, undoubtedly we will be living with immoderate rises in power to the rich. Piketty underscores the predicament of rising inequality. Maybe these new oligarchs had better become subject to ”the far higher marginal tax rates on top incomes and a progressive global wealth tax.” Sounds to me the new oligarchs are going to be emigrating to the low or no wealth tax regimes that will always exist. This debate over Piketty’s books is going to be one of the liveliest intellectual issues of 2014 and beyond. Forbes Magazine ought to be in the forefront of the debate and take a stance on what is most right for the United States economy and democracy.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions.

The whole time I was either vacant of thought, or had a fleeting one which screamed \\"TURN IT OFF!!!\\". But I didn't. And actually, I'm glad I did. The animation is stunning. Very artistic, odd and dark. I personally loved it for the amazing animation, but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myself. A young boy--well, cat--goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part she's lying sick in bed, and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper. Her soul is split in half. One is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lost. Then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me, honestly. I expect they go back, and their world is... perhaps slowly falling apart? Maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this, for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world's in. First there's a giant flood, and next it dries up into a bleak desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to either what is God or fate, as you will see). Then I believe they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, totally didn't get that, but it sends shivers down my spine each time.

Solve this instance: Passage: A few months before the D-Day landings during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than Normandy. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson, is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information. This happens quickly and their aeroplane is (unsuccessfully) attacked on leaving Gibraltar. Question: What is the full name of the character who \\"Jimmy\\" is supposed to impersonate? Student:","completion":"Part #1: Write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. Usage: The full name of the character who \\"Jimmy\\" is supposed to impersonate is General Bernard Montgomery. This answer involves references to multiple entities such as \\"Jimmy,\\" \\"actor,\\" and \\"Monty\\" which all relate to the person (M. E. Clifton James) attempting to impersonate General Montgomery. The answer addresses the question unambiguously, identifying the person to be impersonated. Part #2: The answer to the question should be unambiguous. Usage: General Bernard Montgomery is an unambiguous answer as it is taken directly from the paragraph, not leaving room for confusion about the identity of the character in question. It is specific and clear, unlike just saying \\"Monty\\" or \\"the general.\\" Part #3: The answer should be a phrase in the paragraph. Usage: The phrase \\"General Bernard Montgomery\\" is directly taken from the passage, specifically in the sentence that says, \\"Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery.\\" This part of the passage provides the specific name of the character \\"Jimmy\\" is supposed to impersonate. Part #4: Most questions can have only one correct answer. Usage: In this case, there is only one correct answer to the question, which is General Bernard Montgomery.

Article: The measured Afghanistan endgame that President Obama outlined this week suffered new setbacks Thursday, as the Taliban suspended peace talks with the United States and Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded that NATO withdraw forces from the small, rural outposts that are at the heart of its military mission here. The developments are the latest in a cascade of challenges to the exit that the administration and its coalition partners are planning, including a gradual turnover of security responsibility to Afghan troops, a paced U.S. and NATO withdrawal and a negotiated peace with the Taliban. Administration officials had steeled themselves for fallout after the burning of Korans by U.S. service members last month and the massacre of 16 Afghan civilians Sunday, allegedly by an Army staff sergeant who went on a rampage. But Thursday’s statements caught Western officials in Kabul off guard and sparked new concerns that the U.S.-led operation here could unravel as trust erodes between Afghans and their foreign benefactors. “Afghanistan is ready right now to take all security responsibilities completely,” Karzai said in a statement issued shortly after he met with visiting Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. “To speed up this process, authority should be given to Afghans.” The statement set no deadline for what it called the “withdrawal of international forces from villages.” It reiterated Karzai’s insistence that foreign troops should not be allowed to conduct night raids on Afghan homes. U.S. commanders rely heavily on these operations to net suspected insurgents. Karzai has a long history of making demands that the international community ignores or implements slowly, and he has cried wolf many times. But if he presses ahead with the demand for withdrawal of NATO forces from the countryside, the U.S. military could face many of the same challenges it contended with in Iraq in 2009, as Baghdad sought to curb the movement and authority of American troops. The effect in Afghanistan could be considerably more complex and dangerous. Iraq’s insurgency had begun to wane at the time, but militants in Afghanistan remain strong, despite coalition progress in some areas, and Taliban leaders continue to have sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan. Coalition commanders see the constellation of small outposts in insurgent-plagued provinces as essential to their goal of providing enough security for the Afghan government to take root. That objective remains elusive in much of the country, and the Afghan government, whose military forces are still a work in progress, still depends almost entirely on foreign funding. In a news conference in Washington with visiting British Prime Minister David Cameron on Wednesday, Obama acknowledged “multiple challenges along the way” but said that “in terms of pace, I don’t anticipate at this stage that we’re going to be making any sudden additional changes to the plan that we currently have.” “If we maintain a steady, responsible transition process, which is what we’ve designed, then I am confident that we can put Afghans in a position where they can deal with their own security,” he said. The plan NATO adopted in late 2010 has already undergone some changes. Although it had indicated that the turnover of security responsibility to the Afghans would not be completed until 2014, with NATO combat forces withdrawing by the end of that year, the alliance now hopes to transition to a supporting role throughout the country by the end of next year. Karzai’s statement said the transition should be completed in 2013, and it was unclear whether he was proposing a game plan different from NATO’s. Obama also said that he expected a U.S.-Afghanistan strategic partnership agreement to be completed by the next NATO summit, in Chicago in May. But that agreement, designed to set the terms for a reduced but continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014, has foundered over the issue of night raids. Karzai has “just generally always been concerned that night raids are intrusive and heavy-handed, whereas what we’ve pointed out is that they’re central to our ability to degrade Taliban operations and battlefield leadership,” said a senior administration official in Washington, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. “We’re trying to find the appropriate course of action.” Administration officials played down the significance of the Taliban statement suspending peace talks, describing it as part of a roller coaster they have grown familiar with ever since a series of U.S. meetings with the insurgents, most of them in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar, began in late 2010. But the talks have been stalled for nearly two months, and the new announcement further diminished U.S. hopes that progress could be announced at the NATO meeting as planned. Late last year, agreement was reached between U.S. officials and Tayeb al-Agha, an aide to Taliban leader Mohammad Omar, on the exchange of five Taliban suspects being held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for a Western official held by the insurgents. The Washington Post has withheld the name of the official for safety reasons, at the administration’s request, since the fall. Other elements of the tentative deal included what U.S. officials said would be a Taliban statement recognizing the authority of the Afghan government and renouncing international terrorism, and the establishment of a Taliban office in Qatar. But the plan faltered when Karzai objected, saying he had not been consulted. He later suspended ties with Qatar, where Taliban negotiators had established a beachhead. By January, Karzai reversed course, and U.S. officials said the opening of the Qatar office would also mark the moment when the Afghan government would enter the talks. Congress was briefed on the exchange, under which an initial three Taliban prisoners were to be transferred to house arrest in Qatar, with the other two following 60 days later. Administration optimism rose when an Afghan government delegation visited the Guantanamo prisoners last week and when Karzai announced Saturday that he would send a senior representative to Qatar for talks with that government. But spirits fell again Sunday at news of the massacre of the Afghan civilians. In the Thursday statement, posted on its Web site, the Taliban said it was suspending all talks “until the Americans clarify their stance.” It accused the United States of breaking its promise on the prisoner exchange and imposing a new “list of conditions” — an apparent reference to the statement on international terrorism that the insurgents have yet to make. It also reiterated that Taliban would talk only to the “American invaders” and not to the Karzai government. “Now they say it’s the Americans who are the problem,” said a second administration official, referring to the announcement. “It was too much to expect that nothing would happen” in the wake of Sunday’s incident, he added. DeYoung reported from Washington. Staff writer Greg Jaffe in Kabul contributed to this report. ||||| The Afghan Taliban have announced the suspension of all negotiations with the United States, talks that had been seeking an end to the decade-long war in Afghanistan. \\"The Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend all talks with Americans taking place in Qatar from today onwards until the Americans clarify their stance on the issues concerned and until they show willingness in carrying out their promises instead of wasting time,\\" the armed group said in a statement on Thursday. The statement said the US had continued to change the terms of the negotiations and had presented a \\"list of conditions\\" in their latest meeting that was in contradiction to earlier arrangements. Also on Thursday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded foreign troops pull out of villages, another blow to the US military presence in the country. Karzai's demand came days after a US soldier’s pre-dawn shooting spree in southern Kandahar province left 16 civilians dead. The soldier, an army staff sergeant, was flown out out of Afghanistan to Kuwait on Wednesday. \\"Our demand is that this process should be executed sharply and the responsibility should be handed over to Afghans,\\" Karzai said in a statement after meeting with Leon Panetta, the US secretary of defence. Karzai added that both sides \\"should work towards completing the transition of security responsibilities to Afghan forces in 2013, and not the announced date of 2014\\". A US defence official told Reuters news agency the US does not believe Karzai is seeking immediate pull out from villages. \\"There is a schedule for security transition...and President Karzai did not ask for any change in the current schedule (at the meeting),\\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reporters traveling with Panetta. Oana Lungescu, a NATO spokesperson, said \\"NATO remains committed to enabling the Afghan security forces to take full responsibility for security as soon as practically possible.\\" 'Spiralling downward' According to reports, the Taliban's pre-condition that five of their high-ranking officials be released from US detention in Guantanamo Bay seems to have halted any progress in peace talks. Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, said the Taliban had expected the release of the high-ranking prisoners by now and it seems that they have given up on that happening. \\"I think from the US perspective, you have to see things going from bad to worse in their Afghan policy. All recent events point to a spiralling downward, including the Quran burning incident and then the killings of the 16 villagers, now Karzai is asking the US remove troops. \\"There is sense that the US [policy] is heading to some sort of disarray at the moment.” The Taliban announced the opening of a political office in Qatar in January, what was considered a major step in reaching a compromise agreement to end the 10-year war. Karzai showed little support for the announcement, but eventually endorsed the move. \\"The Americans initially agreed upon taking practical steps regarding the exchange of prisoners and to not oppose our political office but with the passage of time, they turned their backs on their promises,\\" the Taliban statement said. \\"An American representative presented a list of conditions in his latest meeting with the Islamic Emirate which were not only unacceptable but also in contradiction with the earlier agreed upon points.\\" Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington DC, said the situation has certainly raised concerns for US officials. “One thing the officials will be looking at is whether this is a critical blow to the overall peace process about working a reconciliation deal,\\" she said. \\"Is this just political posturing on the part of the Taliban, or whether there are deeper problems in the initial stages of confidence building.” ||||| According to a statement from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), four coalition soldiers have died in Afghanistan. Saturday's deaths, including two soldiers killed in an attack by anti-government fighters in the south, brings the death toll of international troops in Afghanistan to 2,990, since 2001, according to the Reuters news agency. Those four deaths bring the number of soldiers from the NATO-led forces killed this month to 19. Though the Reuters news agency reports 2,990 casualties, including 1,959 US forces since the war began in 2001, icasualties.org, an indepdent website that documents casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, including non-combat deaths, puts the total coalition fatalities at 3,002. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The Taliban suspended peace talks with the United States and Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded NATO withdraw forces from rural outposts in Afghanistan, leading to increased concerns for the planned exit strategy.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: If you sit back and think about nice memories you will be able to? Options: - sit quietly - concentrate - wake up - stay focused - relax Explain why a human would choose \\"relax\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"relax\\" to answer the question above because thinking about nice memories often leads to feelings of comfort, happiness, and contentment. These positive emotions help to counteract stress and anxiety, resulting in an overall sense of relaxation. When one sits back and reflects on pleasant memories, they mentally revisit enjoyable experiences and positive emotions associated with those events. This can help to calm the mind, as it becomes occupied with the feelings of warmth and happiness from those memories. In contrast, other options listed do not necessarily produce the same effect: - Sit quietly: Sitting quietly may not always result in relaxation, especially if one's mind is filled with stressful or distracting thoughts. - Concentrate: Concentrating typically involves focusing one's attention on a task or thought, and while it can be productive, it does not inherently provide the warmth and comfort associated with thinking about nice memories. - Wake up: Waking up does not specifically relate to the act of reflecting on pleasant memories, so it seems unrelated to the goal of relaxation. - Stay focused: Similar to concentration, staying focused requires engaging with a task, thought or activity. While it can be helpful for productivity, it does not imply relaxation or the mental comfort associated with pleasant memories. In summary, the best answer is \\"relax\\" because thinking about nice memories tends to elicit positive emotions and feelings of comfort, which ultimately results in relaxation as the mind and body loosen and unwind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lyrics and music for the theme tune were composed by Mike Moran and Maggie Bell. Mike Moran is a celebrated British keyboard musician, songwriter, and record producer who has worked with prominent musical acts, including Queen and Ozzy Osbourne. To create the theme tune that perfectly fit the tone of the crime series, Moran powerfully fused rock and blues elements into an atmospheric and dark melody, complementing the show's investigative theme. The series \\"Taggart\\" originally featured the character Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Jim Taggart, played by the late actor Mark McManus. Taggart was a tough, no-nonsense Glaswegian detective who was deeply committed to his work and catching criminals. The show continued even after the death of Mark McManus in 1994, and various other lead characters were introduced to keep the captivating spirit of the series alive. Some of these characters included DCI Michael Jardine (played by James MacPherson) and DCI Matt Burke (played by Alex Norton). Over the years, \\"Taggart\\" became known for its memorable catchphrase \\"There's been a murder!\\", often spoken by the lead character.

Write highlights for this article: A mother has warned the medication she takes for her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm – and is now speaking publicly about her experiences of getting it back. U.S. blogger Crista Anne switched antidepressants last year and discovered she was unable to reach climax through masturbation. Experts warn that a delay in the ability to orgasm is a common side-effect of many antidepressants, faced by up to half the people who take them. Crista, a mother-of-three, is now sharing intimate details of her sex life online in order to raise awareness to the side effects of antidepressants. Scroll down for video. U.S. blogger Crista Anne (pictured) has warned the medication she takes to treat her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm. Around half of all antidepressant users experience this effect, an expert has said. Crista has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the years she has tried various treatments including supplements, diets, lifestyle behaviours and the most widely prescribed antidepressants known Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). Last year she switched antidepressants and began taking amitriptyline, an older antidepressant which is no longer used as a first-line treatment. It is thought to block the effects of two chemical messengers called serotonin and norepinephrine, regulating mood and controlling depression. But writing on her blog, Crista says while the medication allows her to 'feel alive for the first time', she began to experience side effects such as sleepiness, a dry mouth and the inability to orgasm. She found ways to cope with the dry mouth and sleepiness, but found the lack of orgasm – or anorgasmia, as it is known medically – a bigger problem. She said on her blog: 'After an IUD [contraceptive coil] installation and starting medications for fibromyalgia and an antidepressant, my orgasm disappeared briefly. 'At the time of recording, with partnered sex I was missing my explosive orgasm. Only experiencing gentle waves. Anorgasmia - the inability to orgasm - is a known side effect of some antidepressants. Crista has blogged about her experiences of anorgasmia, and wants to raise awareness to this side effect. 'While those waves were nice, they were nothing close to the restorative experience I so depend on for a mental, emotional and physical recharge.' ‘A few weeks later I can blissfully report that universe creating powerhouse orgasms have returned via partnered sex. ‘The bad news is that orgasm via masturbation is still gone. Nada. Nil. Nothing.’ She has started a project called #OrgasmQuest, in which she aims to achieve one self-induced orgasm a day, with the hope of regaining her ability to climax through masturbation long term. She tweets updates of whether she has been able to achieve orgasm, to break down stigma. For example:. In her first #OrgasmQuest blog post she describes how being able to orgasm on her own has always helped her battle her depression. She said: 'Masturbating is my zen. It’s my meditation. It’s almost my religion. Masturbation is part of my identity, a part that I am not about to give up on. ‘My high sex drive and orgasmic superpower have been the most dependable parts of my identity. 'Sex has been my go-to pick me up for combating depression, allowing myself to feel something other than the darkness. Until now.' Anorgasmia, or the inability to orgasm, is a common side effect of antidepressants. It is not completely clear why some people experience anorgasmia while taking the drugs. David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, said that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm. He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body. 'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another. 'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. But it also delays time to orgasm.' He explained that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm. 'If you stimulate that serotonin receptor, it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax,' he said. 'There's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation.' However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant. Anorgasmia as a side effect of antidepressants is extremely common, David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, told MailOnline. He said almost half of people who take antidepressants experience this side effect. Globally, more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression, according to WHO figures. In 2011, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified about 11 per cent of people took antidepressants - a 400 per cent increase since the 1980s when previous surveys were taken. In the UK, recent government figures revealed more than 50 million prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England last year. A 2013 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found 4 million people in the UK take SSRIs. Crista says she has already tried a wide range of treatments for depression, and does not want to stop taking amitriptyline. Writing on her blog, she said: 'The anorgasmia is not enough to make me want to get off this medication or try another, as I believe that I can work through and return to some sort of orgasmic state. My libido has not been affected.' She wants to raise awareness to this problem as there is a stigma associated with discussing sexuality in public. This means means many people taking antidepressants might suffer in silence, she says. 'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' she told the Daily Dot. 'While my doctor spoke to me in depth about it, the stories I get from hundreds of other people are horrific.' One woman says multiple partners have left her because of her ability to orgasm. Professor Taylor explains that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm. He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body. 'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another. 'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' Crista said. She believes there is a stigma about talking about orgasm in public, which prevents people taking antidepressants getting help. 'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. 'But it also delays time to orgasm.' He added that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm.

However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant. Antidepressants are a type of medication used to treat depression or prevent it recurring. They can also be used to prevent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is thought antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, can improve mood and emotion, although this process is not fully understood. Increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain. Some of the side effects of antidepressants include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm. Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Some include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm. And while antidepressants can help treat the symptoms of depression, they do not always address its causes. This is why they are usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions caused by emotional distress.

About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.

Detailed Instructions: Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Problem:Context: Anna Foster (Mandy Moore) is the daughter of the President of the United States, James (Mark Harmon) and First Lady Michelle Foster (Caroline Goodall).When a hassle of Secret Service agents ruins a first date, Anna demands some freedom. Her dad agrees to send only two agents with Anna and Gabrielle La Clare (Beatrice Rosen) to a concert when Anna goes to Prague with her parents. A sexy new look for Anna causes her father to renege. When Anna discovers the concert is filled with agents and that her father has broken his promise, Gabrielle helps Anna elude her protectors. Outside the concert, Anna meets Ben Calder (Matthew Goode), and asks him to drive her to escape the agents. Anna goes to a bar with Ben and proceeds to get drunk. Unbeknownst to Anna, Ben is with the Secret Service, and tells agents Alan Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Cynthia Morales (Annabella Sciorra) where Anna is. The President orders the three agents to have Ben guard Anna without telling her who he really is, to give her an illusion of freedom with a guarantee of safety. Believing herself free of her guards for the first time in years, Anna jumps into the Vltava River naked, mistaking it for the Danube, and Ben has to fish her out (he stays clothed). Weiss and Morales buy the camera from someone taking pictures of the skinny-dipping Anna. Anna and Ben climb a rooftop to watch an opera being shown in a plaza, where Anna eventually falls asleep with Ben guarding her, and Weiss and Morales watching from another roof.The next morning, Anna calls her parents to avoid getting into further trouble with them. Knowing she is safe, her father is initially indulgent, and Anna is about to return, but his tone changes when he is shown the photos of her nude in the river. The First Lady, however, asks, \\"What happened to 'let freedom ring?'\\" (That had been his earlier line when he had decided to let her stay out with Ben.) Anna is outraged at both her dad's sudden imperious tone and finding out that he traced her call. She decides to meet Gabrielle at the Love Parade in Berlin and return to her parents right before the plane trip home. Ben goes with her on the train, where they meet Scotty McGruff (Martin Hancock), a flighty romantic obsessed with Six Million Dollar Man stickers and the interconnectivity of the world, he gives them a stack of stickers and tells them to stick them up in random places, then one day when they are unhappy, they will see one and it will make them smile. Through him, the two learn that they have boarded a Venice-bound train. When they arrive in Venice, Ben calls the other agents to tell them where they are but has to leave the phone dangling when he realizes he can no longer see Anna. He finds her and McGruff getting new clothes, and the three explore Venice - until McGruff steals their wallets. Ben is about to tell the cafe they cannot pay when Anna is recognized and races off to avoid being identified as the First Daughter. Ben follows, and they tell a story of marrying, against the wishes of Anna's parents, to get a gondola ride from a kind-hearted gondolier, Eugenio (Joseph Long). Ben kisses Anna during the ride to hide her from the cafe staff's sight. Since they have no place to stay, Eugenio invites them to his and his mother Maria's (Miriam Margolyes) house. That night, thinking the kiss meant that Ben cares for her, Anna offers herself to him. To dissuade her, Ben is disingenuous and harsh. Anna finally gets in the bed alone, while Ben lies on the floor.The next day, Eugenio drives them to the Austrian border, as Weiss and Morales show up at Maria's looking for the gondolier with whom Anna and Ben were last seen. Maria tells them that Anna and Ben are married, which is reported to Anna's parents.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the isotope is more unstable happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, a more unstable isotope can indirectly affect the growth of vegetables, but it won't affect the process you described. Let me explain how. The isotopes we're discussing here are usually radioactive isotopes, such as those of certain elements like uranium, thorium, potassium, etc. When these isotopes are unstable, they can decay and release radioactive particles and energy. This radioactive decay can potentially affect the vegetable growth in several ways, mainly: 1. Soil Contamination: If the isotopes are in the soil, their radioactive decay can release radiation, causing harm to the plants. It can damage plant tissues and impair their ability to photosynthesize, grow, or reproduce. Therefore, it might prevent the seeds from growing into healthy vegetable plants. 2. Water Contamination: If a water source gets contaminated with these isotopes, and if we use that water for watering the seeds/plants, it can potentially harm the plants. The harmful effects would be similar to what happens in the case of soil contamination. However, this perturbation doesn't directly affect the process you listed. You'd still carry out the steps in the same order and in the same manner: get seeds, plant them in a spot, water them, etc. What might change, however, is the outcome of the process. The seeds might not grow as well (or at all) if they're exposed to harmful radiation from the unstable isotopes. Lastly, remember that the presence of unstable isotopes and their possible effects depend on various factors, including their concentration, the specific isotope type, the duration of exposure, etc. In situations where you might be dealing with radioactive isotopes, it's crucial to use proper safety procedures and seek expert guidance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a lover of themed cafes, I was excited to pay a visit to this whimsically named spot, full of promises of an enchanting dining experience. Unfortunately, the reality fell significantly short of my expectations, and I feel obliged to share my observations in this negative review. Upon entering the cafe, I couldn't help but notice the lackluster ambiance. For a place called The Enchanted Forest, I was hoping for an atmosphere full of magic and wonder. Instead, the decor consisted of a few poorly maintained potted plants and faded posters of forest scenes on the walls. The air was heavy with the scent of mustiness, and I couldn't shake the feeling that the furniture and fixtures hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. The service was also a major disappointment. Although we were one of the few tables occupied that day, it took a considerable amount of time for the waitress to acknowledge our presence. When we finally received menus, we were taken aback by the limited range of dishes available. A themed cafe should have an interesting, unique menu, but The Enchanted Forest Cafe's offerings were limited to ordinary sandwiches, salads, and a small selection of entrees that seemed out of place in the mystical realm I had been expecting. When our food arrived, it was less than satisfactory. The presentation was lackluster, and the taste was bland at best. To be honest, it seemed as if the chef had given little thought to creating vibrant flavors or presenting the dishes in a way that would have captured the essence of an enchanted dining experience. Moreover, our meals were served cold, and we had to ask multiple times for condiments before they were finally brought to the table. The prices were also exorbitant, especially for the quality of the food. I paid a hefty sum for a subpar sandwich and lukewarm soup, which left me feeling like I'd been cheated. Instead of walking away with fond memories and a full stomach, I was filled with regret over spending my money on a meal that did not live up to the promised enchantment. On a positive note, the only enchanted aspect was a live performance in one corner of the cafe. The musicians played enchanting melodies, providing a glimmer of the magic we were looking for. Yet, the background music did little to make up for the overall disappointing experience. In conclusion, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend The Enchanted Forest Cafe. While the idea of an enchanting themed dining experience is appealing, the execution is painfully lacking in virtually every regard. From the disappointing decor and atmosphere to the subpar food and service, there is little to celebrate about this establishment.

CHAPTER X BACK AT SCARCOMBE The news of their destination had created great satisfaction among the crew, as there was little honour or prize-money to be gained, and the vessel had been for some time incessantly engaged in hunting for foes that were never found. Not the least pleased was Will. He had left England a friendless ship’s-boy; he returned home a midshipman, with a most creditable record, and with a fortune that, when he left the service, would enable him to live in more than comfort. On arriving at Portsmouth the crew were at once paid off, and Will was appointed to the _Tartar_, a thirty-four gun frigate. On hearing the name of the ship, Dimchurch and Tom Stevens at once volunteered. They were given a fortnight’s leave; so Will, with Tom Stevens, determined to take a run up to Scarcombe, and the same day took coach to London. Dimchurch said he should spend his time in Portsmouth, as there was no one up in the north he cared to see, especially as it would take eight days out of his fortnight’s leave to go to his native place and back. On the fourth day after leaving London the two travellers reached Scarborough. Tom Stevens started at once, with his kit on a stick, to walk to the village, while Will made enquiries for the house of Mrs. Archer, which was Miss Warden’s married name. Without much trouble he made his way to it; and when the servant answered his knock he said: “I wish to see Mrs. Archer.” Answer the following questions: 1. Was the crew happy about the news they received? 2. Why? 3. Where was the ship headed? 4. Did they have to leave again immediately? 5. How much time did they have there? 6.

Kool-Aid is typically mixed with clean, fresh water which is free from high salt content or any other impurities that could alter its taste. Now, considering the answer options according to these criteria: A. Faucet water: Many households use faucet water for drinking and food preparation. It's generally treated and safe to consume, making it suitable for mixing Kool-Aid. B. Well water: While well water might have some impurities depending on the source, many rural areas rely on it for drinking and food preparation.

It may not come close to Agatha Christie or even Thin Man mysteries as a film noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical \\"boy meets girl\\" or \\"let's put on a show\\" backstage musical.

Sure, but the search is fun, even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief (luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls, Toby Wing).

What did the U.S. buy from Russia for 2 cents an acre? What is the answer?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question The question asks what the U.S. bought from Russia for 2 cents an acre. Step 2: Recall relevant historical events The United States purchased land from Russia in 1867. This transaction is known as the Alaska Purchase or Seward's Folly, after the US Secretary of State William H. Seward who negotiated the deal. Step 3: Identify the price and calculate the cost per acre The Alaska Purchase involved the United States paying Russia 7.2 million for approximately 586,412 square miles of land. Step 4: Calculate the price per acre We want to find out if the cost was indeed 2 cents per acre. First, let's convert the total price to cents by multiplying it by 100: 7,200,000 * 100 = 720,000,000 cents. Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of acres: 720,000,000 cents / 586,412 square miles. Step 5: Convert square miles to acres 1 square mile is equal to 640 acres. So, 586,412 square miles * 640 acres = 375,302,080 acres. Step 6: Calculate the final price per acre Now we can determine the price per acre: 720,000,000 cents / 375,302,080 acres ≈ 1.92 cents per acre. Step 7: Answer the question The U.S. bought Alaska from Russia for approximately 1.92 cents per acre, which is close to the 2 cents mentioned in the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This piece exemplifies the musical genre known as ragtime, which emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. Ragtime was a precursor to jazz, and it played a crucial role in shaping the development of American popular music. Ragtime is characterized by its syncopated, or \\"ragged,\\" rhythms, created by playing against the regular metrical accents of a piece. The genre originated from African-American roots, particularly in the musical traditions of African-Americans in the South. It evolved over time with influences from European classical music, particularly the march form popularized by composers like John Philip Sousa. This blend of African syncopation and European classical forms birthed a unique and innovative musical style. One of the defining features of ragtime is its signature syncopated rhythm typically played on a piano. The pianist's left hand usually plays a rhythmically steady bass line with chords or a march-like rhythm, while the right hand focuses on the syncopated, or off-beat, melodic line. This integration of melodic syncopation against a steady rhythm creates a rhythmic tension, or \\"swing,\\" which is characteristic of ragtime music. Scott Joplin is widely regarded as the \\"King of Ragtime,\\" and his compositions, including \\"The Entertainer,\\" \\"Maple Leaf Rag,\\" and \\"The Easy Winners\\" are still celebrated today as benchmarks within the genre. \\"The Entertainer\\" is a perfect example of Joplin's compositional prowess; it features a catchy and memorable melody with intricate patterns of syncopation against a steady bass line – all hallmarks of ragtime music. While the ragtime genre was initially popularized through sheet music sold for piano players, it soon expanded to include other instrumental ensembles, most notably brass bands and small orchestras. During its peak around the 1910s, ragtime was featured in dance halls, saloons, and even early silent films as an accompaniment. Although ragtime's popularity began to decline in the 1920s with the emergence of jazz music and other forms of popular entertainment, it experienced a resurgence in the 1970s following the release of the 1973 film \\"The Sting.\\" The movie's soundtrack, which prominently featured Joplin's \\"The Entertainer\\" and \\"Solace,\\" rekindled interest in the ragtime genre, leading to a revival of both Joplin's music and the ragtime style in general. In conclusion, \\"The Entertainer\\" by Scott Joplin exemplifies the ragtime genre, characterized by its syncopated rhythms, piano-centered compositions, and blending of African roots with European classical influences. Ragtime laid the groundwork for the development of jazz and is still recognized today as a foundational element of American popular music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pioneer of party-plan marketing, Earl Tupper invented what during his stay at DuPont????","completion":"Earl Tupper, a chemist and inventor, revolutionized the world of food storage and home products when he invented Tupperware during his stay at DuPont in the 1940s. Earl Tupper was born in 1907 in Berlin, New Hampshire. After working various jobs in the early 1930s, he joined the plastics division of DuPont in 1936, where he became interested in polyethylene, a newly discovered plastic material that he believed could be used to create a wide range of household products. Polyethylene was flexible, durable, and resistant to the effects of moisture, making it an ideal material for his purposes. During World War II, DuPont shifted its focus to supporting the war effort; however, Tupper continued his experiments with plastics. In 1942, he founded the Tupper Plastics Company to produce and sell his plastic products. Although he created many items, his real ingenuity was applied in designing the containers we now know as Tupperware. Tupperware containers were unique and innovative. They featured airtight seals, which hadn't been used before in consumer food storage products. The 'burping seal' was a pioneering design that allowed air to escape from the container, ensuring that the contents stayed fresh by preventing oxygen from entering. Earl Tupper's invention quickly became popular due to its effectiveness in preserving food freshness and preventing spills. It was during this time that he also created the party-plan marketing model, which played a crucial role in the success of Tupperware. Party-plan marketing was a direct sales approach that relied on hosting parties in people's homes to sell products. Tupper partnered with Brownie Wise, a successful saleswoman, in the late 1940s. Wise came up with the idea of Tupperware parties, where the host would invite friends and neighbors for a demonstration of the product. Guests could try out different containers, order customized ones, and even host their own parties. This innovative marketing method turned Tupperware into a household name and led to its sales soaring. It also gave rise to an entire industry based on the party-plan marketing model, which allowed people, especially women, to earn income and build their own businesses from home. Earl Tupper's contribution to society was twofold - his invention of the revolutionary Tupperware products and his adoption of the party-plan marketing strategy that made the brand so popular. His ingenuity transformed food storage and contributed to the empowerment of women, who became the backbone of Tupperware sales and established successful careers through this innovative means of entrepreneurship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, we had to wait for more than 40 minutes to get a table, even though we had a reservation. Once seated, it took another 30 minutes for our order to be taken. The food, on the other hand, was underwhelming. My wife's pasta dish tasted bland, and it seemed as if the sauce was store-bought rather than homemade. My steak was overcooked, even though I specifically requested it to be medium-rare. The presentation was lackluster as well, with barely any garnishes or effort put into making the dishes visually appealing. Moreover, the service was equally unsatisfactory.

The citrusy flavor left a sour note on her tongue that she preferred to avoid. Instead, she sought the comfort of a warm, sweet cup of tea that could soothe her nerves and provide a much-needed moment of relaxation. When she added the honey, the thick, golden liquid seemed to melt seamlessly into the steaming liquid, dissolving softly and imparting its rich, unique sweetness into the tea. As she stirred the tea gently, she watched the honey create swirling patterns in the dark amber liquid, like a dance between two familiar elements. The delightful scent of her tea wafted up to her nose, inviting her to take her first sip.

Over time, she had perfected her tea preparation routine, recognizing that honey was not only a preferred taste but also carried significant health benefits. The antioxidant properties, natural enzymes, and minerals present in honey made it an ideal addition to her daily cup of tea, providing immune-boosting benefits and contributions to her overall wellness – without the lemon's sharp tanginess. She found that the honey-enriched tea soothed her throat during cold months, while its antibacterial properties kept minor infections at bay. As she sat in her favorite armchair, cradling her steaming cup of honey-infused tea between her hands, she closed her eyes and let her thoughts drift away. Soaking in the peaceful ambiance, accompanied only by the steady rhythm of raindrops on the window, she realized that, with each sip of her tea, the weight of the day's worries seemed to dissipate. It was in these quiet moments of reflection, savoring the soothing taste of honey in her drink devoid of lemon's sourness, that she found the strength to face the next day's challenges with renewed energy and determination. In the end, leaving the lemon out of her tea and opting for generous dollops of honey created a beverage perfectly tailored to her taste and well-being. She had discovered a unique, personal ritual that not only provided her with moments of calm, but it also infused her life with a thread of sweetness and warmth – like the embrace of a dear friend who had witnessed her trials and triumphs, and would be there for her whenever she needed solace and comfort.

Q: What are are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter? Choices: - bottom feeders - difference feeders - waste feeders - deposit feeders A: The answer is:","completion":"Deposit feeders. Deposit feeders are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter, typically found in the top layer of soil or sediment. These feeders play a vital role in the recycling of nutrients within their respective ecosystems, as they consume and break down organic debris into smaller particles. This in turn makes the nutrients more available to other organisms, promoting overall ecosystem health and stability. As mentioned in the given paragraph, sea cucumbers are an example of deposit feeders in marine environments. Living on the ocean floor, they consume tiny bits of organic matter, or detritus, which are abundant in their habitats. This feeding method not only provides nourishment for the sea cucumbers but also supports an array of other organisms that share their habitat. Simultaneously, deposit feeders help to maintain the balance of nutrients within their environments by breaking down organic matter and facilitating its cycling through the ecosystem. In comparison, the other options provided do not accurately describe organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter: - Bottom feeders: This term refers to aquatic animals or fish that feed on or near the bottom of a body of water. While some deposit feeders may be classified as bottom feeders, the term bottom feeder is more general and does not specifically identify organisms feeding exclusively on small organic particles. - Difference feeders: This is not a recognized term for any specific type of feeding behavior or group of organisms in the field of ecology or biology. - Waste feeders: While some deposit feeders may consume waste materials, this term is not specific enough to describe all deposit feeders. Waste feeders can refer to a broader range of organisms that feed on the waste of other organisms, but this does not exclusively involve feeding on small organic particles. In conclusion, deposit feeders are the organisms that specifically feed on small pieces of organic matter, playing a significant role in nutrient recycling and ecosystem health. Sea cucumbers are a prime example of deposit feeders in marine ecosystems, contributing to the overall functioning and balance of their environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is Saudi arabia?\\" Context: \\"According to Johnson and Grim (2013), Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910, of which 137 million were in Asia, to 495 million in 2010, of which 487 million are in Asia. According to them, there was a fast annual growth of Buddhism in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and several Western European countries (1910–2010). More recently (2000–2010), the countries with highest growth rates are Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and some African countries.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is a sovereign country located in the Middle East and occupies the majority of the Arabian Peninsula. As the largest country in the Middle East, it is bordered by Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen, as well as the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Although the context you provided discusses the growth of Buddhism in various countries, including some Middle Eastern nations such as Lebanon and Saudi Arabia from 1910 to 2010, it is vital to clarify that Saudi Arabia is predominantly an Islamic country. The nation is known for its significance to Islam, as it is home to the religion's two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, where millions of Muslims from around the world visit annually to perform Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. The establishment of the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia dates back to 1932 when Abdulaziz Al Saud unified the kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd. It has since evolved into the center of power in the region. Due to its vast oil reserves, Saudi Arabia is considered an economic powerhouse and a major player in global energy markets. The country is one of the founding members of the OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and has the second-largest proven oil reserves globally. Although Saudi Arabia is primarily an Islamic country, the context implies that there has been a noticeable growth in Buddhism from 1910 to 2010. Indeed, other religious groups, including Buddhists, are present in the nation primarily due to its vast expatriate workforce drawn from various countries for employment opportunities. However, these non-Muslim religious practices are typically restricted to private spaces, as Saudi Arabia's legal system adheres to a strict interpretation of Sunni Islamic law, leaving no room for other forms of public religious expression. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has undergone several economic and social reforms under its ambitious Vision 2030 plan, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This plan seeks to diversify the country's economy away from oil dependency and make significant strides in areas like education, infrastructure, and tourism. These changes may gradually lead to increased multiculturalism and a more open environment for people of different faiths, including Buddhists, to practice their religion, albeit discreetly and privately. In conclusion, Saudi Arabia is a powerful and influential Islamic nation situated in the Middle East, with a strong connection to Islamic culture and history. The context provided regarding the growth of Buddhism in Saudi Arabia and other countries during the 20th and 21st centuries suggests that the presence of diverse religious groups has expanded, predominantly owing to expatriate workers.

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was mamas mink jacket?\\" is \\"A friend hand-me-down\\"?","completion":"No, sweetie, that's not correct. Mama's mink jacket was described as a \\"family hand-me-down\\" in the story. That means it was given to her by someone in her family who used it before. It is like when your older brother or sister gives you toys they no longer play with. Those toys are hand-me-downs because they were handed down to you. So, we can say that Mama's mink jacket was an old jacket passed down from someone else in her family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Now, I have a new situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Answer this question please: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force?","completion":"The group whose cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force is Group George. The kinetic-molecular theory you described provides an explanation for this scenario. The heat from the campfire added kinetic energy to the air molecules inside the soup cans. As a result, these air molecules began moving faster, colliding with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. In the case of Group Jones, they did not vent the cans before heating them. This meant that the interior of the can became a closed system, with no opportunity for the increasing pressure to escape. As the can heated, the air molecules inside moved faster due to an increase in thermal energy from the fire, which led to more frequent and stronger collisions with the can walls. This escalation in pressure ultimately exceeded the physical limit of the can, causing it to explode. On the other hand, Group George vented their cans before heating them. This provided an outlet for the pressure to escape as the air inside the can heated up and expanded. The movement of the air molecules and their impact against the can wall would still increase due to the heat, but the force of these impacts would be significantly reduced because the excess pressure could escape through the vent hole. This venting action effectively prevented a dangerous build-up of pressure inside the can, allowing Group George to safely heat their cans of soup over the campfire. As a result, the air molecules inside the cans of Group George would have impacted the container walls with considerably less force than those in the unvented cans of Group Jones. Therefore, Group George's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force."},{"prompt":"Q:Where do investment bankers hang out in the suburbs? - wall street - city hall - monopoly game - michigan - country club The best answer is A:","completion":"country club"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... Question: what are the factors that make one a refugee === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The factors that make one a refugee are primarily based on the definition provided by the 1951 United Nation's Refugee Convention. According to this definition, a refugee is someone who: 1. Has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. This means that the person has a genuine and significant reason to believe that they will be targeted and harmed due to their identity or beliefs. 2. Is outside the country of their nationality. To be considered a refugee, a person must have fled their home country and crossed an international border. Individuals who are displaced within their own country are referred to as internally displaced persons (IDPs), and while they may face similar challenges, they are not considered refugees under international law. 3. Is unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their own country. This indicates that the person cannot safely return to their home country, either because the government is unable or unwilling to protect them from harm, or because the individual fears retaliation upon their return. It is important to note that these factors are considered in the context of specific circumstances in a given country or region. The factors that make someone a refugee may vary depending on the nature of the conflict or persecution taking place. For example, refugees fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, Iraq, or Libya primarily face violence, civil unrest, and political instability, whereas refugees from other countries might be escaping targeted persecution by their governments or other groups due to their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason prefers eating tangerines over oranges, because the Pick from: --tangerines are smaller and easier to eat.; --oranges are smaller and easier to eat.;","completion":"tangerines are smaller and easier to eat. In comparison to oranges, tangerines have thinner skin that makes them faster and more convenient to peel. Their small segments are easier to separate and enjoy one by one, making them an on-the-go snack that doesn't require much effort. In Jason's busy life, having a food item that is simpler to handle is particularly appealing. Furthermore, Jason enjoys the unique flavor profile of tangerines. Tangerines have a sweeter and less acidic taste compared to oranges, which is highly appreciated by many, including Jason. That is because tangerines have a higher concentration of natural sugars, while still providing the vit-C kick and a boost to the immune system, making them a healthy and tasty choice. Another reason why Jason prefers tangerines over oranges is their portability. Tangerines are known for their small size, which means they can easily fit into lunchboxes, purses, or even pockets. Their distinct shape and easy-to-handle nature make them a go-to snack not only for Jason but also for many people who are looking for a quick, healthy bite. In addition, tangerines are often found to have a thinner pith than oranges. Pith is the white, spongy layer between the fruit's skin and the flesh, and it is often bitter in taste. Since tangerines have a thinner pith, there is less of it to remove, ultimately easing the overall process of enjoying their succulent taste. This contributes to Jason's preference for tangerines, as it further emphasizes the convenience factor. An added bonus to choosing tangerines over oranges is that they are usually seedless or have very few seeds. This difference makes a huge impact on the overall eating experience, ensuring a smooth and pleasant consumption. Not having to worry about seeds is particularly important to Jason, who enjoys focusing on the taste of the fruit and not having to deal with seeds getting in his way. In conclusion, Jason prefers tangerines over oranges due to their smaller size, thin skin, unique sweet flavor, portability, thin pith, and lower seed content. Overall, tangerines provide Jason with a convenient and enjoyable snacking experience that is unmatched by their larger counterpart, oranges. It is their ease of eating and distinctive taste that makes tangerines Jason's preferred choice of citrus fruit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged. Question: \\"What is the physical property that causes particles to attract or repel each other?\\" Answer: \\"Electrical charge causes particles to attract or repel each other\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. Based on the paragraph, electrical charge is indeed the physical property that causes particles or objects to attract or repel each other. It is due to the presence of positive and negative charges in the form of protons and electrons within atoms. When an object gains or loses electrons, it becomes either negatively or positively charged, respectively. These charged objects then experience attractive or repulsive forces between them, depending on the nature of their charges (opposite charges attract, while like charges repel). This phenomenon is fundamental to the understanding of electromagnetism and the behavior of charged particles in various systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Math Problem Solve -297*c - 54*c = 6669 for c.","completion":"Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. We have two terms with the variable c (-297c and -54c). We will combine these terms by adding them together. -297c + (-54c) = -297c - 54c Step 2: Add the coefficients of the c terms. The coefficients of the c terms are -297 and -54. Add these two values together: -297 + (-54) = -351 Now the equation looks like this: -351c = 6669 Step 3: Solve for the variable c. In order to solve for the variable c, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since we have -351c on the left side, we will divide both sides of the equation by -351 to isolate c. -351c / (-351) = 6669 / (-351) Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. When we divide both sides of the equation by -351, we get: c = -19 So the solution to the problem is c = -19."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who succeed in repairing an aircraft? from the following article ? The US Army is conducting a fighting retreat. A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up. There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time. The remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting heavy losses and ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed, leaving only Dane, Todd, and a wounded Purckett alive. Purckett is shot, while Todd stabbed through the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead. Before he dies, Todd admits to Dane he is Burns.

Write a text based on this summary: states green groups petition epa to regulate aircraft emissions Text:","completion":"Title: Environmental Groups Urge EPA to Regulate Aircraft Emissions A growing coalition of environmental organizations from various states has recently petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate emissions produced by aircraft. The groups have voiced their concerns over the significant impact these emissions have on both air quality and climate change. In response, they are urging the EPA to implement stricter controls on the aviation industry in order to protect public health and the environment. Aircraft emissions are known to contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gases, leading to detrimental effects on human health, wildlife, and the climate. Studies have shown that emissions generated by the aviation industry account for a significant portion of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. As air travel increases in popularity, the industry's emission levels continue to rise. Environmental advocates argue that existing regulations are insufficient and outdated, leaving a major gap in protecting the environment and public health from the effects of aircraft emissions. They believe that the EPA has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue and must act with urgency to establish tighter emission standards. The groups recognize the complexities of regulating an industry that operates across international boundaries and may involve varying levels of environmental standards. However, they believe that the EPA has the authority to not only establish but also enforce emission regulations on aircraft within the United States. In doing so, the measure is expected to encourage other nations to follow suit, leading to a global reduction in aircraft-related emissions. In their petition, the environmental groups also emphasize the need for the development and implementation of cleaner, more sustainable aviation technologies. They believe that by setting stricter emissions standards, the EPA can incentivize the aviation industry to invest in the research and development of innovative solutions that can contribute to greener and more efficient travel. This shift toward sustainable technologies would align with the overall objective of reducing global CO2 emissions and mitigating climate change. As the petition awaits further consideration and action from the EPA, the environmental groups behind the initiative remain hopeful that their efforts will pave the way for meaningful change in the aviation industry. By regulating aircraft emissions, the EPA could help to protect public health and the environment, while simultaneously encouraging industry-wide innovation in sustainable aviation practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Consider putting together a basic routine to boost your fitness level. Whether or not you have access to a gym, start with the basics at home: push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and, if you have access to weights, basic squats, curls, and bench presses. If you’re not sure of where to begin—what exercises to include in your routine, what weights to lift, etc.—talk to your gym coach or check online for teen weight-training recommendations. Before each workout, start with about 10 minutes of mild stretches. Warming up helps prevent injury and can help to maximize the calories burnt during your entire workout. Similarly, if you take the time to taper off your workout with cooling-down stretches you will feel less taxed when you are done. Over time, if you find that you enjoy running, think about joining a cross country team. Find a friend who also wants to be active during the week and exercise with them. You can also ask members of your family (siblings, cousins, even parents) if they’d like to exercise with you. It’ll be easier to stay motivated to be fit if you have a friend or family member to exercise with and who can provide moral support. Having a friend to support you will make you more likely to stick with your exercise regime.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: 11 Diagonal Street, location, South Africa; South Africa, leader, Cyril Ramaphosa; South Africa, ethnicGroup, Asian South Africans. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided consists of diverse information about South Africa, specifically pertaining to a location, the leader, and an ethnic group found within the country. 1. Location: 11 Diagonal Street, South Africa 11 Diagonal Street is a noteworthy location situated in Johannesburg, one of the most iconic cities in South Africa. Johannesburg serves as the economic heart of the country and has grown exponentially since the late 19th century, following the discovery of vast gold reserves. It is considered the largest city in South Africa, and its unique architecture reflects a rich blend of historical and contemporary influences. 11 Diagonal Street refers to a distinctive building within the city limits, designed by renowned architect Helmut Jahn in a structural expressionist style. Completed in 1984, this 80-meter high office building stands like a set of stacked cubes slightly twisted on their axis. The design allows the edifice to respond optimally to its unique location opposite the South African Reserve Bank, with reflective glass surfaces mirroring nearby buildings and urban scenes. As such, it has become a visual representation of Johannesburg's financial district and has contributed greatly to the city's iconic skyline. 2. Leader: Cyril Ramaphosa Cyril Ramaphosa is a distinguished political figure who serves as the fifth and current President of South Africa since February 2018. Born on November 17, 1952, in Soweto, Ramaphosa has a background in law, having studied at the University of South Africa before gaining prominence in both the trade union movement and the African National Congress (ANC) party. As South Africa strived for equality during the apartheid era, Ramaphosa emerged as a key negotiator in the country's transition to democracy in the early 1990s. Following the historic election of Nelson Mandela in 1994, Ramaphosa occupied various political roles such as Member of Parliament and even chaired the Constitutional Assembly responsible for drafting South Africa's current Constitution. In recent years, Ramaphosa has focused on addressing South Africa's most pressing issues, including economic reform, reducing inequality, and tackling corruption within the political sphere. His leadership is pivotal in steering the nation toward a more transparent and democratic governance that uplifts all citizens equitably. 3. Ethnic Group: Asian South Africans Asian South Africans represent a significant ethnic group within the diverse population of South Africa. Primarily hailing from South Asia (comprising countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and South-East Asia (comprising countries like China, Vietnam, and Malaysia), these communities have established deep roots within the nation across several generations. The history of Asian South Africans can be traced back to the late 19th century when indentured laborers from India were brought to work on sugar plantations in the area known today as KwaZulu-Natal. Over time, various waves of migration from other Asian countries have contributed to the diverse and vibrant melting pot that constitutes contemporary South African society. Although discrimination existed during the apartheid era, particularly against Indian South Africans with the introduction of the Group Areas Act, the post-apartheid period has seen efforts to rectify these historical injustices and embrace the nation's diversity. Today, Asian South Africans play pivotal roles across all spheres of society, including politics, business, and the arts. Their rich cultural heritage contributes significantly to South Africa's unique tapestry of ethnic identities and shared history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Michael Jordan’s Bulls set an NBA record with 72 wins, but they were this close to 75 In May 1995, Michael Jordan had already stopped wearing No. 45. The front and back of his Chicago Bulls jersey was adorned with the 2 and the 3 — again. It was a reminder of the Michael Jordan of old — the Jordan the world knew before his baseball stint south of the Mason-Dixon line where his batting average hovered just above the Mendoza line. But even with his old number on his chest, Jordan’s team wasn’t having the success for which that 23 was known. The Bulls fell to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, Jordan’s first loss in a Game 7 since 1990. “It’s very disappointing,” Jordan said after the defeat. “I’ve got a whole summer to say what if. What if I made the jump shots down the stretch? What if I’d been here a whole season? What if I’d been here last season?” The following year, the what-ifs had subsided. The Bulls set fire to the league during the 1995-96 season, winning an NBA-record 72 games en route to the first of three more titles. But they were closer than you think to have an even better record. With the Golden State Warriors now threatening to break that 72-win record this season (through 62 games, they have 56 wins; the Bulls had 55), we’re taking a look back at how the 1995-96 Bulls could have really gone 75-7, if not for just a few bad breaks. [Lakers shock Warriors for biggest regular season upset in NBA history] For starters, Jordan’s Bulls lost three times over the final 21 games of the season. Each of those losses was by a margin of just one point. Even more surprising: Those were the Bulls’ only three games of the regular season decided by a one-point margin. And at least two of those games involved a player with a direct tie to the present-day Warriors, who may surpass the Bulls’ record. By the time March rolled around, Toronto had already lost to the Bulls three times in its bumpy inaugural NBA season. First, there was a pair of nine-point defeats. Then came a three-point loss in Chicago in January. Two months later, north of the border, the Raptors got their revenge. With 24 seconds remaining, Jordan missed a driving layup that was rebounded by Toronto’s Oliver Miller, who then promptly called a timeout. One problem: The Raptors didn’t have any timeouts remaining. As fate would have it, the Raptors were bailed out as Jordan was called for a foul prior to the timeout signal. Miller then made the first free throw and missed the second; Scottie Pippen rebounded and called a timeout. Leading to the final play… So yeah, maybe Steve Kerr (who now coaches the Warriors now) was planning for the future with this miss? But imagine the shot and Jordan’s subsequent rebound had come just a few tenths of second earlier. Jordan’s final bucket would have counted and the Bulls would have win No. 73. A cruel twist from the clock. The Bulls’ mastery at United Center had spanned 44 games (an NBA record for consecutive home wins until the mark was surpassed by the Warriors on Monday night), with Chicago’s last home loss on March 24, 1995 to the same team that would oust them from the postseason two months later — the Magic. Then the Hornets came to town. Charlotte star Larry Johnson played just 23 minutes with a nagging hand injury and scored just eight points. Off the bench came — who else? — Dell Curry. Yes, that Dell Curry. The father of Stephen Curry, who had just turned 8 years old March 24. And on this night, the elder Curry was the hero for the Hornets He scored 19 points and hit the final two free throws to give Charlotte the 98-97 lead prior to the Bulls’ final possession. In case you are keeping count, that is two straight Bulls defeats, by one point, in the final seconds, involving the Warriors’ current coach and the father of the best basketball player on the planet right now — who plays for the Warriors. Eerie. Nearly two years before this game, NBA referee Hue Hollins made probably the most memorable questionable call in the history of the Bulls franchise. And 23 months later, with .05 seconds remaining vs. the Pacers, Hollins called No. 23 for maybe the second most memorable questionable call. However, it might not have mattered the second time had Jordan made this jumper with seven seconds remaining. The Pacers pushed the ball up court to Eddie Johnson. He had made one bucket in 12 minutes prior to his final attempt. The foul sent Johnson to the line, who made just one of two free throws for the win. And in case you’re wondering, no, Johnson didn’t every play for or coach the Warriors. He was actually born in Chicago. So much for our Warriors connections. Back to 2016: If Golden State is perfect in its final 21 games, its 76 wins would top even this hypothetical win total by the Bulls. So “what if” wouldn’t even matter. But perhaps the biggest “what if” to take away from all of this: What if Pippen hadn’t shot 12-of-35 combined (28 total points) in those three Bulls defeats? Then there wouldn’t be a need for those two, nagging words. Dan is the sports design editor at The Washington Post.

The second game in the series is credited with establishing many of the conventions of the one-on-one fighting genre. The game's playable characters originate from different countries around the world, each with a unique fighting style. It is Capcom's second best-selling franchise, having had significant success worldwide. The first game in the series was released in 1987. - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - The , stylized as NINTENDO and often referred to as N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is the industry's last major successive home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, as all succeeding home consoles up until the Nintendo Switch used an optical format. In addition, current handheld systems (such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - Body Blows is an Amiga versus fighting game. It was released in 1993 by Team17. The game is compatible with all Amiga systems, including the CDTV system with joystick support. It was followed by \\"Body Blows Galactic\\" and \\"Ultimate Body Blows\\". A version for DOS was also released. The game has a lot of similarities to \\"Street Fighter II\\", for example, both had two characters with projectile, rising uppercut and spinning kick special moves and played identically (as with Ryu and Ken). - Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) is a fighting video game developed by Midway Games and first released into arcades in 1995 as the third game in the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" series. As in the previous games, it has a cast of characters that players choose from and guide through a series of battles against other opponents. The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors, as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn, who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm. - Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a fighting video game released by Midway in 1996 as an update to \\"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3\\". Unlike the previous title, it was not released in arcades (except for prototypes), but was instead released for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn and PCs. Further versions were also released for the Game.com and R-Zone. - Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (\\"UMK3\\") is a fighting video game in the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" series, originally developed and released by Midway Games to arcades in 1995.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - The is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe as the successor to the successful Sega Genesis. The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original titles. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - Body Blows Galactic is a fighting game developed and published by Team17 in for the Amiga computers. It is a sequel to 1992's \\"Body Blows\\". Opponents and background graphics from both games were later merged into the compilation release \\"Ultimate Body Blows\\". - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer and Maria both had unprotected sex with the same man. This man, unbeknownst to them, has hepatitis b. Both women go to the doctor to get checked out. Jennifer reports that she is coughing frequently and has a congested nose. The doctor notices that Maria has yellow eyes and she tells the doctor that she has been throwing up. But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B. What is an answer for this question: Who will probably not be prescribed medicine for their liver? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Jennifer will probably not be prescribed medicine for her liver. This is because her symptoms, such as coughing frequently and having a congested nose, do not align with the typical symptoms of Hepatitis B, which include vomiting and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Maria, on the other hand, exhibits symptoms consistent with Hepatitis B, such as yellow eyes and vomiting. Therefore, it is likely that the doctor would consider prescribing medicine for Maria's liver to help prevent liver damage.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the current is unusually strong because of rip tides happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Acid rain is a byproduct of human activity and natural sources involving the emission of gases containing sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These gases, when released into the atmosphere, react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which then fall to the ground in rain or snow. The process of acid rain has several negative impacts on the environment, including damage to rocks, soil, vegetation, and aquatic life. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an unusual event such as strong rip currents caused by fluctuating weather patterns could potentially lead to an increase in the harmful effects of acid rain. Rip currents are strong, narrow channels of water that move quickly away from the shore, typically through the surf zone. They are caused by the interaction of waves with the shape of the seabed and coastline. In this case, the perturbation hypothesis posits that the unusual strength of rip currents could indirectly impact the effects of acid rain on the environment. There are several ways that unusually strong rip currents could influence the effects of acid rain, including: 1. Redistribution of polluted water: Strong rip currents could potentially distribute acidic water over a larger area by dragging polluted waters from one location to another. This may increase the overall impact of acid rain on a broader ecosystem, potentially affecting plants and animals that were previously unaffected by the acidic conditions. 2. Soil erosion: Rip currents can cause significant erosion of the shorelines, particularly in areas with looser soil or sand. In turn, this alters the surrounding environment, potentially exacerbating the effects of acid rain. Soil erosion can lead to a loss of vegetation, which may further affect local wildlife and ecosystems. 3. Sediment disruption: Alongside soil erosion, strong rip currents can cause sediment to be churned up from the sea floor and introduced into the water column. This can have a disruptive effect on local aquatic ecosystems, as the added sediment can block sunlight from reaching underwater plants and disrupt the feeding habits of filter-feeding animals. In combination with acid rain, this disruption to the aquatic ecosystem could heighten the overall damage to the environment. 4. Interference with natural buffering and dissipation processes: Natural processes (both physical and biological) can help to neutralize and dissipate the acidity of rainwater, reducing its impact on the environment. The presence of strong rip currents could interfere with these processes, potentially leading to an increased persistence of acidic conditions in the affected area. In conclusion, while rip currents themselves do not directly contribute to acid rain production or increase its acidity, their influence on the environment can indirectly exacerbate the effects of acid rain. The unusual strength of rip currents may lead to a redistribution of polluted water, soil erosion, sediment disruption, and interference with natural buffering and dissipation processes, all of which may contribute to heightened environmental damage. As such, it is essential to monitor and mitigate the impacts of both acid rain and other environmental perturbations to protect the health and stability of our ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. Answer:","completion":"The majority group in Sao Paulo province was White Brazilians, which included descendants of the original Portuguese settlers and other European immigrants such as Italians, Spaniards, and Germans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This ultimately affects businesses and the economy as a whole, as legislative measures often include provisions for financing projects, approving expenditures, and granting tax breaks or incentives.

Watchdog claims it needs to access records to monitor 'clinical quality' Experts describe it as 'fishing exercise' undermining patient confidentiality. CQC claims it has snooping powers under Health and Social Care Act 2008. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Privacy Concerns Rise as Health Inspectors Access Medical Records during Surgery Checks In a move that has raised alarm among privacy advocates and the medical community, health inspectors conducting surgery checks have begun to access patient medical records. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), the watchdog that oversees these inspections, claims this access is necessary to ensure the highest standard of clinical quality. Some experts, however, see this as a breach of patient confidentiality that may discourage patients from openly sharing sensitive health information with their healthcare providers. The CQC maintains that its inspectors require access to medical records and other pertinent patient information in order to properly evaluate surgery procedures and outcomes. This information, they argue, is crucial in determining whether a healthcare provider is fully meeting regulatory standards, as outlined by the Health and Social Care Act 2008. CQC officials state that this unprecedented level of access allows them to effectively safeguard patients and ensure the best possible quality of care. Nonetheless, critics argue that this so-called \\"snooping\\" goes beyond the boundaries of acceptable oversight and undermines the fundamental principle of patient confidentiality. To them, the CQC's decision to access medical records seems like a \\"fishing exercise\\" that could possibly reveal sensitive patient details, which may not have any bearing on the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals. Concerns over patient privacy have been exacerbated as several experts have pointed out that the CQC has provided vague guidance on how inspectors will preserve confidentiality while accessing patient records. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the potentially inappropriate handling of sensitive information, which could lead to breaches of patient privacy. Aside from the obvious privacy concerns, there are concerns that this practice could have negative consequences on the doctor-patient relationship. By accessing records without patient consent, CQC inspectors are potentially eroding the trust that exists between healthcare professionals and their patients. This could deter patients from being forthcoming about their medical history or mental health issues, fearing that their information may be accessed without their knowledge or consent. Some medical professionals fear that undermining patient confidentiality may lead to a decline in the number of patients who willingly disclose sensitive health information, persuading them to forego necessary care out of distrust. This, in turn, can lead to poorer health outcomes and a strain on medical resources, as conditions that could have been resolved early may worsen and require more extensive interventions. In light of these concerns, many are calling on the CQC to reassess its approach and consider adopting alternative measures that prioritize patient privacy and respect the doctor-patient relationship. This could involve seeking explicit patient consent before accessing medical records or implementing additional safeguards to protect patient confidentiality during inspections. The controversy surrounding the CQC's medical record access highlights the tension between safeguarding patient data and ensuring exceptional clinical quality. As the debate continues, it is essential that regulatory bodies, healthcare providers, and privacy advocates work together to develop a balanced approach that prioritizes both patient privacy and effective oversight. Ultimately, fostering a transparent, trusting, and safe healthcare environment is crucial to ensuring optimal patient care and outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: I do see the sense in some measures such as restricting access to guns for people who have committed violent crimes. Sentence 2: And as far as carrying in public, as long as I have committed no crime, then why should anyone need know I have my gun. Analysis and Translation: Sentence 1 talks about restricting access to guns for people with a history of violent crimes. Sentence 2 discusses carrying guns in public when the person has not committed any crime. Conclusion: The two sentences talk about different aspects of gun control. Sentence 1 focuses on restricting access to guns for a specific group with a history of violence, while Sentence 2 emphasizes the right to carry guns in public for law-abiding citizens. Therefore, these two sentences do not share the same facet. Output: NOT SIMILAR"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The senate's ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators. This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consulta. These were officially \\"advice\\" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates. The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC, this practice became less prevalent, as the Roman Dictator, Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members. What governing Roman body would self-select their own members during times of great distress?","completion":"During times of great distress or military emergency, the Roman Senate would self-select their own members.

Q: The spike (S) protein of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) mediates both cell attachment by binding to its receptor hACE2 and membrane fusion during virus entry. We have previously identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and residues important for RBD-hACE2 association. Here, we further characterized the S protein by investigating the roles of the cytoplasmic tail and 19 residues located in the RBD in protein accumulation, receptor binding, and pseudotype virus entry. For these purposes, we first identified an entry-efficient S gene template from a pool of gene variants and used it as a backbone to generate a series of cytoplasmic tail deletion and single residue substitution mutants. Our results showed that: (i) deletion of 18 aa from the C-terminus enhanced the S protein accumulation and virus entry, which might be due to the deletion of intracellular retention signals; (ii) further deletion to residue 29 also enhanced the amount of S protein on the cell surface and in virion, but reduced virus entry by 25%, suggesting that residues 19-29 contributes to membrane fusion; (iii) a 29 aa-deletion mutant had a defect in anchoring on the plasma membrane, which led to a dramatic decrease of S protein in virion and virus entry; (iv) a total of 15 residues (Y498, V499, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, G575, S576, E582, W585, Y590, T591, V593 and G594) within RBD were important for receptor binding and virus entry.

(b). positive.","completion":"Based on the content and overall tone of the review provided, it is apparent that this review is (a) negative. The reviewer was highly critical, expressing intense dissatisfaction with nearly every aspect of the movie they watched. They criticized the plot, the pace, and the acting, going so far as to state that it's the \\"worst movie\\" they've ever seen. They also expressed that they perceived the movie as a waste of time and recommended others not to watch it. These are all indicative of a generally unfavorable or negative review. In the evidence provided, they state \\"this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life,\\" which suggests extreme dissatisfaction, and therefore negative sentiment. They also say \\"all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie,\\" implying a lack of professionalism or high-quality production, another negative point. Another negative aspect identified is the lack of structure and organization in the movie, as per the statement \\"there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming.\\" They expressed discontentment with the pace too, saying \\"i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie.\\" The story of the movie was also seen as an issue, the reviewer called it \\"so fake,\\" again showing negativity given that successful films generally require a believable or engaging narrative. Lastly, the strongest indication that this feedback is negative, is when the reviewer states \\"if you're considering watching this movie, don't. you're just wasting your time.\\" This discouragement not only reveals the reviewer's negative sentiment, but also tries to deter potential viewers from watching the movie, which is indicative of a negative review overall.

Shortly after George Jones' birth, Tina adopted Georgette, Tina, and her sisters. Tina is mentioned twice, which makes the sentence a bit confusing. It is possible that this is an error and that the first \\"Tina\\" in the sentence was unintentionally mentioned when it should have been someone else. 2. Sentence 2: \\"Georgette adopted Tina and her sisters shortly after the birth of their Daughter George Jones.\\" In this sentence, Georgette is the one who adopted Tina and her sisters. The daughter, George Jones, belongs to Tina and her sisters. This implies that George Jones is the daughter of Tina's family (most likely one of Tina's sisters).

Article:","completion":"Title: Crafting with Precision: Ribbon Projects Made Simple As the world whooshes forward, fueled by technological advancements, engaging in traditional activities like crafting can serve as a soothing moment of respite. Crafting with ribbons is one such activity that combines creativity and pleasure to harvest beautiful pieces as the end product. The first critical step to undertake before you plunge into your crafting escapade is gathering all your supplies. This implies that you need to secure high-quality crafting ribbon, which is easily available in craft stores or online. Depending on the particular project you have in mind, you may also require scissors, a ruler or tape measure, and a hot glue gun or fabric adhesive. The significance of collecting every required supply cannot be overstated, as these tools form the foundation of your crafting journey. Having everything at your fingertips helps to streamline your crafting process, eliminates unnecessary interruptions, and ultimately, enhances your crafting experience. Once your supplies are ready and within reach, it is time to move on to one of the most critical steps in crafting – measurement. It is crucial here to measure the ribbon carefully. Getting the dimensions right at this stage saves you from the odd possibility of having either a surplus or shortage of the ribbon further down the line. Measurement also ensures proportionality and symmetry in the final product, attributes that add to its aesthetic appeal. Utilize the ruler or the tape measure to help achieve accurate measurements. It is better to err on the side of excess while cutting, as you can always trim down an overly long piece, but cannot do much about a short one. The third vital step involves holding the loop. This stage is where your project starts taking form. Carefully create the loop in your ribbon, grasizing it securely but gently. It's an art form to find the perfect balance, ensuring the loop doesn't lose its shape or crinkle during handling. Manipulating the ribbon into your desired form requires delicate hands and a fair amount of patience. Remember to perform this action slowly and steadily for seamless execution. The art of crafting with ribbons can be an opportunity to express your personality, to relax, and to create something beautiful. In an era where virtually everything is mechanized, this art form stands as a testament to the value of handmade crafts. So capture your tools, measure your ribbon, maintain and hold your loop. It is through these systematic steps that your crafting journey begins, and the potential for creativity unfolds in your hands. The process may be elementary, but the satisfaction arising from it is genuinely magnificent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In Asia, various aspects of Buddhism often receive government support, especially in countries where it is recognized as the state religion or holds a significant cultural influence. Some of these supported aspects include: 1. Religious institutions: Buddhist temples, shrines, and monasteries may receive financial assistance, land grants, and other forms of support from the government to maintain their operations and preserve religious heritage sites. 2. Education: Governments may provide funding and support for Buddhist educational institutions, such as schools, colleges, and universities that focus on Buddhist studies and the teachings of the Buddha. This support helps preserve and promote Buddhist philosophy and knowledge. 3. Cultural preservation: Governments in Asia may invest in the preservation and restoration of Buddhist art, architecture, and archaeological sites. This aids in conserving the cultural heritage and history of Buddhism in the region. 4. Religious festivals and events: Governments may sponsor or support Buddhist festivals, events, and ceremonies, which help promote national unity and preserve the traditional aspects of the faith. 5. Social welfare: In some countries, Buddhist organizations receive government support for their charitable activities, such as providing food, shelter, and care to the needy. This support helps address various social issues and contributes to the overall well-being of the community. In summary, government support for Buddhism in Asia can manifest in various ways, including financial assistance, land grants, and support for institutions, education, cultural preservation, religious events, and social welfare.

Can the creator of Harry Potter do the same for a grown-up audience? The British author will find out on September 27, when more than 2 million hardcover copies of her first novel for adults hit bookstores in the UK and the US, along with the digital edition. Set in a little English town, The Casual Vacancy is about an election held after an unexpected death. Michael Pietsch, Rowling's US publisher, says the novel reminded him of Dickens \\"because of the humanity, the humor, the social concerns, the intensely real characters\\". No magic though, apparently: \\"This book isn't Harry Potter\\", says Pietsch. \\"It is a completely different concern\\". As with Harry Potter, there are no advance copies for the media, no early reviews. To date, the seven-book series has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, and it became one of the most successful movie franchises in July 21, 2007. Back then, fans could buy books at midnight parties hosted by bookstores. But recent years have seen a great challenge for brick-and-mortar bookstores. People are still buying books, indeed more books than in 2007, according to figures released by the Association of American Publishers. But they are reading them in a new format --the e-book. The Harry Potter series just became available digitally for the first time in April. It will be different for The Casual Vacancy, with the publisher _ releasing an e-book. For Rowling fans who once queued up for Harry Potter, this means that instant satisfaction is now only a click away. Moving from children's books to adult literature is a big transition. Will Rowling's new book be successful? Arthur Levine, the US co-editor of the Harry Potter books, seems confident: \\"If you read or re-read the Harry Potter books, you can see that Rowling has all the strengths she needs for great success as a fiction writer -you have great characters, an involving plot, a sense of humor and great empathy\\".

Rail riders along the California coast and the Boston-Washington \\"Northeast Corridor\\" are set to reap much of the benefits from 2 billion that Florida policymakers had earlier rejected for high-speed rail development. The Obama administration on Monday announced the reallocated funding, part of its push to spur environmentally friendly transportation and modernize the nation's infrastructure that's supported partly by the 2009 economic stimulus package. Fifteen states and Amtrak will receive the money to back 22 high-speed intercity passenger rail projects. Among other things, the funds will be used to improve speed and service in the Northeast, add faster rail lines in the Midwest and help spur more efficient train service between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nearly 300 million will be spent to reduce major delays for trains coming in and out of Manhattan -- the nation's busiest passenger rail junction. Within the next four years, high-speed rail advocate Petra Todorovich estimated trains between New York and Philadelphia will routinely move at 160 mph because of a host of upgrades aimed at improving \\"train speeds, capacity and reliability.\\" While billed as new funding, the money actually is previously pledged funds being directed to new recipients. Soon after taking office, Florida Gov. Rick Scott cited expected cost overruns and long-term operating costs for his call to block federal funding for an 84-mile-long high-speed rail line that would link Tampa and Orlando. Days after the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that allowed the Republican government to reject the federal money, the U.S. Transportation Department opened up a process to solicit fresh bids from other states and entities. It is all part of the 53 billion that the White House has proposed spending over the next six years to promote high-speed rail -- an initiative facing a chilly reception in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. \\"President Obama and I made a commitment to improve and expand America's transportation system,\\" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement. These new investments \\"will continue our progress toward making this vision a reality.\\" Biden, a regular Amtrak commuter between his home state of Delaware and Washington during his 36 years in the Senate, is known as a leading supporter of federally supported rail travel. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, on hand at New York's Penn Station for the announcement, insisted the funds will \\"help states across the country create jobs, spur economic development and boost manufacturing in their communities.\\" Obama said in January's State of the Union address that he was setting a goal of giving 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. The stimulus act has provided about 10.1 billion toward Obama's goal so far, according to the Transportation Department. \\"By 2050, the United States will be home to 100 million additional people -- the equivalent of another California, Texas, New York and Florida combined,\\" LaHood noted. \\"We simply cannot build enough highways and airports to accommodate this growth.\\" Supporters insist the emphasis on faster rail transportation is a necessary investment in the country's economic competitiveness. Critics contend it's little more than a massive boondoggle that is contributing to skyrocketing federal deficits while providing few proven benefits over the long term. Scott's decision this winter to reject what eventually worked out to 2 billion in federal funding for the Orlando-to-Tampa plan surprised a number of observers. This came after the Obama administration pulled another 1.2 billion in funding from Ohio and Wisconsin after their newly elected GOP governors vowed to kill high-speed rail projects that were under way. LaHood portrayed those cases Monday as relatively rare exceptions, noting that the Transportation Department received 10 billion worth of requests for the 2 billion available. \\"Who says America does not have a pent-up demand?\\" he asked. Amtrak officials note that they set a new annual ridership record of more than 28 million passengers for the last fiscal year. Regardless, the new spending makes little sense at the current time, according to Sam Staley, an analyst at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian-oriented Los Angeles-based think tank. The administration \\"seems to be completely deaf to the real concerns about whether this is a well thought out program,\\" Staley told CNN. \\"There are so many other transportation needs that are going unfunded, including just bring existing transit systems up to a good state of repair.\\" \\"I don't see how anyone looking at the numbers can say that high-speed rail is going to be a primary driver of economic growth\\" in the regions targeted by the new money, Staley said. \\"What it will do is supplement the existing transportation network and serve a very targeted niche of that market. But it's not going to be a broad-based transportation solution.\\" Todorovich, the director of the urban planning initiative America 2050, said she believed critics would continue to target the rail initiative because it is \\"one of Obama's signature initiatives.\\" But she believes such efforts run counter to the needs and wants of policymakers and citizens nationwide who want such infrastructure projects to go forward -- even if that's not true in Florida. \\"(This) announcement helps to restore public confidence in the program, as we see that many states around the country are ready to put Florida's unwanted funding to use,\\" she said.

With POP3 support, Gmail users will be able to transfer their messages to a client-side e-mail application and store the messages on their local hard drives, making them accessible off-line. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is discussing a feature of Gmail which supports the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3). POP3 is a standard email protocol that deals with the transmission and storage of email and it is used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. When the user is connected to the internet, the email client interacts with the server to download new emails to the user's local machine or device. In the context of Gmail, being one of the most popular web-based email services, this feature greatly enhances the flexibility and accessibility for its users. By using a POP3-supported email client application like Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Apple Mail, Gmail users can download and locally store their messages on their computer's hard drive rather than keeping them online on Gmail's server. This feature permits users to access, read, and manage these emails even when they are not connected to the internet. Once the emails are downloaded and stored locally, actions such as moving the emails to different folders, deleting them, or marking them as read will not affect the online version of those emails in the Gmail server. This is because, by default, POP3 protocol doesn't synchronize these actions between the email client and the server. However, it's important to note that users need to correctly configure their Gmail settings and the settings in their email client application to use the POP3 feature. If not properly set up, there is a risk of messages being permanently deleted from the server when they are downloaded to the local machine. In summary, the text is about leveraging POP3 support on Gmail to enhance user convenience. It allows users to manage their email off-line by transferring messages from Gmail's servers to a client-side email application, thereby storing them on their local hard drives for offline access."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Ziziphus - Ziziphus /ˈzɪzɨfəs/ is a genus of about 40 species of spiny shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical regions throughout the world.

His companion Elaine becomes concerned and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935, which took place when he was a prison officer, in charge of death row and the state's electric chair. In 1935, Paul supervises fellow officers Brutus \\"Brutal\\" Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary on what they refer to as the \\"Green Mile\\", Death Row. Paul is suffering from a severe bladder infection and receives John Coffey, a physically imposing but mentally challenged black man, into his custody. John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls. One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak but is beyond reproach; he is the nephew of Louisiana's First Lady, but only Paul is bold enough to defy this. He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard \\"Del\\" Delacroix; he breaks Del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles, which Del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head; Del's body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain. John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures Paul's bladder infection, resurrects Mr. Jingles, and heals Melinda Moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. This last affliction he releases into Percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer William Wharton, dead. Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions later which caused Paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped Percy briefly, racially insulted John, and revealed psychically to...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will postpone a test vote next week on a bill to fight online piracy and counterfeiting, after a storm of protest from Internet companies and search engines who fear overregulation and censorship. The protests included a blackout by Wikipedia this week and a petition by Google that generated more than seven million signatures. Now at least a half-dozen senators who sponsored the measure say they oppose it. Reid says he's optimistic about reaching a compromise that protects Americans' intellectual property and maintains openness and innovation on the Internet. ||||| WASHINGTON—The push for antipiracy legislation brought lawmakers together for much of the past year, but in the Senate at least, the support that remains after nationwide protests appears to be mostly from Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is moving ahead with plans for a test vote on the legislation Tuesday, but the Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, on Thursday called for a postponement, citing \\"serious issues with this legislation.\\" At least 14 Republican senators announced their opposition to the legislation this week as thousands of Internet sites, including online encyclopedia Wikipedia, went dark Wednesday to protest the bills. Seven Democratic senators said they either had serious concerns or couldn't support the legislation in its current form, adding their voices to a handful of Democrats who had previously opposed the bill. The House and Senate are considering similar legislation—known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, in the House—aimed at cracking down on foreign-based websites that offer pirated movies, music and other content. The bills have received strong backing from the Hollywood studios and unions, which say the pirated sites are costing both money and jobs.. Google Inc., eBay Inc. and other Internet companies say the legislation would harm the Web's open nature and could lead to more lawsuits against U.S. Internet sites that inadvertently host pirated content. Google said Thursday that over seven million people had signed its online protest petition. The battle has scrambled the usual Washington lines. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and labor unions, usually rivals, back the bills, while many activist groups on both the left and the right oppose them. For most Republicans, pressure from vocal opponents is adding up to a no vote, or at least a \\"not yet\\" position. Some worry that the enforcement that's authorized could hurt U.S. cybersecurity efforts. It's a tougher call for some Democrats, thanks in part to the bill's strong union backing and the fact that Hollywood has opened its collective wallet wider for Democrats historically. The bill is a top priority of the Motion Picture Association of America, which hired veteran Democratic senator Chris Dodd as its chairman last year. Mr. Dodd is barred from lobbying former colleagues now, but he remains friends with many of them. The legislation has been particularly tricky for California lawmakers trying to balance the needs of both Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein met with Google and Facebook Inc. and other bill opponents to explain her support. A spokesman said Thursday that she \\"recognizes the bill needs further changes.\\" —Amy Schatz ||||| Hollywood's top lobbyist and former Sen. Chris Dodd is threatening to cut off campaign funds to President Obama's re-election effort because of anger over the White House appearing to side with tech companies in a bitter fight over anti-piracy legislation. In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Dodd fired off a warning to Obama -- his former Senate Democratic colleague in this election year -- \\"don't take us for granted.\\" \\"Candidly, those who count on quote 'Hollywood' for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake,\\" Dodd told Fox News. \\"Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.\\" Dodd, who became CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America after leaving the Senate in 2011, noted the movie \\"Avatar\\" was stolen by online pirates 21 million times. Such acts, he said, threaten to decimate his industry. \\"You can complain and say, well, actors make a lot of money and they don't have to worry about this,\\" said Dodd. \\"You tell that to that camera guy, you tell that to that makeup artist, you tell that to that truck driver out there who made, makes a living because they work in this industry.\\" \\"Avatar\\" was made by 20th Century Fox which, like Fox News Channel, is owned by NewsCorp. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of NewsCorp, has also been outspoken in promoting two pieces of anti-piracy legislation, the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act, known respectively as \\"SOPA\\" and \\"PIPA,\\" to protect copyrighted material. Tech companies like Google charge that such a crackdown would result in censorship. Dodd said he was caught off-guard when the White House released a written statement last Saturday sharing some of the tech community's concerns about the legislation. \\"I would caution people don't make the assumption that because the quote 'Hollywood community' has been historically supportive of Democrats, which they have, don't make the false assumptions this year that because we did it in years past, we will do it this year,\\" said Dodd. \\"These issues before us -- this is the only issue that goes right to the heart of this industry.\\" Vice President Biden, in Reno, Nev. on Thursday, said that he met with tech officials Wednesday night and was meeting Thursday evening with Hollywood studio chiefs to try and broker a legislation deal. A White House official later told Fox News the vice president isn't brokering a deal, suggesting Biden misspoke. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney earlier this week stressed the administration did not take sides last Saturday and is simply trying to find the right balance to come up with reform that both sides can live with. \\"Our firm belief is that we need to do something about online piracy by foreign websites, but we need to do it in a way that does not impinge upon a free and open Internet,\\" Carney said. Meanwhile, it's unclear if Dodd will follow through on the threats --- or whether it will matter. Hollywood has so far ponied up over 4.1 million to the Obama re-election campaign. That's already higher than the 3.7 million it gave him in the 2008 campaign, according to Opensecrets.org. Several months remain for more money to flow. In addition, any lost Hollywood support could be made up with votes and dollars from the tech community, which is lobbying the issue just as aggressively. Fox News has learned from Democratic sources that several tech company officials attended a fundraiser for the president in Washington last Friday, one day before the White House publicly expressed its concerns about the proposed legislation that angered Hollywood so much. While the fundraising event itself was on the president's public schedule, details of who attended were not released by the White House last Friday. Fox News on Thursday asked the Obama campaign to release the names of attendees but so far that has not been done. An Obama campaign official did confirm \\"the event included both supporters who work for technology companies and those who do not.\\" The campaign official said there was no connection between Friday's fundraiser and Saturday's announcement on the legislation, and noted the president does not take money from federal lobbyists so none was in attendance at the fundraiser. Other company officials for some of the tech companies, however, were there. The president's re-election team also notes it has a broad base of financial support, and does not seem to be sweating any potential cutoff of more money than it's already received from Hollywood. \\"This campaign is fueled by donations from more than 1.3 million Americans who come from different backgrounds and might disagree on some issues but contribute to the campaign because they believe in the president's vision to restore economic security for the middle class and to build an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility,\\" said the Obama campaign official. ||||| The European Union's Internet czar on Friday added her voice to resistance to the Stop Online Piracy Act, in an unusually open comment on pending U.S. legislation. \\"Glad tide is turning on SOPA: don't need bad legislation when should be safeguarding benefits of open net,\\" Neelie Kroes, the EU's Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, said in a Twitter message. The piece of legislation, currently in the House of Representatives, would allow the U.S. Justice Department to target legitimate sites where users share pirated content. Outrage over SOPA earlier this week triggered a one-day blackout by Wikipedia's English-language service and other popular websites and sparked growing scrutiny of the bill. The EU is also working to tackle online piracy, but is trying hard to do so without restricting Internet freedom. \\"Speeding is illegal too: but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway,\\" Kroes said in a second tweet. The EU usually avoids openly criticizing pending legislation in the U.S, one of its biggest political allies and trading partners. But politicians on different sides of the Atlantic often don't see eye to eye when it comes to regulating the Internet. The Commissioner's spokesman defended Kroes's comments, pointing to the widespread criticism of the bill. \\"It shows that people do have very serious concerns about their access to the Internet and it shows that in addition to enforcement, which is very important, we need to be increasing the number of legal content offers that are available online,\\" Ryan Heath told reporters. He added that the EU already has legislation in place to fight online piracy and is currently working on an overhaul of it's rules for intellectual property rights in an effort to make it easier to obtain the rights to distribute content online legally. Kroes, one of the most outspoken commissioners who imposed massive fines against Microsoft during her time as the EU's antitrust regulator, has embraced new media. Also on Friday, she asked her more than 32,000 followers on Twitter to comment on the shutdown of popular file-sharing site Megaupload.com on her department's Facebook page. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to postpone a test vote on a bill against online piracy and counterfeiting after protests from internet companies and search engines, who were concerned about overregulation and censorship.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Prince and Me Movie plot: The movie opens with med-student bound Paige Morgan receiving a birthday cake from her teachers and colleagues. She suddenly realizes she is late for something and hurries out of the school and drives home. She has no time to talk to her mother as she goes to her room, grabs a dress from her closet, and hops in her truck. Meanwhile, in the country of Denmark we see the young & rebellious Prince Edvard and his servant, Soren, meeting up with a young man for what seems to be a race of some sort. Back in America, Paige is driving to a friend's wedding; she arrives in her father's pick up and nearly runs over half of the wedding party. At the reception, she and a friend discuss the subject of romance and marriage, neither of which Paige has time for because of her focus on her career. The bouquet is tossed, and by some twist of fate, it lands right in Paige's lap. Back in Denmark, the race is about to start; the cars speed down the open road and Edvard wins the race, where he is greeted with a threesome involving two teenage girls. He then realizes that, like Paige, he is also late for something very important. At the castle, 12-year-old Princess Arabella is playing a Gameboy as Edvard's parents, King Haraald and Queen Rosalind, wait anxiously for their eldest child to arrive before they are shown in public. Edvard arrives and is greeted with a hug by Arabella, though his parents don't seem so happy. He takes Arabella's arm and they step out onto the balcony. Later, Edvard and King Haraald are to meet with some members of the board; Haraald warns his son to behave himself, and Edvard glumly agrees. As they enter the room to sit down Haraald gets a bit dizzy, but when asked if he is all right he insists that he is fine. The meeting goes on. Edvard could care less about business and politics and he intentionally flirts with one of the women present.

First question: What is the history of government? Second question: What is the history of the government of Nepal? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [I] no. [II] yes.","completion":"To answer both questions, I will research and provide a brief overview of the histories. First question: What is the history of government? Step 1: Research the origins of government systems Justification: Understanding the beginnings of government systems will provide insight into their early development. Governments have existed in various forms throughout human history. The earliest known forms of government were tribal, where decision-making and leadership were shared among a small group of individuals. As societies grew more complex, so did their governments, with the emergence of city-states in ancient Sumer and Egypt. Step 2: Explore various government systems throughout history Justification: By examining different types of governments, we can better understand how they evolved over time. Some notable examples include the Greek city-states with their mixed forms of government, the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire, the Chinese dynastic rule, and the European feudal system. The modern nation-state emerged in the 17th century, and various systems like democracy, monarchy, and dictatorship continue to evolve today. Second question: What is the history of the government of Nepal? Step 1: Research the early history of Nepal's government Justification: Understanding the early stages of Nepal's government will provide a basis for its evolution. Nepal has a long history that can be traced back to the Kirat period (800 BCE - 300 CE), followed by the Licchavi period (300 - 750 CE) and the Malla period (1200 - 1769 CE). During these periods, various small kingdoms and principalities were governed by monarchs and local rulers. Step 2: Explore the unification of Nepal and the Shah Dynasty Justification: The unification of Nepal under the Shah Dynasty is a significant event in its governmental history. In the late 18th century, King Prithvi Narayan Shah unified the various kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Nepal. The Shah Dynasty ruled until 2008, during which time the government underwent significant changes. In 1990, pro-democracy movements led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy with a multi-party system. Step 3: Discuss the transition to a republic and the current government system Justification: The establishment of a republic marks another significant change in Nepal's governmental history. In 2008, following a decade-long Maoist insurgency, the monarchy was abolished, and Nepal was declared a federal democratic republic. The current government system in Nepal is a federal parliamentary republic, with power shared between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country.

In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent.

Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates.

I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated.

Moreover, upon attempting to claim the wages they rightfully earned and threatening to contact the labor board, the company dismissed their claims, stating there was no record of their employment and denying any owed payment.

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. What is an answer for this question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information, we can conclude the following: Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells (gametes) and can be passed on to the next generation. Somatic mutations occur in body cells and cannot be passed on to the next generation. In the situation presented, Dan studied multicellular organisms with mutations. Group A had germline mutations, and Group B had somatic mutations. Now we can address the question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Since germline mutations involve mutations in the DNA of sex cells and Group A organisms presented with germline mutations, it means that Group A had more organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells. Therefore, Group B (with somatic mutations) had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He is haunted by memories of Paro, his childhood love, whom he could not marry due to a difference in social status. Feeling unsupported by his family, Devdas decides to take a week off work and go on a solitary journey to find himself and search for meaning in his life. While on the journey, Devdas takes inspiration from the movies he loves and imagines a train ride that would take him back to his past, where he comes across different people who have made an impact on his life. On this \\"Train of Memories\\": 1. Young Devdas - An energetic, but insecure boy, eager to impress Paro and explore life beyond his village. 2. Paro - Devdas' childhood love, who represents the pure, unadulterated love he lost due to societal pressures. 3.

An investment banker found dead after trying to climb the Northeast's highest peak was using a broken emergency beacon and could have saved herself if she turned her cellphone on, rescuers have claimed. Kate Matrosova, 32, dropped off by her husband Charlie Farhoodi at the base of New Hampshire's 5,400ft Mount Madison at 5am last Sunday. Within hours she had activated an emergency beacon amid but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard because mountaineers say the sub-zero temperatures prevented it from working properly. Her body was discovered 24 hours later, with emergency responders being sent in the wrong direction by the faulty technology. Others have said it was 'negligent' for her to be up there and her decisions showed her 'inexperience'. Tragic: BNP Paribas credit trader Kate Matrosova, 32, was found dead 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked up Mount Madison. Married: Matrosova was dropped off at the range at 5am on Sunday by husband Charlie Farhoodi (left) who is listed on LinkedIn as the Vice President of JP Morgan. The couple shared a 1 million apartment in Manhattan. Emergency: A search team was unable to locate Matrosova (pictured in January) for 24 hours after her call. When she activated the tracking device, it triggered an instantaneous alert at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. Operators called the number associated with account, but it went straight to voicemail because her phone was switched off. It meant no one dialed 911 until her husband, who was sitting in his hotel room at the time, was contacted by staff at the Florida base. Volunteer mountain rescuer Steve Larson told the Boston Globe if they had Mastrova's correct location they would not have spent hours trekking through the woodland in the wrong direction. 'One lesson in all this, for all of this whiz-bang technology, it obviously is not spot-on,' he said. Fish and Game Lieutenant Wayne Saunders said her beacon was designed to function in temperatures as low as minus 20. But he said the air was far colder, meaning it could have tricked the technology. Mike Pelchat, a states park employee, added: 'Maybe she relied a little too much on the technology. Maybe she thought she could turn back. But the temperatures, and the wind, got the best of her.' Max Lurie, 28, who responded to the second Mountain Rescue Service call, told the Globe: 'It was cold — one of the coldest nights of the year — and the wind was howling. I don’t go up there when there are conditions like that. 'It was negligent for her to be up there. Her decision clearly speaks to her inexperience.' Grueling: Mt Madison (pictured, not with Matrosova) was hit by 100 mph winds and a blizzard on Sunday night. She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet. Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a 1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim. As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F. The BNP Paribas credit trader sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon. After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back. 'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV. Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range. She was found between Mt Madison and Mt Adams (top right), believed to have died from exposure to the cold. Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own. Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams. A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area. 'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.' It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006. Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser. In 2012, she attended Harvard University Extension School to study Numerical Analysis before obtaining a masters in financial engineering from the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 2013. Vice President: Widower Charlie Farhoodi's job on LinkedIn is listed as Vice President of JP Morgan. Tribute: This picture was posted on Facebook in tribute to Matrosova with a friend called her 'a vibrant spirit' After interning for a year at BNP Paribas, she accepted the role of Credit Trading Associate in August 2014. Based on Facebook pictures, she appeared to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. Her interests are listed on LinkedIn as mountain climbing, judo and scuba diving. Friends and relatives paid tribute to Matrosova online, posting pictures of the 32-year-old. One wrote: 'Rest in peace...' with a photograph of Matrosova hiking through sunlight snowy woodland. Another described her as 'a vibrant spirit'. A blizzard watch was issued for coastal New England over the weekend that touched on the edge of the White Mountain National Forest, which encompasses the Presidential Range. The region saw up to 14 inches of snow in some areas.

Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identifying the premise given in the problem Usage: \\"Tim was out on a hike in the desert.\\" Explanation: This is the first sentence of the story, and it sets the overall theme and location for the story, which is Tim hiking in the desert. Part #2: Analyzing the initial context and original ending Usage: Initial Context - \\"He ran into a rattlesnake.\\" Original Ending - \\"Tim got bit before he knew it. He called 911 and asked for help. They were able to give him antivenom.\\" Explanation: The initial context gives us more information about the story's plot, i.e., Tim encounters a rattlesnake, and the original ending tells us how he gets bitten and receives antivenom treatment. Part #3: Identifying the new ending given in the problem Usage: \\"Tim got dehydrated before he knew it. He called 911 and asked for help. They were able to give him water.\\" Explanation: The new ending provides an alternative conclusion to the story, focusing on Tim getting dehydrated and needing water instead of the antivenom for the snake bite. Part #4: Creating the counterfactual context based on the premise and new ending Usage: \\"He became thirsty but didn't have enough water.\\" Explanation: This counterfactual context slightly modifies the initial context to align with the new ending. Instead of running into a rattlesnake, Tim becomes thirsty and doesn't have enough water, leading to dehydration and the need for help and water provided in the new ending."},{"prompt":"Fact 1: Sweating reduces body heat.

She described pushing 22-year-old Savanna Greywind, whom she'd lured to her apartment, the Bismarck Tribune reports; Greywind hit her head on the bathroom sink and lost consciousness. Crews said she then cut the baby out of Greywind's body using a box cutter. Crews, testifying in Hoehn's trial on conspiracy to commit murder charges, said she never \\"explicitly\\" told Hoehn she planned to kill Greywind and take her baby, and that Hoehn appeared surprised when he walked into the bathroom.

Rowling or Martin Luther King Jr. who have proven to be strong and intelligent people. However, in today's world, stars are regarded as role models along with the heroes listed above, despite their intentions or actions. Teens attempt to imitate their actions for two major reasons. First, to be fashionable and accepted by popular culture, and second>>because stars' actions are so well documented by the media that it seems to grab our attention and turns it to following stars' lives. Much of the reports about stars is shocking and exhibits bad morals or lifestyles that aren't right for teenagers. In addition, almost everything stars do is described beyond truth to make a shocking story by taking it to the next level. However, teens must take responsibility for their actions. We can't always blame stars for influencing us. Only you have control over yourself and only you choose to do something. Our bodies and actions are in the hands of no one else. Now, who ever said stars are role models? Whether they choose to be or not, stars set examples as soon as they step into the spotlight. With reporters following and recording every move they make, it is impossible not to be watched and then be imitated. These people influence, teens whether or not they want to. Why should someone who doesn't want to be setting an example set one? So,should we look up to them or to people who are true and good role models?

This implies that the conversation must centre around the closure of an airport. Step 2: Develop context To build a logical conversation, I'll first imagine a setting where such a discussion could happen. A scenario could be someone who needs to travel or an individual working in a job related to airline/airport services. Step 3: Construct characters and relationships Next, let's construct two characters. For instance, one could be a person who is planning to travel and the other might be a travel agent. Their relationship could be a business one. Step 4: Formulate the conversation Now, let's write the conversation. The traveler might inquire about flight availability, and the travel agent will relate the closure of the airport. Since we want 'The airport is closed' to be what we learn, that has to be the key point of the conversation. Here is a conversation that fulfills the given requirements: Traveler: \\"Hi, I'm planning a trip to Los Angeles for the weekend. Can you check for any available flights?\\" Travel Agent: \\"I'm sorry, but due to adverse weather conditions, Los Angeles airport is closed until further notice.\\" Traveler: \\"Oh, that's unfortunate!

Die Europäische Union (EU) spielt eine zentrale Rolle in der heutigen Zeit, insbesondere in Bezug auf ihre Fähigkeit, Solidarität und Unterstützung für ihre Mitgliedstaaten bereitzustellen. Diese Unterstützung erfolgt insbesondere in Form von Finanzinstrumenten und Strukturfonds, die zur Förderung der wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und territorialen Zusammenarbeit in Europa beitragen. Ein solches Instrument ist der Solidaritätsfonds der EU, der Mitteleuropa dabei unterstützen soll, auf Naturkatastrophen und große Krisensituationen zu reagieren. Dieser Fonds kann beispielsweise zur Unterstützung von Ländern eingesetzt werden, die von Überschwemmungen, Erdbeben oder schweren Industrieunfällen betroffen sind. Die Strukturfonds hingegen sind ein zentrales Element der EU-Regionalpolitik. Sie bestehen aus dem Europäischen Fonds für regionale Entwicklung (EFRE) und dem Europäischen Sozialfonds (ESF). Der EFRE zielt darauf ab, die wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen Europas zu verringern, indem er in Projekte investiert, die Wachstum, Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Arbeitsplätze fördern. Der ESF hingegen konzentriert sich auf die Verbesserung der Beschäftigungsfähigkeit der Bürgerinnen und Bürger Europas und die Förderung sozialer Integration und Chancengleichheit.

Mark Twain one said, \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\" Well I tried, and after about 75 pages, I had to put this book down. The reason? A curious writing style more attuned to an historical novel than serious history. And although some may appreciate this style, I found it longwinded and short on substance. Additionally, the course of the war, in general, is difficult to follow because it is told via interconnected vignettes as seen by lower ranking GIs; there are no references (and many times no attribution at all) as to where the author gained his information or how they fit into the bigger picture.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Options: - desk drawer - purse - bank - keep accounts - keep track of emails Explain why a human would choose \\"bank\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"bank\\" to answer the question above because an account book is a financial record used to keep track of transactions such as income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Banks are financial institutions that primarily deal with these types of transactions. They offer services like managing accounts, providing loans, and facilitating investments. In banks, account books are essential for maintaining accurate records of all financial transactions taking place. While the other options might have some relation to an account book, they do not provide a clear connection to the purpose of the account book itself: - Desk drawer: an account book may be stored in a desk drawer, but the drawer itself does not use or maintain the account book. - Purse: similar to the desk drawer, an account book might be stored in a purse, but it is not where the account book is used or maintained. - Keep accounts: this phrase refers to the action of maintaining financial records, but it doesn't specify an institution or entity that would use an account book for this purpose. - Keep track of emails: while this is an organizational activity, it is unrelated to financial records and the use of an account book. Emails can be extremely helpful in keeping track of correspondence and document attachments, but they are not directly related to financial transactions. Hence, the most appropriate and relevant option for using an account book is a \\"bank,\\" as it is directly involved in managing and keeping track of financial transactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who led the Iceni against the Romans","completion":"Boudica, also known as Boudicca or Boadicea, was the queen who led the Iceni tribe against the Romans in a significant uprising in 60 or 61 AD. The Iceni were a Celtic tribe that inhabited the area of modern-day Norfolk, eastern Cambridgeshire, and northern Suffolk in England during the late Iron Age and early Roman Britain. Boudica was married to Prasutagus, the king of the Iceni. Prasutagus had maintained a cooperative relationship with the Roman Empire during his rule, seeking to preserve Iceni independence by becoming a client-king under Emperor Nero's reign. This relationship allowed the Iceni tribe to enjoy a certain degree of autonomy while still being part of the Roman Empire. When Prasutagus died around 60 AD, he left a will that bequeathed half of his kingdom to his daughters, while the other half was intended for the Roman Emperor Nero to maintain this alliance. However, the Romans disregarded Prasutagus' will and instead chose to annex the entire Iceni kingdom, treating it as conquered territory. They confiscated the property of the Iceni elite, subjected Boudica to a brutal flogging, and allowed her daughters to be raped. These violent acts provoked Boudica and the Iceni people to rise in rebellion against Roman rule. Boudica, being a charismatic and courageous leader, amassed a sizeable force by allying with other tribes, notably the Trinovantes, who also harbored resentment toward the Romans. Together, they launched a violent revolt against the Roman occupation in Britain. The insurgents targeted the Roman settlements of Camulodunum (now Colchester), Londinium (now London), and Verulamium (now St. Albans), burning and razing them to the ground. It's estimated that over 70,000 Roman citizens and allies were killed during the revolt. Roman Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, who was campaigning in present-day Wales at the time, quickly gathered and led a considerably smaller Roman force against Boudica's army. Despite being outnumbered, they were able to achieve a decisive victory in an unnamed battle, now known as the Battle of Watling Street, owing to their superior military tactics, discipline, and organization. Boudica's army suffered heavy casualties, effectively ending the rebellion. Following the defeat, Boudica allegedly poisoned herself to avoid capture and humiliation by the Romans. The details of her death remain uncertain, as various ancient sources offer different accounts. Nonetheless, the story of Boudica and her rebellion remains an iconic symbol of resistance and defiance against the powerful Roman Empire, and she is still celebrated today as a British national heroine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"A man stands on a ladder doing some sort of work while he slowly gains public attention.\\", is the sentence \\"The man is sitting on a chair.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A man stands on a ladder doing some sort of work while he slowly gains public attention,\\" the sentence \\"The man is sitting on a chair.\\" cannot be considered a true statement. The reason for this is that there is a clear discrepancy between the positioning of the man in both sentences. In the original sentence, the man is described as standing on a ladder while performing some kind of work. This suggests that he is elevated and actively engaging in a task. Additionally, the fact that he gradually garners public attention might imply that his work is either noticeable or intriguing to those around him. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the man is sitting on a chair. \\"Sitting\\" denotes a different posture from \\"standing\\" and implies a more static or inactive position compared to the original scenario. Moreover, the mention of a chair as opposed to a ladder changes the context and location in which the man is found. A chair is typically used for resting or sitting tasks, while a ladder serves as a tool for ascending and reaching higher spaces. It is important to note that both sentences are not mutually exclusive in a broader context. For instance, the man could be initially standing on the ladder and then later switch to sitting on a chair after completing his work. However, when examined solely based on the information provided in each individual sentence, they describe vastly differing situations. To concur, the sentence \\"The man is sitting on a chair.\\" cannot be regarded as a true statement when referring to the specific scenario described in the original sentence. The change in the man's position, the tool he is using, and the potential nature of his activity contributes to this conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \\"Dingo.\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star. She made sure all his bills were paid, his animals were fed, and that the subsequent fallout from any parties she might have in his absence didn't leave any lasting damage. She was pretty by most standards, gorgeous by others. Short with a tight schoolgirl body and raven hair that teased her avian shoulders.

Context: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. Question: Why was the daughter devestated?

Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: \\"He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me.\\" Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans' music video \\"Aankhon Mein\\", the producer Ramesh Taurani was keen to cast him in a film. However, upon meeting him, Taurani thought Kapoor, who was 20 years old at the time, to be too young and underweight to become an actor, and encouraged him to wait for a few years. Kapoor, meanwhile, turned down a lead role in N. Chandra's sex comedy Style in hopes of working with Taurani. Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance Ishq Vishk (2003), which Ken Ghosh was directing for his company. Kapoor, who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build, was eventually hired. Before beginning work on the film, he attended acting workshops with Naseeruddin Shah and Satyadev Dubey. Ishq Vishk tells the story of Rajiv Mathur (Kapoor), a high-school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities (played by Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywala). Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films. Writing for The Hindu, the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be \\"hero material\\", adding that \\"boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face - but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department.\\" The film, however, proved to be a sleeper hit at the box office and won Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. Following his debut, Kapoor reunited with Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk. The thriller Fida (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman (Kareena Kapoor) and her lover (Fardeen Khan) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor \\"shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy, who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies.\\" Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil Maange More in which he was paired opposite three women: Soha Ali Khan, Tulip Joshi, and Ayesha Takia. Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan's acting style. Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful. The series of poorly received films continued in 2005, when all three of Kapoor's films failed at the box office. His first two releases that year were the comedies Deewane Huye Paagal and Vaah! Life Ho Toh Aisi!, both of which were largely panned. The former was plagiarised from the Hollywood film There's Something About Mary in which Kapoor played one of Rimi Sen's love interests; the critic Khalid Mohamed found Kapoor to be \\"the only likeable element in this travesty\\" but Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled him \\"colourless\\" and criticised his pairing with Sen. His final role was that of a righteous teenager drawn towards a life of indulgence in John Matthew Matthan's drama Shikhar, co-starring Ajay Devgan, Bipasha Basu and Amrita Rao. The critic Sukanya Verma found Kapoor to be miscast as a village boy in the film, but noted that he was \\"never short of spontaneity and youthful exuberance\\". So, was there another movie?","completion":"Yes, Shahid Kapoor's career continued after 2005, and he went on to act in numerous movies. In 2006, he starred in the romantic drama \\"Vivah,\\" directed by Sooraj R. Barjatya, which became one of his major commercial successes. He played the role of Prem, who follows the Indian tradition of arranged marriage. The film received positive reviews, and Kapoor's performance was well-received. Kapoor continued working in various films throughout the years, including notable roles in \\"Jab We Met\\" (2007), \\"Kaminey\\" (2009), \\"Haider\\" (2014), \\"Udta Punjab\\" (2016), and \\"Kabir Singh\\" (2019).

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was developed by the federal government as a segregated community? ? The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

When she arrived she realized it was too good to be true. There were red solo cups everywhere, Toby lived in a frat house. Can we infer the following? Toby only drinks alcohol out of red solo cups.","completion":"While it may be tempting to make such an inference, it would be too hasty to definitively conclude that Toby only drinks alcohol out of red solo cups based solely on the fact that Erin found a lot of red solo cups in his frat house when she went back to his place after their blind date. Here's a more detailed analysis of the situation that can help us understand the factors and reasons that lead to this conclusion. 1. Situational context: Toby and Erin's date location –a frat house– might suggest that the abundance of red solo cups could be related to its typical usage in popular party games like beer pong or flip cup. This implies that their widespread presence in such a setting could just be an indication of the house's inhabitants participating in these games or hosting parties where they play these games regularly. Toby may choose to drink alcohol from red solo cups when he takes part in such activities, but it doesn't confirm that this is his only mode of alcohol consumption. 2. Association with other people: Since Toby lives in a frat house, it's important to consider that he shares the living space with several other individuals. As a result, the abundance of red solo cups could be attributed to other residents hosting parties and events where alcohol is served in red solo cups, and it might not necessarily be a reflection of Toby's specific drinking preference. 3. Red solo cups' other potential uses: Red solo cups are not just used for drinking alcohol; they might also be utilized for non-alcoholic beverages or even as containers for snacks in casual settings. Therefore, the presence of numerous red solo cups throughout the house may not directly imply that Toby uses them primarily for alcohol. 4. Limited information: Our knowledge of Toby is limited to his blind date with Erin and the fact that he lives in a frat house with many red solo cups. Drawing a firm conclusion about his drinking preferences from this narrow set of observations would be premature. 5. Openness to alternatives: Toby being the full package, as described by Erin, might imply that he has a diverse set of interests and tastes. This means he might be open to using different types of cups or glassware for his alcoholic beverages depending on the situation or event. In summary, while it's possible that Toby might frequently use red solo cups for alcohol in specific contexts such as parties or games, it would be an overgeneralization to conclude that he only drinks alcohol out of red solo cups in every situation. We must consider the broader context in which the red cups were found, Toby's shared living situation, and the possibility of alternative usage scenarios before making such an inference.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: A giant walrus for the following movie plot: Sinbad (Patrick Wayne), sailor and Prince of Baghdad, moors at Charak, intent on seeking permission from Prince Kassim to marry Kassim's sister, Princess Farah (Jane Seymour). He quickly gets used to the city and its people, but finds it under curfew. When he shelters in a nearby tent, a witch (whom the audience later learns is Zenobia) summons a trio of ghouls, which emerge from a fire. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls. Meanwhile, Farah and Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), turn Kassim into a baboon (one of Harryhausen's stop-motion creations) just as he was going to be crowned caliph. If Kassim cannot regain his human form within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will be caliph instead. Sinbad meets with Farah, who believes Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells. Sinbad, Farah, and the baboon Kassim set off to find the old Greek alchemist named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), a hermit of on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break the spell. Zenobia and her son, Rafi (Kurt Christian), follow in a boat propelled by the robotic bronze Minoton, a magical creature created by the sorceress which looks like a Minotaur. During the voyage, Farah proves to be the only person capable of calming the baboon. Sinbad is convinced that the baboon is Kassim after he witnesses it playing chess with Farah. Sinbad and Farah land at Casgar and find Melanthius and his daughter Dione (Taryn Power), who agree to help them. Melanthius says they must travel to the land of Hyperborea where the ancient civilization of the Arimaspi once existed. On the way to Hyperborea, Melanthius and Dione also become convinced that the baboon is Kassim. Zenobia uses a potion to transform herself into a gull to spy on Sinbad. Once aboard his ship, she turns into a miniature human and listens in as Melanthius tells Sinbad how to cure Kassim. Alerted by Kassim, Melanthius and Sinbad capture Zenobia. Unfortunately, her potion spills and a wasp ingests some of it. The wasp grows to enormous size and attacks the two...

Both sentences convey the same meaning, as they indicate that prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty in the case involving Lee. In the first sentence, it is stated that prosecutors filed a motion to inform Lee of their intentions. In the second sentence, it is simply stated that the prosecutors will pursue the death penalty. While there may be slight differences in the way this information is presented, the core message remains the same in both instances. The first sentence provides a bit more detail, as it mentions that a motion has been filed. This implies that the decision to seek the death penalty has been made within the legal process and that the prosecutors are following proper legal procedures in communicating their intentions to the defendant. The second sentence, on the other hand, is more succinct and relays the information straightforwardly—that the prosecutors have decided to seek the death penalty. While it does not mention the filing of a motion, it can be inferred that the legal process will still by adhered to, as this is standard practice in cases involving capital punishment.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which state had more people inhaling organic chemicals from the wildfire smoke? Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return. Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","completion":"Washington state had more people inhaling organic chemicals from the wildfire smoke. Since the paragraph mentions that Washington state had many wildfires year-round, while Oregon had almost no wildfires, it is logical to infer that the exposure to wildfire smoke and its components, including organic chemicals, would be higher in Washington state. This higher exposure would result in a larger number of people inhaling organic chemicals in Washington compared to Oregon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? A. for a few hours B. for a few minutes C. not enough information D. for a few days Answer:","completion":"B. for a few minutes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I lost my hairless dumbo rattie suddenly a few months ago. He was very young still Predict the sentiment of this tweet. Available options: [+] negative [+] positive","completion":"Based on an analysis of the content, emotions, and words used in the tweet, it appears to be predominantly negative in sentiment. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. The use of the word \\"loss\\": This word automatically indicates that someone or something has been lost, which commonly brings about negative emotions. In the context of this tweet, the user @alteredattic seems to have experienced the loss of a pet or a loved one. As a result, sadness and grief are likely to be the dominant emotions felt by the user and evoked in others. 2. The phrase \\"I lost my hairless dumbo rattie\\": This statement specifies the source of the loss, which is the user's beloved pet. Losing a pet can be a deeply emotional and painful experience for animal lovers, as pets often become cherished family members. Thus, this statement contributes to the overall negative sentiment of the tweet. 3. The word \\"suddenly\\": The fact that the loss happened suddenly implies that it was unexpected and, therefore, more shocking to the user. The lack of time for emotional preparation or anticipation of the loss exacerbates the associated negative feelings. 4. The mention of \\"a few months ago\\": This reference to the passage of time may suggest that the user is still mourning the loss of their pet. While the tweet may not be strictly negative in expressing these feelings, it is evident that the grief and sadness it evokes carry significant emotional weight. 5. The statement \\"He was very young still\\": By emphasizing that the pet was still young at the time of its passing, the user highlights the apparent unfairness of the situation and the potential life experiences they were denied. This acknowledgment adds an additional layer of negative sentiment to the tweet. Considering these factors, the sentiment of the tweet can be classified as negative. However, it is important to note that the user is also reaching out to another person (@alteredattic) in an empathetic manner, creating a sense of connection and shared experience. While this element does not necessarily make the tweet positive, it does demonstrate that emotions can be complex, and people often communicate to support one another during difficult times."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What year did the football team inthe most educated, highest-income, and fourth largest combined statistical area in the United States join the Big Ten Conference?

Information: - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. - In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons and/or protons). The difference in mass between the products and reactants is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \\"binding energy\\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \\"main sequence\\" stars, or other high magnitude stars. - Neutron radiation is a kind of ionizing radiation which consists of free neutrons. A result of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion, it consists of the release of free neutrons from atoms, and these free neutrons react with nuclei of other atoms to form new isotopes, which, in turn, may produce radiation. - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. - The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - Embrittlement is a loss of ductility of a material, making it brittle. Various materials have different mechanisms of embrittlement. - Neutron - induced swelling is the increase of volume and decrease of density of materials subjected to intense neutron radiation . Neutrons impacting the material 's lattice rearrange its atoms , causing buildup of dislocations , voids , and Wigner energy . Together with the resulting strength reduction and embrittlement , it is a major concern for materials for nuclear reactors . Materials show significant differences in their swelling resistance .

Article: The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned.

The legates agreed to change if they could find a strong leader. The prior took up the challenge, and he and Dominic dedicated themselves to the conversion of the Albigensians.

Stroebele said he had suggested Snowden testify before German lawmakers and that the former NSA contractor responded that in fact he wants to testify in Washington.

He didn't speak much to the customers or to his helpers, but when he did he spoke slowly and quietly, as if to himself. He believed in efficiency, not conversation. And this was how the office workers, rushing to catch their trains, preferred it. It had been a good day. Lunch-time had been warm and sunny, and many people had bought magazines to read outside with their sandwiches. Now it was cold and rainy, and people wanted an evening paper for a cheerless journey ahead and a dull evening indoors. At 6:30, with the main rush over, he started to collect the money together and count it. Then he left the stand and went home.

Given the question: Given the below context: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario can be categorized as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate, if the power station orders more coal to be delivered, there will be an increased demand for coal production and transportation. Consequently, the steps involved in the coal extraction and supply process must also be adjusted to accommodate this increase in demand. In this context, the actual steps of the process, which include excavating the mine, miners removing the coal, and transporting the coal to the surface, remain unchanged. However, the indirect impact of an increased coal order would potentially lead to adjustments in the efficiency, speed, or capacity of coal removal and transportation activities. For instance, the mine may employ additional miners or require them to work longer shifts in order to extract more coal from the mine. Additionally, there might be a need for more trucks or larger vehicles to transport the extra coal to the power station. Thus, the perturbation due to the increase in the power station's coal order doesn't directly change any specific step in the process but rather creates an indirect effect that influences the amount of coal loaded and the resources needed to accomplish the task.

Write the answer: On which of the Greek islands did Bacchus find Ariadne, according to legend?","completion":"According to ancient Greek myth, Bacchus, the god of wine and revelry, found Ariadne on the island of Naxos. To understand the story, we need to delve into the backgrounds of both characters and provide context on the events leading up to their encounter. Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and Queen Pasiphae. Her role in Greek mythology becomes significant during the tale of Theseus and the Minotaur. The Minotaur, a half-human, half-bull creature, was the progeny of Pasiphae and a bull, born as a result of King Minos' disobedience to the gods. To contain the Minotaur, King Minos ordered the construction of a labyrinth under his palace. Every seven years, Athens was forced to send seven young men and seven young women as a tribute to King Minos. Selected Athenians were to be placed in the labyrinth as a sacrifice to the Minotaur. However, the hero Theseus, son of King Aegeus of Athens, was determined to end this practice. He volunteered as one of the seven young men and traveled to Crete with the intention of killing the Minotaur. Upon his arrival, Ariadne fell in love with Theseus and decided to help him defeat the Minotaur. She provided him with a ball of thread, allowing him to retrace his steps and navigate through the labyrinth. With her assistance, Theseus was successful in his quest to slay the Minotaur and save the other Athenians. Eager to escape Crete together, Theseus and Ariadne set sail, with the intention of returning to Athens. However, they stopped to rest on the island of Naxos. Legend has it that Theseus either intentionally or accidentally left Ariadne behind on Naxos, depending on the version of the myth. Some accounts suggest that Athena, the goddess of wisdom, visited Theseus in a dream and instructed him to abandon Ariadne, while other versions propose that Theseus simply grew tired of her. Regardless of the reason, Ariadne found herself abandoned and heartbroken on the island of Naxos. It was here that the god Bacchus discovered her. Bacchus, known as Dionysus in Greek mythology, was the god of wine, agriculture, fertility, and revelry. Upon encountering Ariadne, he was smitten by her beauty and grace. The two fell in love, and together they celebrated with festivities and generous libations. Bacchus then took Ariadne as his wife. As a wedding gift, he presented her with a beautiful crown made of seven stars known as Corona Borealis. This constellation can still be seen in the night sky to this day. In conclusion, according to Greek legend, Bacchus found Ariadne on the island of Naxos after her abandonment by the Athenian hero Theseus. The tale of Ariadne's encounter with Bacchus speaks to the transformative power of love and the capacity for second chances in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: Fun quizzes and tests can be a great way to do something a little bit different in the classroom, while still learning and teaching. To make the whole exercise a success, it's important that you don't overlook the evaluation and debriefing at the end of the test. This helps the students to appreciate the purpose of the game and what they learned. You can start this by recapping some of the key points covered in test and writing them on the board. You might like to try grading the tests either in small groups or as a class. If you have done the quiz in small groups in class you can swap answers with another group, so that each team marks another team's test. If different groups have different answers to a question, you can use this as an opportunity to discuss it as a class. Discussing the question in detail with the different answer will enable you to help make sure that everyone understands which answer was correct and why. Encourage the group that got the question wrong to talk together to explain where they went wrong. This can operate as a kind of simple peer assessment, where students mark each other's work. This can be very positive, but you should make sure everyone stays friendly and nobody is singled out. If you are doing a fast-paced quiz in class, you can make grading part of the game. If you have given your students buzzers or bells to answer questions, you can write up the scores on the board and update them after each question. This will make it more like a quiz show. You could have a simple tally chart on the board, or you could have something more creative. Each correct score could reveal a letter or part of a picture that the teams have to uncover to win. It might be a fun test at the end of the term to revise some key material while letting off a bit of steam, or it could be a more serious test that counts towards the overall grade.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person David encouraged to write more songs for the band? Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period.

Choose your answer from: A. tube nucleus; B. pollen tube; C. cytoplasm; D. intine; Answer the following question given this paragraph: Each pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the intine (Figure 32.7). The exine contains sporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells. Sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage. Female Gametophyte (The Embryo Sac) While the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases. First, in the process of megasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploid megasporangium—an area of tissue in the ovules—undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase, megagametogenesis, the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei—the polar nuclei—move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid central cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells, which later degenerate. The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells (Figure 32.8). The synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. Once fertilization is complete, the resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed.

Article: Chinese officials yesterday urged employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries. Experts estimate that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said. He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers\` health.

The statement implies that the performance exceeded the writer's expectations, especially since they mentioned they were never a Heath Ledger fan initially. The writer's appreciation for Heath's Joker could be attributed to a number of factors such as the depth and complexity Ledger brought to the character, the powerful screen presence he had, or his ability to infuse the role with a unique blend of menace, humor, and intelligence. Furthermore, the writer may have felt that Ledger's performance elevated the film, making it more enjoyable and engaging even when they found some of the action scenes overly exaggerated or hard to follow. In summary, the writer likely praised Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, stating that he \\"knocked the character out of the park,\\" because he managed to turn the character into one of the movie's high points with his exceptional acting skills, strong screen presence, and a captivating interpretation of the role."},{"prompt":"Given the question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Vaccination schedule.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Q: Passage: Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.

Create a matrix of size (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1) and initialize all elements with 0. This will store the lengths of common substrings. 2. The first row and first column of the matrix will represent empty strings and will remain filled with 0. 3. Iterate through both strings A and B, comparing each character of A with each character of B one by one. 4. If there is a matching character, update the corresponding matrix element by adding 1 to the value of the diagonal element (top-left element) and store the maximum length and ending index of the longest common substring found so far. 5. If the characters do not match, set the matrix element value to 0. 6. After iterating through the entire strings A and B, using the maximum length and ending index, extract the longest common substring. Now, let's apply these steps to the given strings: A = \\"RIWqLkXZp\\" B = \\"iMqLkvc\\" 1. Initialize an empty matrix of size 10 x 8 (as len(A)=9 and len(B)=7) and fill all elements with 0. 2. Create variables maxLength (current maximum length of the common substring) and endIndex (ending index of the maxLength substring in A). 3. Iterate through both strings, comparing characters one by one. For better understanding, let's see the matrix after the comparisons: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4.

If the bleeding stopped quickly after the sneeze, then you can call your veterinary office, discuss the issue, and make an appointment to bring your dog in. If the bleeding has not stopped or took a long time to stop, then the dog should be taken to a veterinarian immediately, as the blood loss alone can be a threat to your dog's health. If your regular veterinary office is closed while your dog's nose is bleeding, then you should take your dog to an emergency pet hospital in your area. If your dog's nose stopped bleeding shortly after the sneeze, call the emergency pet hospital and discuss whether to bring the dog in or to wait until the dog's normal veterinary office is open. In order to get a diagnosis, your veterinarian will need to do a variety of tests on your dog. These tests, which may require several rounds of testing, will allow your vet to narrow in on the cause of the bleeding. Possible tests your vet will want to perform include: Blood cell count Urinalysis X-rays Rhinoscopy Blood pressure Cultures from nose Additional specialized testing There are a variety of things that could be causing your dog's nose to bleed. Once your veterinarian gives you a definitive diagnosis, they should also present you with a treatment plan. Your dog's bloody nose could have simply been caused by the force of your dog sneezing or by a foreign body in the nose. If this is the case your dog should easily recover on its own once any foreign bodies are removed. However, this may not be the case if there is an underlying problem with the dog's blood clotting ability. Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by a simple sinus infection. A sinus infection is usually treated with a round of antibiotics and can be cleared up quickly. Your dog's bloody nose could be caused by a tumor. Treatment for a malignant tumor usually includes surgery and chemotherapy, although these treatments can be difficult for tumors in the sinuses.

As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Choose your answer from: (i). yes (ii). it is not possible to tell (iii). no","completion":"Based on the provided premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The writing was extremely crass\\" is likely true. The phrase \\"Other no story line, cheap puns, and heavy-handed sexual innuendo\\" suggests that the writing in question lacked a coherent narrative structure and relied on lowbrow humor and overtly sexual content. These elements often contribute to a perception of crassness in a piece of writing. Crassness can be understood as a lack of refinement, subtlety, or sensitivity in expression. A crass work might be characterized by its appeal to the baser instincts of the audience, often relying on crude humor, excessive violence, or explicit sexual content to hold their attention. In the case of the premise provided, a lack of story line indicates poor narrative structure, and the emphasis on cheap puns and sexual innuendo suggests that the writing relied heavily on unrefined and tasteless humor. However, it is essential to consider the possibility that the explicit content and cheap humor could be deliberately employed as a form of satire, subversion, or parody of a specific genre or societal norms. In such cases, distinguishing between crassness and intended artistic choice might require additional context or a deeper analysis of the work as a whole.

Read the given story carefully and identify the main events related to the location of the object (green_pepper) and the characters' (James and Charlotte) actions and beliefs. 2. Identify the scenario that the story falls into: a) the individual's belief matches reality, b) the individual's belief does not match reality, or c) an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. 3. Single out the distractor sentences that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader. 4. Analyze the question to determine what it is asking about - in this case, it asks about James' thoughts on where Charlotte would search for the green_pepper. 5. Combine the information gathered in steps 2 and 4 using the story's context to provide an accurate answer. In this particular story: - James and Charlotte both enter the sunroom. - The green_pepper is initially in the green_treasure_chest. - Charlotte exits the sunroom. - James moves the green_pepper to the red_bucket. - James exits the sunroom. - Charlotte enters the sunroom again. The provided question is: \\"Where does James think that Charlotte searches for the green_pepper?\\" Following the story's events, the scenario is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. In this case, James might have a false belief about where Charlotte would search for the green_pepper. As Charlotte was not in the sunroom when James moved the green_pepper to the red_bucket, James would likely think that Charlotte still believes the green_pepper is in the green_treasure_chest.

Summarize this article: Iris Grace, who lives with her family in Leicestershire, began painting last year, and has already been praised by buyers, collectors and galleries for her work's intense colour, immediacy, and open composition. Her paintings are sold to private art collectors in the UK and around the world for thousands of pounds each, with all profits going towards art materials and therapy. Arabella Carter-Johnson, Iris’s mother, said that Iris loves being outside and that she can see “so much of nature in her paintings”. Iris with her cat Thula “She will watch water, trees, wind, leaves, flowers, birds, clouds… she is so interested in movement and how it changes things.” She added that Iris is “very musical” and has been since she was a baby. “It was the one thing that always calmed her,” she said. “Iris is particularly into classical music at the moment and knows all of the orchestra instruments. She adores the violin.” Iris’s cat Thula is another source of inspiration, and features regularly in her work, such as her painting ‘Raining Cats’. 'Raining Cats' by Iris Grace “There have been a lot of references to Monet because of the Impressionistic style. We have had many artists, dealers and galleries contact us who are very complimentary about her work which is lovely,” Iris's mother said. “For us though the joy that Iris gets from creating her pieces is the highlight, how it changes her mood, how happy it makes her.” Due to a lack of awareness, people with autism and their friends, family and carers often struggle to explain just how strong an impact it can have on a person’s life. Iris's mother said that her daughter had great success with play therapy, music therapy, and now a new form of speech therapy which uses video, created by a company called Gemiini. “By following Iris’s interests, her ‘spark’, I have been able to engage her in many things,’ Iris's mother said. \\"We have started our own activity club that supports children with autism, and run that every Saturday morning.\\" Iris at work Celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher have shared Iris’s work on social media, while three-time BAFTA award winner Olivia Colman showed her support by reading a poem for a video about Iris. Several high-profile figures are active in raising awareness of autism, including actor Daniel Radcliffe, who is a patron for the Autism Research Trust. “I am sure his [Ashton Kutcher’s] post has had a huge impact, said Iris's mother. \\"Our society now is so interested in what celebrities say or do that any comments from them will undoubtedly raise awareness.\\" You can learn more about Iris's work on her website ||||| When Iris Grace Halmshaw's parents introduced her to painting, they were hoping the activity would be a fun diversion and a way to get their autistic child to express herself. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest But as soon as Iris picked up a brush, her parents were blown away by how she approached the painting. She shied away from doing simple paintings of houses or smiling stick figures and, instead, created colorful abstract pieces that appeared to express deep emotion. “It was on her first painting I noticed a difference in her painting compared with how you would normally expect a child to paint,” Iris’ mom, Arabella Carter-Johnson, wrote to ABC News in an email. \\"She filled the page with colour but with thought and consideration. ... We didn't think [too] much of it at the time, we were just so happy to have found an activity that brought her so much joy.\\" British Toddler's Paintings Go Global See the Iris Grace Painting Selling for Thousands Mind-Bending Artist Turns Brainwaves to Art When her parents shared her artwork online, people started to contact them and ask to purchase prints. When the parents started to sell her work online, Iris' name and work grabbed headlines and high prices. Last summer, several of Iris’ paintings were sold individually for as much as 1,500 pounds and the pint-size painter has nearly 90,000 likes on Facebook. But as Iris’ work grabbed the spotlight, the family also focused on protecting her and keeping her day-to-day life stable. “We are trying to keep our lives as normal as possible for Iris, so our same routine continues,” wrote Carter-Johnson. \\"I am educating her at home and this week we have been concentrating on animals, so nothing has changed in Iris's world.\\" Courtesy Arabella Carter-Johnson While Iris’ parents say her autism likely helped her to create incredible artwork, it can also make her anxious around new people and she had trouble speaking until recently. While her art has been a way to express herself, her parents are careful not to overwhelm the 5-year-old. “She has a fantastic concentration span but as her parent and educator I have to keep an eye on that and help her move onto other things,” said Carter-Johnson. “I can see nature in her paintings, water, trees, flowers, and also we can see Thula her cat in many of them.” Courtesy Arabella Carter-Johnson The family decided to sell Iris’ paintings both as a way to fund her private therapists and to raise awareness about her condition. According to the family, all the profits from Iris’ work will go to pay for her art materials and her ongoing private therapists. The money also goes to a savings account for Iris and to fund a club for autistic children run out of the Halmshaw home called the Little Explorers Activity Club. After Iris was introduced to art, Carter-Johnson said, her daughter can now express herself in other ways besides speech or words. Iris’ mother said Iris can get lost in her work and spend as long as two hours painting her abstract pieces. “She has an understanding of colours and how they interact with each other,” wrote Iris’ parents on a website dedicated to her work. “She beams with excitement and joy when I get out the paints, it lifts her mood everytime.” |||||","completion":"Iris Grace is a young girl who started painting last year and has become very popular for her beautiful artwork.

All polar compounds contain polar bonds (although not all compounds that contain polar bonds are polar. ) In a polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally. One atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge. The other atom attracts the shared electrons less strongly, so it is has a partial positive charge. In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia? is inside the article: Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony..., can you guess it ?","completion":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival and sparked interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia is Symphony No. 5, Op. 50 (1921-1922).

Build a movie plot around this: What food does Jack order in English? Grilled cheese","completion":"Title: Cheese Chronicles Genre: Comedy-Drama Step 1: Introduce the protagonist and the setting Jack Fenton, a talented yet shy young Englishman, is a passionate food blogger who dreams of writing about his culinary adventures. He lives in Manchester, England, and has become a local food celebrity, known for his honest and sometimes comically scathing reviews. Step 2: Introduce the conflict Jack is struggling to find a suitable challenge for his milestone 1000th food blog post. Frustration leads to a writer's block, and the pressure from his fans is mounting. Step 3: The plot begins to develop Jack's best friend, Sarah, suggests a road trip through the English countryside to clear his mind and discover new culinary delights. Jack reluctantly agrees, hoping it will solve his writer's block and provide material for his milestone blog post. Step 4: Portray different adventures and encounters On their journey, Jack and Sarah explore various quirky artisan restaurants, whose chefs proudly prepare meals using traditional British ingredients. Among these food encounters, one left a lasting impression: The English grilled cheese sandwich. Jack immediately connected with the taste and felt that this sandwich represents the essence of British comfort food. Step 5: Introduce a subplot Jack's love for the English grilled cheese sandwich inadvertently creates conflict with the French proprietor, Pierre, of a newly opened restaurant in town that claims to serve the perfect Croque Monsieur. This disagreement represents the historic conflict between English and French culinary traditions. Step 6: Climax In an effort to prove the superiority of the English grilled cheese, Jack challenges Pierre to a sandwich showdown. The contest attracts the attention of food lovers from across the country, media engagement, and local culinary critics. Jack believes a win will quash the dispute and also provide a memorable story for his milestone 1000th blog post. Step 7: Resolution and character growth The showdown is a hard-fought battle, but the result of the competition leads to a tie. Both Pierre and Jack realize that the two sandwiches, though rooted in different cultures, are equally loved and celebrated. They learn to appreciate the diversity that their respective food cultures bring and become friends. Step 8: Conclusion Jack writes his 1000th blog post, exploring the importance of finding common ground, appreciating differences, and celebrating food's power to bring people together. Ultimately, he has not only found the story for his milestone post but also discovered his own voice as a writer and the importance of personal growth through food adventures. The movie will balance elements of comedy and drama while providing a heartwarming exploration of friendship, food discoveries, personal growth, and the power of food to unite people from different cultural backgrounds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We want to find the number \\"a\\" that makes both sides equal. The equation is: -17822*a - 17818*a = -35598*a - 3234 2. We can make the equation simpler by adding the \\"a\\" parts on the left side. So, we'll add -17822*a and -17818*a: (-17822 - 17818)*a = -35598*a - 3234 Now, our equation looks like this: -35640*a = -35598*a - 3234 3. We need to get all the \\"a\\" parts on one side and all the numbers without \\"a\\" on the other side. Let's add 35598*a to both sides of the equation to move it to the left: (-35640 + 35598)*a = -3234 Now, our equation looks like this: -42*a = -3234 4. To find the number \\"a,\\" we need to divide both sides of the equation by -42: a = -3234 / -42 5. When we do the division, we get: a = 77 So, the solution to the equation is a = 77.

(The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant \\"Y\\" that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus.) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer. Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land from Provo called \\"Temple Hill\\". After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial. Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a \\"religious seminary\\".

This disorder arises when defective valves allow blood to accumulate within the veins, causing them to distend, twist, and become visible on the surface of the integument. Varicose veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in women and are often related to pregnancy. More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful and sometimes itchy or throbbing. Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support hose, as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition.

Red giants form when a star exhausts its hydrogen supply in its core. The core begins to contract, heat up, and start burning hydrogen in a shell around the core. The outer layers of the star expand, and that's how the star becomes a red giant. So, let's break this down: - Vader is a red giant, which means its core is no longer burning hydrogen. - Enterprise is not a red giant, so we can infer that its core is still burning hydrogen.

Instead, they type on computers. But scientists say that method is less helpful. If you need to remember something, write it. Writing notes by hand is much better for long-term memory of idea. So, turn off your computer if you want to remember something. Students who type notes on a keyboard often write down what the teacher says word-for-word. They may write without really thinking about what they are writing. These electronic notes contained more words. But scientists say it leads to \\" _ .\\" Transcription means to write down something exactly as you hear it. However, students taking notes by writing them, need to first process the information they hear. Then they record just the main parts. They use fewer words. This is because people usually write slower than they type. This kind of process leads to a deeper understanding. The scientists did a research. In the research, students listened to a teacher and then took a test. Some took notes by typing on a computer. The others took notes by writing them down. Both groups performed about the same in remembering facts. But students who typed their notes did much worse on conceptual questions. These questions required them to understand an idea. Also, scientists found that those who wrote their notes remembered conceptual information better a week later. Scientists believe that the students who took notes by writing them had a deeper understanding of ideas. Scientists know that students probably will still use their computers in class. But they suggest to take notes by hand on screens. They say this might be a good way between different schools.

Summarize this article: Extracts from the \\"missing\\" correspondence are published in the journal Nature. Maurice Wilkins, James Watson and Francis Crick won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the DNA-related work. But many others contributed, including Rosalind Franklin - whose efforts were called \\"witchcraft\\" in one letter. All three Nobel Prizewinners worked in molecular biology, but in different labs. Essentially, there were two main groups, pursuing the discovery of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) structure: Dr Wilkins and Dr Franklin at King's College in London, and Dr Watson and Dr Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. Besides strained relationships, the letters and postcards also give insights into the personalities of the key players. The Cambridge team used some of Dr Franklin's results to build their first DNA model in December 1951. This triple-helix model was wrong, and the scientists were barred from doing any further DNA work. Dr Wilkins then wrote to his colleagues: \\"This is to say how bloody browned off I am entirely, and how rotten I feel about it all, and how entirely friendly I am (though it may appear differently). \\"We are really between forces which may grind all of us into little piecesâ€¦\\" But Dr Crick and Dr Watson appeared to be rather breezy: \\"â€¦cheer up, and take it from us that even if we kicked you in the pants, it was between friends,\\" the pair wrote in response. \\"We hope our little burglary will at least produce a united front in your group!\\" The last phrase referred to strained relations between Dr Wilkins and Dr Franklin. When the latter arrived to King's College, her colleague thought that she would be working for him, but she believed otherwise. This misunderstanding poisoned their relationship, and the tensions were highlighted even further in other letters. Just before Dr Franklin was to leave King's College, Dr Wilkins wrote to the Cambridge scientists that \\"the smoke of witchcraft will soon be getting out of our eyes\\". Explaining the situation to BBC News, Nature's commissioning editor Sara Abdullah said it added to \\"the canon of awful things said about [Dr Franklin]\\". \\"I think 'sexist' is what we are groping around for. \\"Obviously, this is a different time, it's 1953. There was personal tension; she was very unusual in being a leading woman in science at that time. \\"And there were these different styles of working - all these things are captured there, in those few words.\\" In early 1953, Maurice Wilkins showed James Watson the famous \\"Photograph 51\\". It was the crucial X-ray image of DNA made by Dr Franklin in the previous months, and it helped the two Cambridge biologists to develop the historic - and correct - double-helix model. \\"To think that Rosie had all the 3D data for nine months and wouldn't fit a helix to it, and there was I taking her word for it that the data was anti-helical,\\" wrote Dr Wilkins to Dr Crick. \\"Christ.\\" And when the study was published in Nature in April 1953, there were only vague references to Dr Franklin's contribution to the titanic achievement in molecular biology. The correspondence had been thought lost. But it was found earlier this year by Alexander Gann and Jan Witkowski of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York among papers that had belonged to another scientist, Sydney Brenner, who had shared an office with Francis Crick in Cambridge.","completion":"This article discusses newly discovered correspondence between Maurice Wilkins, James Watson, and Francis Crick, the 1962 Nobel Prize winners in Medicine for their work on DNA.

Whiteside said teammates Michael Beasley, Luol Deng and Udonis Haslem have been especially helpful with their words of encouragement and their advice as of late. \\"He's still a family member,\\" said head coach Erik Spoelstra, who didn't rule a team fine or suspension if the NBA had not acted on the matter. \\"It's another learning opportunity. We're going to correct it with him. He wants to, he knows we need him.\\" Whiteside said he personally reached out to Celtics center Kelly Olynyk to say he was sorry for the blindside hit that was called a flagrant 2 foul and earned him an immediate ejection. The Heat would go on to lose the game, which was critical for their playoff hopes. \\"Just because it was such a far journey and I feel like I took some steps back and I'm better than that,\\" he said of why he was so contrite. \\"I regret it a lot. \\"I'm starting to realize I'm a bigger name in the NBA then what I was so it's still a learning experience for me. I'm talking to the veteran guys and I'm talking to Alonzo (Mourning). It's just a process.” While he still maintains he is getting fouled hard in the paint and isn't getting enough calls, he recognizes his actions are unacceptable no matter the circumstances. \\"It's frustrating when somebody is hitting you in the face and you want to just come back and do the best you can and they keep you from it,\\" said Whiteside. \\"It gets frustrating at times but I’ve got to do better keeping calm and keeping a level head because if I get ejected, it hurts everyone.\\" Dwyane Wade had some tough words for his teammate after the game, but has repeatedly stressed the fact that Whiteside has not been a problem with the team on or off the court since his arrival midway through the season. Having played alongside dominant centers such as Shaquille O'Neal and Mourning in his career, he knows that opposing teams will stop short of nothing to try to get in their heads. \\"He just has to understand it's going to happen,\\" Wade said. \\"Big guys that are dominant and that are aggressive in their own right and like to dunk on people, they’re going to get fouled hard. There’s going to be a lot of stuff that he's going to have to overcome. He's a genuine guy, he's a nice guy. So he's just got to understand that and he's still young. He's learning it in front of everyone's eyes.\\" Though he claims these are the first ejections ever in his basketball career, he assured the large media group assembled around him that he has learned his lesson and does not want to harm his team going forward because of his attitude. \\"It happened, there's really nothing I can do about it,\\" he said. \\"You can dwell on it or you can move on from it and just show people that you're not that kind of guy. I’ll use this as a learning point.\\" You can follow Surya Fernandez on Twitter @SuryaHeatNBA or email him at SuryaFoxSports@gmail.com. Summary:","completion":"Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside was suspended for one game without pay by the NBA following his ejection during a game against the Boston Celtics. Whiteside expressed remorse for his actions, stating that he let his teammates down and that it cannot happen again. He has been ejected twice in his last four games and has already accumulated 40,000 in fines this season.

Question: Stella Artois originates from which Belgian city, the name being shown on its bottles and cans? Answer:","completion":"Stella Artois, a popular and widely recognized beer brand, originally hails from the Belgian city of Leuven. The name of this city is prominently displayed on the bottles and cans of Stella Artois, proudly linking the brand to its historical roots and the brewing tradition for which the city is renowned. Leuven, the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flanders region of Belgium, boasts a long and rich history of beer production. The city is known for being home to some of the oldest and most prestigious breweries that have played a significant role in shaping the global beer industry. Stella Artois was first created in 1926 as a Christmas beer by Brouwerij Artois, a brewery that traces its origins back to 1366 when it was known as Den Horen Brewery. The name \\"Stella\\" means \\"star\\" in Latin, signifying the festive spirit in which the beer was launched. Stella Artois has since grown to become a leading global beer brand, enjoyed by millions of people around the world. The brewery itself merged with Interbrew, creating the largest brewing company in the world at the time. Later, Interbrew merged with the Brazilian brewery AmBev to form InBev, which ultimately acquired Anheuser-Busch, making the combined company Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev). Despite its growth and the various mergers under which the brand has operated, Stella Artois has managed to retain its identity and heritage, staying true to the values of its Belgian roots. The brewing process of Stella Artois has remained relatively unchanged since its creation. The beer is brewed using the finest natural ingredients, such as Belgian malted barley, selected Saaz hops from the Czech Republic, and pure water. The use of maize and the distinctive Stella Artois yeast strain contribute to the beer's unique flavor profile and its refreshing quality. The brewing process is carefully overseen by skilled brewmasters who have honed their craft over many years. The brand's strong association with Leuven has also contributed to the city's reputation as a beer destination. Beer enthusiasts and tourists alike flock to Leuven to explore its vibrant beer culture, visit notable breweries, and participate in beer-related events that showcase the city's brewing prowess. In this regard, Stella Artois serves as both a symbol and an ambassador of the rich brewing tradition of Leuven and the Belgian beer culture more broadly. In conclusion, Stella Artois is a world-famous beer brand that originates from the Belgian city of Leuven. This fact is proudly displayed on its bottles and cans, symbolizing the deep and enduring connection between the beer and its birthplace. Over the years, Stella Artois has grown in popularity and reach, but its home city, Leuven, remains an integral part of its identity and its commitment to preserving the time-honored traditions of Belgian beer craftsmanship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What mythical creature is a symbol of Wales????","completion":"The mythical creature that serves as a symbol of Wales is the dragon, specifically, the red dragon known as \\"Y Ddraig Goch\\" in Welsh. This legendary creature has a long association with the country's history, culture, and folklore, dating back to ancient times. According to legend, the red dragon prevailed in a battle against an invading white dragon, ultimately representing the success of the native Welsh people against various efforts to conquer their land, particularly the Anglo-Saxons and the Saxons. The story was later incorporated into the Arthurian legends, where Merlin is said to have prophesized about the victory of the red dragon representing a future king of Britain. The origin of the Welsh dragon traces its roots to Celtic mythology and symbolism, where dragons were often seen as symbols of power, wisdom, and sovereignty. The Celtic people highly regarded these mythical creatures, and as such, the red dragon subsequently became an emblem of the Celtic tribes' collective power and unity. When the Romans conquered Britain, they adopted the dragon symbolism, incorporating it into their military standards. It is believed that the red dragon was included in the battle standards of Roman soldiers stationed in Wales. Over time, the Welsh people identified with and adopted the red dragon as their own national symbol. In the early medieval period, the use of the red dragon emblem gained prominence among the Welsh royalty, particularly in the 800s under the reign of Cadwaladr, king of Gwynedd. It is said that Cadwaladr had a dragon flag adorned with Y Ddraig Goch. Many centuries later, during the reign of King Henry VII, the dragon became an important symbol of Welsh identity and resistance. After leading the Welsh forces in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Henry VII integrated the red dragon into the Tudor royal standard, displaying the creature alongside a green and white field - the colors of the House of Tudor. In 1959, the red dragon was officially recognized as the national flag of Wales. The flag features a bold red dragon set against a green and white background. Today, the red dragon symbolizes the spirit of the Welsh people, and it is used across numerous aspects of Welsh culture, from sports to tourism, politics, and celebrations. In conclusion, the red dragon, Y Ddraig Goch, is a potent emblem of Welsh identity, reflecting the nation's rich history, Celtic heritage, and resilient spirit. This mythical creature is deeply ingrained in the folklore and traditions of Wales, standing proudly as a symbol of strength, perseverance, and unity for the country and its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The problem gives you a multiple-choice question and requires you to classify the answer into one of the given options ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'). Here are the simple steps to solve the problem: Step 1: Analyze the problem You are given that: - The jogger is running at 9 km/hr - The jogger is 240 meters ahead of the train - The train is 100 meters long and running at 45 km/hr - Both are moving in the same direction Step 2: Convert speeds and distances into the same units - To make our calculations easier, let's convert both speeds to meters per second (m/s). - 1 km/hr = (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 5/18 m/s - Speed of jogger = 9 km/hr * 5/18 = 45 / 18 = 2.5 m/s - Speed of train = 45 km/hr * 5/18 = 225 / 18 = 12.5 m/s Step 3: Calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed. - Relative speed = 12.5 m/s - 2.5 m/s = 10 m/s Step 4: Calculate the distance the train needs to cover to pass the jogger To fully pass the jogger, the train must cover the distance consisting of the 240 meters initially between them and the full length of the train (100 meters). - Total distance = 240 m + 100 m = 340 m Step 5: Calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the jogger We can find the time by dividing the total distance by the relative speed. - Time = Total distance / Relative speed = 340 m / 10 m/s = 34 seconds Step 6: Identify the correct option The answer is 34 seconds, which corresponds to option 'c'.

The researchers note that support groups are already an effective tool in dealing with other socially influenced problems, like alcoholism . The findings appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers used information collected from 12,000 people. It was collected between 1972 and 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The information was highly detailed. There was even contact information for close friends of the people in the study. The researchers examined more than 40,000 social ties. They found a person's chances of becoming severely overweight increased by 50% if a friend had become obese. A sister or brother of a person who became obese had a 40% increased chance of becoming obese. The risk for a wife or husband was a little less than that. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School was a lead researcher in the study. He says there is a direct causal relationship between a person getting fat and being followed in weight gain by a friend. The study found that the sex of the friends was also an influence. In same-sex friendship, a person had a 71% increased risk of becoming obese. Men had a 44% increased risk of becoming obese after weight gain in a brother. In sisters, it was 67%. The researchers also considered the effect of where people lived in relation to each other. James Fowler of the University of California was the other lead expert. He says a friend who lives a few hundred kilometers away has as much influence as one in the same neighborhood. He says the study demonstrates the need to consider that a major part of people's health is tied to their social connections. Both researchers say their research shows that obesity is not just a private medical issue, but also a... Question: Which of the following statements would Nicholas Christakis agree to?

Rowling continued defending her Harry Potter play, celebrity couple John Legend and Chrissy Teigen took a bite out of Pierce Morgan and Hillary Clinton too took a shot at one of the most notorious trolls of all. While there were no surprises when Republican nominee Donald Trump called out President Obama for supporting fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, it was Clinton’s response that nearly caused a Twitter singularity from its reactions. In three short words, Clinton’s reply of “Delete your account” has amassed over 400,000 retweets and nearly 500,000 likes. Following boxing legend Muhammad Ali’s death, many celebrated Ali’s contributions to the sport and his activism on Twitter, inspired by his Muslim faith. Civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis tweeted an old photo of Ali encouraging everyone to get the vote out, with the fitting tagline “It’s your fight.” The only truth here is that a relationship came to an end & what remains is a huge amount of love and respect — Calvin Harris (@CalvinHarris) June 2, 2016 After a breakup between musicians Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris which went unavoidably public, Harris took to Twitter to explain that it had ended in a respectful and thankfully non-hostile way. To presumably show she agreed, Swift retweeted. In the fallout of the trial for Brock Turner, who received only six months in jail for sexual assault, Journalist Lauren Duca posted a screenshot of the letter Turner’s father had written as an example of deep-seated rape culture. Namely, the letter glossed over the rape as “20 minutes of action” and lamented that Turner no longer enjoys steaks. User Leonardo Semma, who’d just graduated from high school threw back to what he called his greatest high school achievement: getting suspended for calling out his school’s superintendent on Twitter. Tweeting the superintendent to “get his ass out here” to clear some snow from the parking lots, he not only received a suspension, but the superintendent blocked him on Twitter. Harry Potter author and Twitter celebrity in her own right, J.K. Rowling, has been steadily promoting the Potter expanded universe play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. This has included defending the casting of black actress Noma Dumezweni as Hermione Granger, and she’s shut down several complaints that a white actress should have been cast instead. TV personality and noted troll Piers Morgan received some insults of his own after requesting people not sugercoat his life, musician John Legend pleasantly suggested Morgan test that out for himself (although Legend just said to retire from his job, not die). His wife, model Chrissy Teigen, added an extra layer of shade and said that being a troll isn’t really an actual job you can retire from. For National Gun Violence Awareness Day, comedian Amy Schumer celebrated the #WearOrange campaign by wearing just an orange sports bra.

Alec The answer is:","completion":"Alec was the name of the jockey riding the horse named Black. Step 1: Develop the main characters Our story revolves around Alec, a talented but underestimated young jockey, and Black, a magnificent and mysterious black racehorse. Both characters have their unique qualities: Alec has a natural connection with horses, while Black seems to have an untamed energy and remarkable speed. Step 2: Establish the setting The movie is set in the world of horse racing, with most events occurring at an old racetrack, as well as at stables, on training grounds, and in different towns where competitions take place. Step 3: Build the movie plot In the beginning, we introduce Alec and his dream of becoming a champion jockey. He gets a job at a local stable owned by a retired jockey, who becomes Alec's mentor and helps him develop his skills. One day, a mysterious man arrives at the stable to sell Black, a horse he can no longer keep due to financial issues. Alec connects with Black from the moment they meet and convinces his mentor to buy the horse, believing they have a chance to win races together. Alec and Black begin training. The horse has an incredible raw talent and speed that they refine over time. As they practice together, they form an unbreakable bond, becoming inseparable both on and off the racetrack. The duo begins to participate in horse races, surprising everyone with their talent and success. However, they face challenges: other jockeys and trainers feel threatened by Alec and Black's abilities and attempt to sabotage their growth with underhanded tactics. Throughout the story, we learn more about the mysterious man who sold Black and why the horse was so important to him. His daughter was a promising young jockey who tragically died in a racing accident while riding Black. The man blamed himself and the horse for her death, leading to his decision to sell the horse. Despite the odds stacked against them, Alec and Black ultimately make it to a prestigious racing event where they have the chance to prove themselves. In the movie's climax, they face off against their biggest rivals in the most important race of their lives. In the final race, Alec and Black manage to overcome all challenges, including betrayal and sabotage, and win the race in a thrilling photo finish. Their victory proves that talent and hard work, combined with a genuine connection between rider and horse, can overcome any obstacles. Step 4: Close the story The movie ends with Alec and Black becoming legendary figures in the horse racing world. The mysterious man who sold Black comes to terms with his past, having seen Alec help the horse reach its true potential. Alec's persistence and dedication to his dream inspires others to believe in themselves and work towards their goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is possible to start finding pathways to letting others help you. One of the best ways of doing this is to follow your first mind. The minute you have a conscious thought that you are facing something you cannot alone handle, seek out help. Don't take the time to talk yourself out of it. Remember to make a note of the solution you receive for your problem. This will help you when you face a similar situation again When the thought crosses your mind that you could do with help sorting out a problem - carrying a heavy box, making dinner, working out a work dilemma, etc. - act on it. Decide who you will ask, phrase the request in your head, and go and ask for help. If another person is being kind in offering help, accepting it at face value is the first step. Yes, there are people with bad intentions, but there are also those who want to do good by others. Look for those people in the world and stop focusing on the negative. Seek out the goodness in others and restore your faith in humanity. An easy way to do this is by volunteering. Watching others give of themselves selflessly to assist those who are less fortunate is a terrific way to recognize the good in people. Volunteering also helps you to notice how people depend on one another within a community, and how all parts must work together to function as a whole. Choose wisely and carefully. Avoid people who make you feel like a lesser person in any way. Find people you really trust to try out asking for help first. This will allow you to open up bit by bit, and not be exposed to someone who might not do the right thing by you, or who might purposely make you feel weak for asking. In order to get, you need to give. If you keep cutting yourself off from opening up to others, you risk not sharing your skills, talents, and abilities with others in need of help. In helping another person, you cease to focus on yourself. And when you cease to focus on yourself, it is far easier to accept support back from another. In giving of yourself (your time, your listening ear, your love, your care, etc.), you are helping another learn more about you, be able to care for you, and believe that you will reciprocate the attention that they bestow upon you. Beyond receiving anything in return, giving also promotes cooperation, strengthens bonds, boosts feelings of gratitude, and is just downright good for your health. . In order to receive help, you need to trust the other person and to trust that you're worthy of help (self-respect). This might be the hardest part but it is absolutely vital. Wholesome, accepting, self-assured trust is capable of absorbing rejection, attracting genuine help, and will easily detect the occasional exploitative person. Choosing to trust requires that you: modify your expectations - remember that people are only human and they have both good and bad traits (so do you!) recognize that disappointment, fear, abandonment, and rejection are possible in all relationships find yourself worthy and capable of making wise decisions and being around decent people It can be all too easy to dismiss the worth or depth of your own problems.There is no hierarchy of problems, or scale of emotional pain. A problem is a problem, whatever its ease or difficulty. The litmus test is how much it is impacting you negatively and preventing you from moving forward. Belittling your problem as not worthy of being solved only serves to make it even more challenging to cope with. of the problems that no one can fix. There lies the greatest strength of all as there is a big difference between \\"burying\\" problems in comparison to accepting, forgiving and letting them go.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease. I am facing a new situation today: Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide? Answer:","completion":"Based on the principle of chemical equilibrium and the knowledge acquired from the background article, we can analyze Jennifer's and Justin's reactions. In the reaction that Jennifer and Justin are performing, hydrogen gas and glucose are the reactants, and carbon dioxide and oxygen gas are the products. The reaction can be represented as: H2 (g) + glucose (s) ⇌ CO2 (g) + O2 (g) Now, let's consider the changes made by Jennifer and Justin individually: 1. Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture. When the concentration of glucose decreases, the system will respond by favoring the forward reaction that replaces the glucose. Therefore, the reaction will proceed in the direction of producing more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. In this case, Jennifer's reaction will start producing more carbon dioxide. 2. Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. When the concentration of carbon dioxide decreases, the system will respond by favoring the reverse reaction, in which hydrogen gas and glucose react to form more carbon dioxide. Therefore, Justin's reaction will also start producing more carbon dioxide, since the reaction is compensating for the loss of carbon dioxide by favoring the formation of more products. In conclusion, both Jennifer's reaction and Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide after they remove glucose and carbon dioxide, respectively. This observation is based on the principle of chemical equilibrium, which dictates that when the concentration of a substance within a reaction system is changed, the reaction will adjust accordingly to reestablish equilibrium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A genetics lab at Columbia University Answer:","completion":"Title: The Spider's Awakening Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-fi Plot: Act 1: The movie begins with Peter Parker, a smart yet socially awkward high school student in New York City, busy with his life as a teenager, including his crush on his classmate, Mary Jane Watson. He is also trying to find his way through the maze that is high school but faces constant bullying from his classmates led by Flash Thompson. During this time, a world-renowned scientist, Dr. Celeste Warren, returns to her alma mater, Columbia University, to continue her groundbreaking research on genetics and pioneering new projects in genetic engineering. Dr. Warren has been studying DNA structures of various species with the aim of harnessing their unique abilities to address human physical limitations and diseases. Peter's biology class at Midtown High School is signed up for a field trip to Dr. Warren's cutting-edge genetics lab at Columbia University. Seeing this as an opportunity to escape his mundane life for a day and further explore his passion for science, Peter is incredibly excited. Act 2: As the field trip commences, Peter’s interest and excitement reach their peak when Dr. Warren presents a new project on synthesizing the genetic materials of various spiders to create a genetically-altered super-spider. She explains the possible benefits of this project, such as developing an advanced understanding of genetic engineering to battle degenerative diseases and potentially improving human physical capabilities. During the tour, Peter gets separated from his classmates, when he stumbles upon a restricted area within the lab, where Dr. Warren has kept the genetically-altered super-spider for further observation. Curiosity gets the better of him and Peter ventures in to take a closer look. In a twist of fate, the super-spider escapes its containment and bites Peter on his hand before scurrying off to the ventilation system. Peter initially feels a sudden surge of pain from the bite but manages to hide the incident from his classmates and teachers. As the day ends and Peter returns home, he starts to notice subtle changes in his body and senses, like an increased agility, strength and his ability to cling to surfaces. Act 3: During the course of the next few days, Peter gradually discovers the extent of his newfound abilities and the changes brought on by the spider bite. He also realizes that, like his late Uncle Ben told him, \\"with great power comes great responsibility.\\" He decides to keep his newfound powers a secret but uses them to help people in need and prevent small-scale crimes. As Peter becomes more adept in his new role as a friendly neighborhood vigilante, he discovers that Dr. Warren's lab funding was coming from a mysterious corporation with a hidden agenda. They have been secretly funding genetic engineering projects to create bio-weapons for military and political purposes. The corporation has been tracking Peter ever since the incident at the lab, knowing that he has gained enhanced abilities due to the spider bite and could be crucial to their bio-weapon development plan. Act 4: As Peter struggles to balance his responsibilities as a student, a son, a friend, and a hero, his life is put even more at risk when he uncovers the full scope of the mysterious corporation's intentions. They have kidnapped Dr. Warren and are forcing her to create human-animal hybrid experiments, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for humanity. Determined to save Dr. Warren and put an end to the corporation's sinister plans, Peter takes on the responsibility of stopping them while also juggling his increasingly complicated personal life and revealing his feelings to Mary Jane. In a thrilling final showdown, Peter, now embracing the superhero persona of \\"Spider-Man,\\" manages to stop the corporation and rescue Dr. Warren, who then destroys her research in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands again. Epilogue: Grateful and inspired by Peter's selflessness, Dr. Warren decides to dedicate her life to using genetics for the betterment of mankind, and with a newfound purpose, vows to protect and support Spider-Man in his future endeavors. Peter, despite learning that being a hero is not without its price, embraces his dual life as both an ordinary high-schooler and the extraordinary crime-fighting Spider-Man. The movie ends on a hopeful note, with Peter and Mary Jane finally professing their love for each other, and Dr. Warren warning Peter that he will face even greater challenges in the days to come, setting the stage for thrilling adventures in future sequels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Humans have been keeping animals as pets for tens of thousands of years, but Dr Jean-Loup Rault, an animal scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, believes new companions are coming: robot pets. \\"Technology is moving very fast,\\" Rault told ABC News, \\"The Tamagotchi in the early 1990s was really the first robotic pet, and now Sony and other big companies have improved them a lot.\\" This may not _ pet lovers. After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do. But for our next generation who are in constant touch with smart technology, a future in which lovely pets needn't have a heartbeat might not be a far-fetched dream. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

Rault highlights various advantages of robotic pets such as not requiring food, walks, or cleaning up messes, and being suitable for people with allergies, limited space, or a fear of real animals. Studies suggest that humans are capable of forming bonds with these intelligent machines, as evidenced by individuals giving names to their cars and children creating life stories for their toy animals. However, there are concerns regarding the potential impact of robotic pets on human attitudes toward living animals and their welfare, as well as the possibility of a generational transition in which traditional pets could be replaced by their robotic counterparts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (nee Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief. While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the college humor magazine. To continue work on the Jack-O-Lantern without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name \\"Seuss\\". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his \\"big inspiration for writing\\" at Dartmouth. Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a PhD in English literature. At Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career.","completion":"This text is about Theodor Seuss Geisel, an American author, political cartoonist, poet, animator, book publisher, and artist, best known for authoring more than 60 children's books under the pen name Doctor Seuss (abbreviated Dr. Seuss)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species or in an individual organism and for a test that detects this complement or measures the number. Is this statement correct \\"does a karyotype tell all of a person's genetic characteristics\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"does a karyotype tell all of a person's genetic characteristics?\\" is not entirely correct. While a karyotype does provide an overview of an individual's genetic makeup, it doesn't cover all aspects of a person's genetic characteristics. To understand why this is the case, it's important to understand what exactly a karyotype reveals. The primary function of karyotyping is to examine the number, size, and shape of an individual's chromosomes. In humans, a normal karyotype consists of 22 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes, making a total of 46 chromosomes. When analyzed, a karyotype can help to identify genetic disorders that are associated with having an additional chromosome (such as Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21) or missing one (such as Turner syndrome, which occurs in females when a sexual chromosome is missing), or alterations in the structure of a chromosome. However, even though karyotyping can identify these broad, chromosomal-level genetic disorders, it lacks the granularity to identify smaller scale genetic variations, or so-called point mutations. For example, it won't typically detect genetic disorders that are caused by a mutation in a single gene (like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia), nor will it identify less drastic forms of chromosomal abnormalities, like small insertions, deletions, or inversions of the genetic material. What's more, besides genetic mutations that directly lead to disease, there's a whole other category of genetic characteristics that a karyotype can't identify, namely those that contribute to the huge range of normal human variation we see in traits like height, eye color, skin pigmentation, and others. These traits are usually polygenic, i.e., affected by many genes working together, and are often influenced by the environment as well. Similarly, a karyotype won't identify the epigenetic modifications -- changes to the DNA molecule that don't alter the sequence of genes, but can still impact gene expression. Therefore, while a karyotype does provide a considerable amount of information regarding an individual's genetic makeup, it certainly doesn't tell all of a person's genetic characteristics. For a more comprehensive analysis of an individual's genome, techniques like whole-genome sequencing or exome sequencing would be more appropriate as they allow for the direct examination of an individual's specific DNA sequence, thereby enabling the detection of single-gene disorders and other genetic variations at a much higher resolution than karyotyping can provide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By asking Calder what he's doing there, I hope to shed light on the reason for the conflict and possibly find an amicable resolution. Step 3: Maintain a calm and neutral tone In order to avoid escalating the situation, I make sure my voice remains steady and non-aggressive. This demonstrates that I am not choosing sides or adding fuel to the fire, but am instead attempting to mediate the situation.

General Morton orders the patrons and staff killed and buried in a mass grave, and condemns the resort; the criminal's remains are delivered to him and his right-hand men, Tracey (Bruno Mattei) and Cheney (Claudio Fragasso), and burned.

So, we have this equation: -58 * k - 147 = -79 * k Now, imagine you have -58 apples in a basket and you multiply the apples by \\"k\\". Then you also have 147 marbles. And on the other side, you have -79 apples that you multiply by \\"k\\". We need to see how many times we need to multiply the apples to make the both sides equal. First, let's move the apples in the second part (-79 * k) to the first part (-58 * k). To do this, we'll add 79 * k to both sides: (-58 * k + 79 * k) - 147 = -79 * k + 79 * k This simplifies to: 21 * k - 147 = 0 Now, we want to find out the number of marbles (147) needed to make both sides equal. So, let's add 147 to each side: 21 * k - 147 + 147 = 0 + 147 This simplifies to: 21 * k = 147 Now, we need to find out how many times we need to multiply the apples (21) to get 147 marbles. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 21: (21 * k) / 21 = 147 / 21 This simplifies to: k = 7 So, the value of \\"k\\" is 7!

However, all efforts to improve the quality of education are doomed to fail if the system itself is not examined and understood to be the most significant impediment. After over six years in the making, THE WAR ON KIDS reveals that the problems with public education ultimately stem from the institution itself. Astonishingly all efforts at reform consistently avoid even considering this to be a possibility and the future for children and American democracy are at stake.In 95 minutes, THE WAR ON KIDS exposes the many ways the public school system has failed children and our future by robbing students of all freedoms due largely to irrational fears. Children are subjected to endure prison-like security, arbitrary punishments, and pharmacological abuse through the forced prescription of dangerous drugs. Even with these measures, schools not only fail to educate students, but the drive to teach has become secondary to the need to control children.THE WAR ON KIDS begins with the history of Zero Tolerance policy. In the 1990s, almost all schools began instituting guidelines that were originally designed to keep weapons and drugs off campus. Very quickly, school officials began to arbitrarily decide what should be considered a weapon and what should be considered a drug. Hundreds of situations followed where children were (and continue to be) suspended or expelled for possessing food knives, nail clippers, key chains, chicken strips, aspirin, and candy. Kindergarteners were even suspended for playing cops and robbers and using their fingers as guns. Under the guise of Zero Tolerance, administrators have been able to wield tremendous power without the burden of responsibility and this authority continues to be increasingly abused. Students invariably feel despondent and fearful in the Kafka-esque state that has been...

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Beware the garlic-sausage and lentil stew. Review: I suspect that these recipes were not tested or proof-read. On page 110, the recipe for lentil and garlic-sausage stew calls for two tablespoons of salt. I assumed that was a typo, but even with two teaspoons of salt, the dish was inedible. I can only assume that M. Valenti expects you to use the very same sausage he uses; he makes no allowances for variations.The recipes also call for an annoying number of exotic ingredents, and offers no suggestions for substitutions. Porcini mushrooms, penette pasta, imported Italian tuna, arborio rice, smoked duck. This exotica might make the restaurant dishes spectacular, but for the home cook, they serve only to render the recipes expensive and unforgiving. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses frustration with the recipes, saying they are untested, lack allowances for ingredient variations, and call for a number of exotic ingredients without substitution suggestions. The review specifically mentions an incident with a lentil and garlic-sausage stew where the salt amount led to an inedible dish. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the use of expensive, hard-to-find ingredients, making the recipes less accessible for home cooks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005? , can you please find it? The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas. There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold. In five years, 250 thousand more cars are circulating in Caracas on...

Answer the following question: This article: Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack. Disguising herself, she goes to a bar where Carl is drinking and signals her availability. Terry follows her as she leaves to go home and, when Carl attacks, the two are able to repel him. He escapes, only to be caught by the police who Terry forewarned. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that plots with Denise?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person that plots with Denise is Terry. In the article, Terry initially tries to protect Sylvia when she witnesses an attack, and later teams up with Denise to plan a plot to provoke the attacker, Carl, into another assault.

Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Q: Context: The extracellular interactions of plasma clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa) with tissue factor (TF) on the cell surface trigger intracellular signaling events involved in multiple physiological processes. TF expression is related to the metastatic potential of tumor cells and is a significant risk factor in the development of hepatic metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. At present, it is unclear how the interaction between TF and FVIIa influences the development of metastasis in colon cancer.', 'We used a stable LOVO cell line derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma for our model Western blot analysis, Northern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and RNA inference (RNAi), and the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System technology were utilized to determine if MMP7 can be up-regulated by the VIIa/TF complex.', 'Northern blot analysis confirmed that the plasma clotting factor FVIIa/TF complex resulted in a marked increase in MMP7 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner via the p38 pathway in vitro. The proximal promoter of the human MMP7 gene was cloned into a luciferase reporter construction (MMP7.luc1592). Upon treatment with FVIIa, reporter activity in LOVO cells was increased by 2.5-fold. TF RNAi almost completely abolished FVIIa-mediated MMP7.luc induction. Deletion constructs from MMP7.luc1592 further defined an active promoter region. Answer: Taken together, these data provide evidence that expression of MMP7 in colon cancer may be regulated by FVIIa and TF at the transcriptional level. MMP7 may act as a downstream mediator of FVIIa/TF signal transduction to facilitate the development of metastasis in colon cancer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Using a saber or keyhole saw, cut out the bottom of the bucket. Use 40 to 60-grit sandpaper to sand the edges until they are smooth. By removing the bottom of the bucket, it will be easier to lift the bucket off of the sand. If you do not want to remove the bottom yourself, then ask the hardware store if they can do it for you. Alternatively, use a regular bucket without the bottom removed if you do not have a 1 gallon (3.8 l) bucket. You can purchase 1 gallon (3.8 l) buckets, saws, and sandpaper from your local hardware store. Fill a third of the bucket with sand. Add an equal amount of water to the sand. Pack the sand down with your hands. Repeat this process until the bucket is full of compact sand. Remove the bucket. Once the sand feels solid enough and does not give under pressure, it is compact. Ask you create the layers of sand, place the bucketfuls of sand close together. Fill in gaps between the bucketfuls of sand with more sand and water. Pack the sand with your hands until the base feels solid. Keep adding layers of sand until you have reached your desired height. Once you have reached your desired height, use a sand wedge hoe or a plastic knife to smooth the surface of the sand flat. Large sandcastles are typically 5 by 5 feet (1.5 by 1.5 m) or bigger. If you plan to build a sandcastle taller than you, then bring a step ladder to the beach so you can reach the top.

He is grilling meat. 3. He is doing this action on his barbecue. Now let's analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis simply states that a man grills meat. It doesn't specify any emotions, such as happiness, nor does it mention the barbecue explicitly. However, the hypothesis doesn't conflict with any of the information provided in the premise. When we compare the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that they are talking about the same scenario–a man grilling meat. The only difference is that the premise adds extra details about the man being happy and using his barbecue. However, these additional details do not contradict the hypothesis in any way.

Write highlights for this article: A ceasefire negotiated between rival Muslim and Christian militias brought a brief respite Saturday to a Central African Republic town after two days of violent clashes. The truce between the Muslim Seleka militia and the Christian anti-Balaka in Bossangoa allowed aid agencies to begin assessing the needs of the population caught in the midst of the violence. At the Ecole Liberte school, where a makeshift displaced camp sprang up in September to harbor fleeing Muslims, the numbers swelled during the clashes from around 2,500 displaced to nearly 10,000. The people there are in need of almost everything: food, water and shelter. Over in a Catholic Church compound where 35,000 Christians sought refuge from the Seleka militias in September, the camp is more established, but water and food supplies are dwindling and there is very little shelter from the elements. Malaria and malnutrition are all too common among the camps' denizens. A tense standoff had developed earlier between the Seleka and the regional peacekeeping force, FOMAC, after the militia threw grenades into the compound in an attempt to storm it. A soldier from FOMAC was killed during an exchange of fire. There is still no official death toll, but witnesses at the Ecole Liberte camp told CNN at least 19 Muslims were killed in what has become a spiraling cycle of retribution between the two communities. The anti-Balaka began targeting Muslims after tens of thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes as Seleka militias marauded through the countryside. 'Extremely dire circumstances' Julian Donald overseeing a hospital in Bossangoa managed by Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the aid group had worked through the violence, almost overwhelmed by the flood of patients. \\"We have been fully operational the entire time,\\" he said. \\"I can't give you any numbers right now, I'm sorry, all I can say is it's still ongoing.\\" But the work he and his agency do is not enough, Donald said. The Central African Republic desperately needs more help from the outside world. \\"A situation where you have hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances, I would hope that the international community would mobilize to provide them assistance,\\" he said. \\"The fact that we haven't seen it happen yet is a tragedy.\\" Some help could be on the way. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution approving military intervention in the Central African Republic by an African Union-led force, backed by French troops, to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. The number of African Union peacekeeping troops in the country will increase to 6,000 -- up from the current 3,500 -- the French presidency said. Central African Republic: What's going on, what's at stake, what's next. French forces arrive. France has named this mission in its former colony Operation Sangaris, after a species of butterfly there. There will be 1,600 troops in the Central African Republic by the end of Saturday, French President Francois Hollande said at the Peace and Security in Africa Summit in Paris. By Saturday evening, some of them had arrived in the northern city of Bossangoa. France's goal is for the nation to be able to hold elections once security is restored, in the same way that France helped Mali return to democracy, Hollande said. France's intervention in the Central African Republic is for humanitarian reasons, not to fight terrorism, he said. There have not been many incidents of violence in the country Saturday, Hollande added. The start of the French soldiers' new operation in the CAR capital was announced Friday morning by Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on the French radio station RFI. About 185 miles south of Bossangoa, Bangui has also been rocked by two days of clashes. Many have flocked to the city's airport, hoping to find safety there. \\"We estimate at least at 400 to 500 people have been killed so far in Bangui and the killings continue,\\" Peter N. Bouckaert, emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, told CNN Saturday. \\"Two hundred and eighty bodies were recovered as of yesterday, but the Red Cross tells us there are more bodies on the streets that they are working to recover.\\" Medecins Sans Frontieres said Friday that at least 92 bodies had been brought to the morgue of a hospital where its staff is working. Another 170 people have been treated for injuries, including gunshot, machete or knife wounds, it said. Opinion: Why Central African Republic is slipping close to catastrophe. Air sorties. A French Defense Ministry statement early Saturday said three helicopters and hundreds more troops had arrived in Bangui. French troops have been out on patrol in a bid to restore calm to the city, which remains tense, as well as working to safeguard French nationals and secure the airport, the statement said. Aerial sorties have also been launched above the capital to signal the French forces' presence to armed forces thought to be opposed to them. Back at the Catholic Church compound in Bossangoa, people scattered, screaming, as the unfamiliar boom of a low-flying jet swept over them. The horror soon turned to laughs of jubilation, however, with shouts of \\"The French! The French!\\" Desperate for help from the outside world, they hoped the sonic boom was a sign from the French forces that they would soon be there too.

There were so many computers there that I didn't know how to choose a right one. \\"Hi! What can I do for you?\\" A young man greeted me with a sweet smile. He looked like not a salesman but a student like me. I sensed a strange feeling -- as if I had met him before. He began patiently showing me each model. With his help, I decided to buy one computer with enough functions at a very low price. I enjoyed this shopping experience because of his smile.

Donald was a self-taught typist, his fingers flying across the keyboard in a haphazard dance, while Kevin was a typing maestro, his touch typist's method precise and efficient. Step 1: Determine the story's tone and setting. In this story, we see Donald and Kevin as friends who share an interest in typing. The amusing, light-hearted tone suggests that they might be involved in a friendly competition or a humorous situation. Step 2: Introduce a situation or challenge. One day, during their lunch break at the office, a few of their colleagues decided to organize an impromptu typing contest. Two keyboards were connected to the same computer, and the contenders had to type out a given text as quickly and accurately as possible. Step 3: Show their initial responses and reactions. Donald secretly welcomed the challenge, confident that his unique typing style would help him prevail against his formally trained friend. Kevin, on the other hand, felt assured, believing that his structured approach would reveal Donald's amateurish technique. Step 4: Describe the challenge or event. As the two friends sat down at the workstation, a small crowd of coworkers had gathered to witness the spectacle. The judge announced the contest's rules: the text to be typed would be a paragraph from a popular novel, and the only goal was to finish first without errors. The room grew silent in anticipation as the judge prepared to reveal the text. Step 5: Describe the progress of the task. At the word \\"go,\\" both Donald and Kevin's fingers sprang to life on the keyboards. The crowd watched in awe as Donald's fingers seemingly drummed and danced on the keys, while Kevin's fingers moved like a well-orchestrated dance troupe. Each keystroke added to the furious crescendo of clacking keys. Step 6: Introduce an unexpected twist. Halfway through the paragraph, a coworker accidentally bumped into Donald, jolting his hand and sending his fingers flying off course. Seizing the opportunity, Kevin's typing sped up even more, driven by the prospect of victory. Step 7: Show the characters' reactions and the story's resolution. Donald, refusing to give in, shook off the momentary setback and resumed his whirlwind typing, striving to catch up. Miraculously, his frenzied determination paid off - he managed to close the gap and soon, both friends were neck-and-neck. As they reached the final sentence, with hearts pounding and breaths held, the room erupted in a furious cheer as both friends finished their respective paragraphs simultaneously. Step 8: End the story with a conclusion that reflects on the characters and events. The friendly contest ended in a tie, leaving everyone in high spirits. Donald and Kevin exchanged looks, acknowledging each other's incredible skills and shared passion. Through it all, they found that their differing typing styles, though distinct in nature, were equally matched in talent. The event not only solidified the respect they had for one another but reminded everyone in the room that there is often more than one way to achieve greatness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the word \\"keep\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? Keep notes. Keep open the possibility of a merger.","completion":"To analyze the usage of the word \\"keep\\" in both sentences, let us first break down the structure, and understand the meaning of each sentence. 1. Keep notes. Step 1: Identify structure - In this sentence, \\"keep\\" is a verb, and \\"notes\\" is a direct object. Step 2: Determine meaning - In context, this sentence means to retain, hold onto, or maintain notes, possibly for future reference or as a reminder. 2. Keep open the possibility of a merger. Step 1: Identify structure - In this sentence, \\"keep\\" is a verb, \\"open\\" is an adjective, and \\"possibility of a merger\\" is the direct object. Step 2: Determine meaning - In context, this sentence means to maintain, allow, or ensure that there remains the option for a potential merger. In both sentences, the word \\"keep\\" is used as a verb to convey the action of maintaining or continuing a certain condition. However, the specific usage in each sentence differs slightly. In the first sentence, \\"keep\\" directly applies to the object \\"notes,\\" indicating the action of holding onto or preserving notes. In the second sentence, \\"keep\\" applies to \\"open the possibility of a merger,\\" implying the ongoing maintenance or allowance of the possibility for a merger to happen.

The filming of a race scene in the latest Fast and Furious film was cancelled by studio bosses because it was too dangerous, it has been reported. The scene was reportedly due to feature a modified yellow Chevelle performing a wheelie while racing another car with cheering bystanders by the side of a track. Sources have told TMZ that studio bosses on Thursday cancelled the shot just before filming began over fears of another crash following the tragic accident of the film franchise's star Paul Walker last year. A race scene in the latest Fast and Furious film, similar to a sequence in the first film (pictured), has been cancelled by the studio, it has been reported. Paul Walker, who shot to fame in the Fast And Furious franchise alongside Vin Diesel, died at the age of 40 in a high-speed car crash in Santa Clarita, California, in November.

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? They wouldn't leave soon. Options: [+] unacceptable; [+] acceptable;","completion":"[+] acceptable; The sentence \\"They wouldn't leave soon\\" can be considered acceptable by the strictest standards of a linguist, for several reasons. First, let's break down the sentence to analyze its components and why it is grammatically correct. 1. Subject: \\"They\\" is a plural pronoun that serves as the subject of the sentence. The use of \\"they\\" is correct because it can refer to multiple people or things, and it agrees with the plural verb form in the sentence. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"would\\" is a modal auxiliary verb that is used to express a possibility or a hypothetical situation. In this case, it is used as the negative form \\"wouldn't,\\" which is a contraction of \\"would not.\\" This form is commonly used in informal spoken and written language. The use of \\"wouldn't\\" is appropriate because it helps convey the hypothetical nature of the situation being described. 3. Main verb: \\"leave\\" is the main verb of the sentence. It is an action verb that indicates departing from a place, and it agrees with the plural subject \\"they.\\" 4. Adverb of time: \\"soon\\" is an adverb of time, which provides information about when the action of the verb will occur or how long it will take. In this case, \\"soon\\" suggests that the action of leaving would not be happening in the near future. When combined, these elements form a sentence that is grammatically accurate and acceptable, according to the rules of English grammar. While the semantics of the sentence might be somewhat ambiguous and open to interpretation, the syntax and structure of the sentence are sound and adhere to standard linguistic guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide some context and background, the 2010 United States House of Representatives elections took place on November 2, 2010. It occurred during President Barack Obama's first term of office. These elections were held in the backdrop of a struggling economy, slow recovery from the recession, high unemployment rates, and dissatisfaction with the Obama administration's policies - like the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The outcomes of the 2010 elections were described as a \\"Republican wave,\\" as the Republican Party gained a significant number of seats in the House of Representatives. During the election, the Republicans gained 63 seats, which was the largest seat gain since the 1948 elections. This resulted in the Republicans taking control of the House with a total of 242 seats, compared to the Democrats' 193 seats. This shift in power had a considerable impact on the legislative agenda and dynamics in Washington. The Republican-controlled House was able to stall or block many of Obama's policy initiatives, leading to a substantial slowdown in implementing new legislation during the remainder of his presidency. Consequently, as a result of these elections and the Democrats losing control of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who served as the House Speaker from 2007 to 2011, sought to continue her leadership role within her party by running for the Minority Leader post. She was elected to the position in November 2010, remaining the House Democratic leader until she regained her position as Speaker of the House after the Democrats won the majority in the 2018 elections. So, by analyzing the provided sentence, it can be concluded that the Democratic Party was the one that lost control of the House in the 2010 elections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb. Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia clubs him is a good one). The creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!

The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier).

Movie plot title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie.

Ballard of California State University, Sacramento. \\"If they didn’t steam the stamp off and it was stored in a cool dry place, maybe there’s sufficient DNA left.\\" The April 25 arrest of 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo in the Golden State Killer case has renewed interest in the state's Zodiac serial killer saga, which was the subject of a 2007 movie \\"Zodiac.\\" But detectives say the timing is pure coincidence. In a bid similar to the one undertaken by Golden State Killer investigators, police in Vallejo, California, sent two letters connected to the suspect to a private lab months ago, Detective Terry Poyser said. He added that the results of the newest DNA testing were expected soon and that detectives hope to submit them to a familial DNA service. Investigators in the Golden State Killer case uploaded DNA to an open-source genealogical website, where they claim to have found a partial match to DeAngelo's distant relative. Police who collared the former police officer said they had to produce a family tree dating back several generations before they zeroed in on DeAngelo, suspected in at least 12 murders and 50 rapes between 1976 and 1986. Ballard is optimistic about the odds of catching the Zodiac Killer. She said the science of extracting DNA from everyday items continues to accelerate. \\"Our power of discrimination has gone through the roof,\\" she said. Gary Harmor, director of a private lab known as the Serological Research Institute, said he's concerned the letters are too old to produce usable markers. \\"I have worked with DNA from the 1960s and '70s at my lab,\\" he said. \\"It’s hard to get enough that hasn’t degraded to get a profile from it.\\" Experts say another question is whether or not the evidence in the Zodiac file was stored in a cool, dry place or in a freezer. Because advances in DNA technology didn't start to change investigative protocols until the 1980s, the samples kept by Zodiac detectives would have had time to degenerate and take on bacteria. ||||| Investigators searching for the Zodiac Killer have submitted evidence to a private DNA lab in the hopes of obtaining a genetic profile of one of California's most elusive criminals — then tracking him down using the same kind of family-tree tracing recently used in the East Area Rapist case. Vallejo police Detective Terry Poyser, who has worked the Zodiac case for four years, said his agency has submitted two envelopes that contained letters from the Zodiac Killer for a type of advanced DNA analysis that previously had not been available in the case. Poyser declined to identify the lab, but said it would attempt to obtain a full DNA profile from saliva on the envelope flap and stamps. He said he expected to have results back from the lab as soon as in the next few weeks, and almost certainly by summer. \\"They were confident they would be able to get something off it,\\" Poyser said. Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! He said the envelopes had been sent to the lab a few months ago, before Joseph DeAngelo, who is suspected of being the East Area Rapist, was caught after investigators used a DNA profile run though an open-source database. Poyser said he hoped the same approach could be used if a complete profile of the Zodiac is obtained. \\"If we get a good profile, then you start tracking back,\\" Poyser said. \\"It really comes down to DNA. Without it, you have nothing. It's a 50-years-old case.\\" The use of public genealogy sites to track criminal DNA is relatively new. Prior to the case of the East Area Rapist, also known as the Golden State Killer, most investigations were limited to running DNA samples through state and federal databases that largely only contain DNA from convicted felons. To be successful, those searches required the DNA belong to someone previously convicted, or to a close relative who also was a felon and therefore in the database. In the East Area Rapist case, investigators have said they uploaded a genetic profile into an open source DNA database used by amateur genealogists searching for relatives, providing a much wider pool of potential matches. Poyser said Vallejo police plan to do the same if a Zodiac sample is obtained. \\"We are having (the evidence) retested, and then we will go the routes we can,\\" he said. SHARE COPY LINK With the exception of identical twins, each person has a unique DNA profile. This makes DNA matching a powerful tool for finding and convicting the perpetrator of a crime. The Zodiac Killer roamed Northern California from December 1968 through October 1969, but was never caught despite at least one close run-in with police. He is known to have attacked seven victims — in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa and San Francisco — killing five and leaving two survivors. However, the Zodiac claimed responsibility for many more deaths in letters, often signed with a symbol of a cross over a circle. Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday were the first victims, on Dec. 20, 1968. The two high school students were shot on Lake Herman Road in Benicia, close to Vallejo. A little more than six months later, the Zodiac struck again just a few miles from the first attack. On July 4, 1969, he shot Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau in Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo. Ferrin died, but Mageau survived. The Zodiac killed two more times. At Lake Berryessa in Napa County, he attacked a young couple in September 1969. In that incident, he killed Cecelia Shepard, but her companion, Bryan Hartnell, survived. Two weeks later, the Zodiac shot San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. Vallejo became the lead agency in the case because of the Lake Herman Road killings and the Ferrin killing. When the Zodiac sent letters to Bay Area newspapers, they were forwarded to Vallejo police, Poyser said. \\"That was our case at the time,\\" he said. \\"(San Francisco) hadn't had the homicide of the cab driver yet.\\" The department has three letters and two envelopes from the Zodiac, Poyser said. The envelopes each have a double stamp, which Poyser said was a trademark of the Zodiac. They originally were sent to the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner, he said. The third letter was sent to the Vallejo Times-Herald, but does not have an envelope with it, he said. San Francisco police, who have been working on the case collaboratively with Vallejo, also have cards and ciphers sent by the Zodiac, he said. Poyser said he believes the Zodiac Killer is no longer alive. Arthur Leigh Allen, a former elementary school teacher and convicted child molester who lived in Vallejo, long was considered a top suspect. Allen died in 1992 at the age of 58, according to media reports. \\"Our Vallejo suspect is probably still the best lead,\\" Poyser said of Allen. \\"There are probably 30 different circumstantial things that point to him. ... He was extremely intelligent but a deviant dude.\\" Allen largely was cleared as a suspect in 2002, when investigators obtained a partial DNA sample from the envelopes that didn't match his. Poyser said that DNA profile only had a few markers on it, less than half of the genetic points needed to definitively clear or identify a suspect. Poyser said that DNA sample was hampered because technology didn't exist at the time to separate the glue used on the stamps and envelopes from the genetic material. However, science now has advanced to allow a clean grab of the DNA. Poyser also said Allen was known to have asked other people to lick stamps and envelopes for him, claiming he didn't like the taste of the glue. \\"One of his friends actually said he did it for him, and we've had a couple people who lived in the neighborhood at the time say they did it as children,\\" he said. Poyser said if a clean DNA sample is obtained, police might ask those who licked materials for Allen to submit DNA swabs. If they matched the Zodiac profile, it would provide another link to Allen, he said. Even if Allen doesn't prove to be the Zodiac, Poyser said he believes it was someone familiar with Vallejo, and perhaps with a law enforcement or military background. He pointed out that the first four victims all were shot in rural areas likely only known to locals. He also said that Ferrin, the 22-year-old woman shot and killed in Blue Rock Springs Park, may have been known to the killer. She was a waitress in a Vallejo restaurant and, though married, was dating at least one police officer, a possible link to the Zodiac, Poyser said. Poyser, who plans on retiring next year after 25 years of police work, said he thinks a resolution to the case is possible. \\"People need to know that the agencies involved in this — Napa, Vallejo and San Francisco — have been cooperating with each other for quite some time, and everybody is committed to closing it out.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Investigators searching for the Zodiac Killer have submitted evidence to a private DNA lab in the hopes of obtaining a genetic profile of one of California's most elusive criminals.

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles.

The current population is ethnically mixed. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as \\"Smbak'è\\" (Som-ba Kay) (\\"where the money is\\"). - ( Robert ) Gordon Robertson , PC CC FRSC ( May 19 , 1917 -- January 15 , 2013 ) was Commissioner of the Northwest Territories from November 15 , 1953 to July 12 , 1963 who , having been sworn in at the age of 36 , remains the youngest person to ever hold the office .

Your job is to generate a story 100 to 1000 words long, that includes all the facts given as input in their order of appearance while expanding upon them to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Q: Fact1: Fate brings them in Chennai, Fact2: forces to come to India to get events, Fact3: parents arrange wedding with Ramya, Fact4: Ramya decides to get married to help her 's love, Fact5: Ramya 's mother ends up in hospital A:","completion":"The task is to write a story that is between 100 and 1000 words long. The story must incorporate five key facts in the order they are provided. These facts are: 1. Fate brings them in Chennai. 2. Forces to come to India to get events. 3. Parents arrange a wedding with Ramya. 4. Ramya decides to get married to help her love. 5. Ramya's mother ends up in the hospital. To complete the task, start by establishing the main characters and setting. Once the context is clear, incorporate the five facts in chronological order, making sure they remain the main points in the story. As you develop the narrative, ensure that the story remains coherent and the key facts are woven seamlessly into the broader narrative. Here's a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Develop the setting and introduce the main characters. Since the story is set in Chennai, India, describe the city's atmosphere and culture. Introduce the characters who fate brings to Chennai. For example, the protagonist could be an individual who had to move to Chennai for work or other purposes. Step 2: Incorporate Fact 1 into the narrative. Explain why fate brings the characters to Chennai. This could be due to work, adventure, or any other reason you find interesting and coherent. Make sure that the reason aligns with the storyline. Step 3: Incorporate Fact 2 into the narrative. Describe the forces or events that make the characters come to India. These events could be professional or personal in nature. For example, the character could be attending a work conference or visiting family. Step 4: Incorporate Fact 3 into the narrative. Introduce Ramya - the character that the protagonist's parents want their child to marry. As their parents arrange the wedding, describe the emotions and thoughts of the characters involved, including their expectations and fears. Step 5: Incorporate Fact 4 into the narrative. Explain Ramya's decision to marry the protagonist. How or why does she believe this will help her love? This could involve a love triangle or a situation where Ramya believes the protagonist can provide something her love needs, like financial stability. Step 6: Incorporate Fact 5 into the narrative. Describe Ramya's mother's hospitalization and how it ends up affecting the characters' lives, including their decisions and relationships. Step 7: Conclude the story by tying up any loose ends and providing closure for the characters. Reflect on the impact of the five key facts on the characters and their journey. By following these steps and weaving the five key facts into a coherent and engaging narrative, the task of creating a story between 100 and 1000 words in length will be completed successfully."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available options: *after approval from Trump only; *not enough information; *before approval from the states; *after approval from the states and Trump; Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: When can the National Guard be deployed to the border of US and Mexico?

Therefore, this phenomenon falls within the realm of food export, where substances intended for human consumption are shipped from one region or country to another. The explicit information in the premise entails the idea that food produced in Crete is being exported to various locations across the globe. This confirms the truth of the hypothesis. Furthermore, the premise also mentions that \\"the seasonal gluts that used to see farming families through the winter now end up on tables in lands far away.\\" A \\"seasonal glut\\" essentially refers to an excessive supply or production of certain crops during particular seasons. From the context, we can infer that these surplus products produced by farming families in Crete are being exported to foreign nations rather than being stored for their own consumption during winter as they were traditionally intended. This detail from the premise upholds the hypothesis and supports the fact that there is an active export of Cretan food. Notably, promoting the export of local foods can have several implications. It contributes to the global recognition and appreciation of the unique Cretan diet. It also stimulates the local economy by creating a demand in foreign markets, offering opportunities for farmers and the wider community to generate additional income. This phenomenon can also play a role in cultural exchange, where different cuisines are introduced and embraced by people in various parts of the world. This unique expansion and export of the Cretan diet can result in international consumers becoming more aware of the specific ingredients, flavors, and nutritional benefits inherent in the cuisine. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"There are some Cretan foods that get exported\\" is not only proven through the information from the premise, but also seems to encourage a profound implications on cultural and economic fronts by generating global awareness and appreciation of the Cretan diet, as well as by supporting the local economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Многие люди сегодня считают, что такие попытки \\"обновить\\" социалистическую систему и заставить ее работать для людей, были с самого начала обречены на неудачу. Translate this to English?","completion":"Many people today believe that attempts to \\"renew\\" the socialist system and make it work for the people were doomed to fail from the very beginning. In the late 20th century, numerous countries with socialist systems underwent various reform attempts with the intention of improving their economies and standard of living for their citizens. These efforts were undertaken to address the drawbacks and inefficiencies observed within the planned economic systems, which were seen as less dynamic and less competitive compared to the market-oriented economies in the Western world. Consequently, these reform initiatives predominantly aimed at promoting higher levels of productivity, innovation, and responsiveness to the needs and demands of the populace. Some argue that such attempts to \\"renew\\" the socialist system inherently faced several challenges that eventually contributed to their failure. One significant challenge was the inherent contradiction between the fundamental principles of socialism and the need to implement market-oriented reforms that would drive efficiencies within the economy. Adopting market strategies in a socialist economy requires significant changes to the system that would ultimately undermine the very foundations of socialism - a planned and state-controlled economy - and move it closer to a market-oriented, capitalistic approach. Another underlying issue was the resistance to change within the political and bureaucratic elite who held power. In many socialist states, the dominant political elites often controlled the state-owned enterprises and the key decision-making processes. Consequently, they held vested interests in maintaining the status quo to protect their power, privileges, and networks of patronage. This resistance to change hindered the implementation and progress of any significant reform policies aimed at promoting tangible improvements within the socialist system. Moreover, the lack of effective mechanisms to enforce accountability and transparency within the socialist countries further exacerbated these issues. Widespread corruption, nepotism, and lack of oversight all contributed to weak governance structures that undermined even the most well-intentioned attempts at reforming the socialist system. This lack of accountability often resulted in resources being misallocated or siphoned off by corrupt officials rather than being directed towards productive investments and other critical areas that would benefit the population. Lastly, the lack of open and participatory political systems in socialist countries often stifled dissent and debate, making it difficult for citizens to have an influence on the direction and nature of reforms. This lack of engagement from the public meant that even if some reformists within the political elite sincerely wanted to address the system's flaws, their efforts would be disconnected from the broader needs and aspirations of the people. In conclusion, numerous factors contributed to the failure of attempts to \\"renew\\" the socialist system and make it work for the people. These factors include the inherent contradictions between the fundamental principles of socialism and market-oriented reforms, the resistance to change from the political and bureaucratic elite, weak governance structures, and the lack of open and participatory political systems. These challenges ultimately resulted in the collapse of most socialist systems in the late 20th century and the rise of various forms of hybrid market-socialist or market-oriented systems in their place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You have to deal with new responsibilities and growing independence, a challenging course load and, of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger. But having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to compromise, things can work out just fine. When you first meet your roommate, chances are you'll be on your best behaviour. You want to get along, since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential worst cases, too. For example, imagine it's 2 a.m. and you're working on a paper that should be finished in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room. At times like these, you won't be feeling good. That's why talking about problems that might come up ahead of time -- and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes -- is so important. Talk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same.

Information: - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Amaranthus, collectively known as amaranth, is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants. Most of the species from \\"Amaranthus\\" are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed. Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn. Approximately 60 species are recognized, with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple and red to green or gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus \\"Celosia\\". - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

The middle digit (the fifth digit) can also be any of 0 to 9, giving 10 possibilities. So to count the number of possibilities, we multiply the number of choices at each digit-place to get the total: 4 (choices for 1st and 9th) * 10 (for 2nd and 8th) * 10 (for 3rd and 7th) * 10 (for 4th and 6th) * 10 (for 5th) 4 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 40,000.

Since preventing weight loss is easier than trying to gain weight during treatment, keep an eye on your weight. Get on the scale at least three times a week.","completion":"If you notice that you are starting to lose weight, take proactive measures to increase your calorie and nutrient intake. To do so, you should focus on consuming high-calorie, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Gradually incorporate healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado, and nuts into your meals to boost the calorie count. Protein-rich foods like eggs, lean meats, fish, beans, and dairy products are also important, as they provide your body with the necessary building blocks for cell repair and growth. During chemotherapy, it is vital to consume smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day rather than sticking to the traditional three meals per day pattern. Aim for at least five to six meals a day, which may help prevent nausea associated with chemotherapy and ensures a constant supply of energy and nutrients. Don't forget to include snacks that are rich in calories and nutrients, like nuts, dried fruits, cheese, yogurt, and granola bars. Hydration is essential during treatment, but drinks can be turned into another opportunity to gain weight. Consuming liquid calories is sometimes easier for those experiencing nausea or reduced appetite. Opt for calorie-rich beverages like smoothies, milkshakes, and nutritional supplement drinks, and avoid consuming large volumes of low-calorie drinks like water or unsweetened tea too close to meal times, as they may fill you up and hinder your food intake. Chemotherapy can sap energy levels, leading to less physical activity and reduced muscle mass, thereby causing weight loss. Therefore, it is important to engage in light exercise such as walking, yoga, or stretching on a regular basis to maintain your muscle mass and strength. Consult your healthcare team for appropriate exercises and guidelines for your specific situation. Another crucial factor during chemotherapy is managing symptoms and side effects that can potentially affect your appetite and ability to consume food. Maintaining open communication with your healthcare team will help in addressing these issues promptly, and they may adjust your treatment or prescribe medications to help alleviate these symptoms. Lastly, consider working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who specializes in cancer care. They will evaluate your current calorie and nutrient intake, provide tailored recommendations to help you gain weight, and suggest strategies to manage chemotherapy-related side effects affecting your eating habits. In conclusion, gaining weight during chemotherapy can be challenging, but with a proactive approach, it is possible to minimize weight loss and improve your overall quality of life. Focus on consuming high-calorie, nutrient-dense foods, eating smaller meals more frequently, incorporating calorie-rich beverages, engaging in light exercise, managing side effects, and working with a dietitian or nutritionist to better understand your nutritional needs during treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was awarded the OBE in 1963. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast.

A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area.

Article: Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive. Question: Electrodes are often glued to what like in EEG studies?","completion":"In EEG (electroencephalogram) studies, electrodes are often glued to the scalp of the subject. These electrodes are non-invasive and are used to record the electrical activity of the brain by detecting the fluctuations in voltage caused by the synchronized activity of neurons.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens? York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens is Etty."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires. Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \\"doping\\" treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments. What other materials were combined with tungsten?","completion":"The passage states that besides tungsten, other materials used to improve the life and durability of the tungsten filaments were potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides. These substances were used at a very small level, typically that of a few hundred parts per million, in a process commonly referred to as \\"doping.\\" These doping agents helped to enhance the characteristics of the tungsten - primarily by preventing the sagging of the filaments when in use. This technique allowed for production of ductile tungsten, reinforcing the strength and hardness of the material. This addition, however minor, vastly improved the efficiency, resilience, and lifespan of the tungsten filaments, making it a critical development in its production process. Through this fine-tuning of the tungsten's properties, the filaments were able to withstand higher temperatures and emit a brighter light, improving their function in applications such as light bulb production, electronics, and various other industries requiring durable and heat-resistant materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: India decided to introduce several exotic species into their environment, while Singapore was very protective of its native species. India encountered big problems with extinction during the following years. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had more species go extinct? The answer is:","completion":"India had more species go extinct. India, as mentioned in the paragraph, decided to introduce several exotic species into their environment. Exotic species, also known as invasive species or non-native species, are organisms that humans have moved from their native habitat to a new location. Introducing these species can often lead to imbalances in the ecosystems, as they tend to outcompete native species for resources such as food, water, and space, thereby disrupting the local food chains. On the other hand, Singapore was very protective of its native species, meaning that they carefully managed their environment and natural resources to prevent the introduction of exotic species and preserve the native habitat and ecosystems. As a result, they were better able to maintain a balanced environment that allowed their native species to thrive. Due to India's decision to introduce exotic species, the country experienced significant problems with extinction in the following years. The rapid proliferation of invasive species can lead to a decline in the population of native species, either due to predation or competition for resources. If a species is unable to adapt or compete with the new pressure, it may eventually face extinction. In conclusion, the country that had more species go extinct is India, as a result of the issues created by the introduction of exotic species into their environment, while Singapore worked to protect its native species and maintain a balanced ecosystem. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the ecological consequences of introducing non-native species, as well as the need for proactive conservation efforts to protect and preserve biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil? Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be deduced that the farmer who observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil was Bill, who had a parcel covered in grasslands. The paragraph states that precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration, which causes the soil to develop in relative drought. This results in decreased leaching and migration of weathering products. Additionally, the large amounts of evaporation in grasslands lead to the buildup of calcium and other large cations, which flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. With impermeable clay limiting the downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, chemical weathering and podzolization are reduced. The paragraph also mentions that when leaching is decreased, calcium precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, creating a layer known as caliche. Since this process is more prevalent in grasslands, it would make sense that Bill, with his grassland parcel, would observe a greater buildup of calcium in the soil compared to Bob, who had a parcel of old growth forest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there are more detailed considerations and advice that can be given regarding carrying cash with you. Cash is an essential commodity in our daily lives, although the use of digital payment methods like credit cards, mobile wallets, and online payment platforms has increased over the years. Despite this, it's still a good idea to carry some cash with you for various reasons: 1. Convenience: Many small businesses and local vendors still operate on a cash basis, especially in remote areas without reliable internet connections or card-processing facilities. It's more convenient to have cash on hand for such purchases. 2. Emergencies: In case of emergencies or unexpected situations, cash can be a lifesaver. Examples include sudden medical needs, natural disasters, or power outages that render electronic payment methods obsolete. 3. Tipping: Some service providers like wait staff, hotel bellhops, or taxi drivers might prefer or expect cash tips, which can contribute to their income. 4. Budgeting: Carrying a certain amount of cash can help you with budgeting, as it strictly limits your spending and prevents you from overspending on non-essential items. When carrying cash with you, particularly in your purse, there are some best practices to follow: 1. Limit the amount: You don't need to carry large amounts of cash; carry only what you reasonably expect to spend in a day or during the outing. This will reduce the risk of loss or theft. 2. Store it securely: Use a purse or wallet with compartments and zippers to securely store your cash, avoiding the risk of dropping it or having it easily accessed by pickpockets. Some purses even come with RFID-blocking technology to protect your sensitive card information from electronic theft. 3. Keep it separate: It's a good idea to avoid keeping all your cash in one place. Instead, split it into smaller portions and store them in different compartments of your purse or in a separate, secured pocket. This way, if someone takes your purse or if you lose a part of it, not all your cash will be gone. 4. Be discreet: When paying with cash, avoid showing large amounts or drawing attention to your purse. This can help deter potential thieves or assailants from targeting you. 5. Safety precautions: Be aware of your surroundings and use common sense when carrying cash. Avoid flashing your cash in public and follow safety advice from authorities, especially when traveling abroad. It's also important to keep your purse secured and close to your body at all times. In conclusion, carrying cash in your purse is a suitable way to follow the statement \\"Carry all that cash with you.\\" However, it's crucial to do so responsibly, considering the risks and safety concerns while also enjoying the benefits of having cash on hand."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: One of Their Best Review: Queen of Connemara and Mary Ellen Carter are just two of the wonderful tracks on this, the last joint album by Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy.

Paragraph: Porky is looking all over the big city for a hotel room , but due to a convention there are no vacancies . Porky takes the only available vacancy at one hotel , but will have to share with Daffy Duck , who is a very loud , obnoxious and annoying sort . Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend \`\` Hymie '' , but Porky wo n't believe that . Daffy spends the rest of the night annoying Porky : pestering him with questions , shaking the bed , spilling water from a glass , hogging the blanket and finally literally sending the both of them flying off the bed when Daffy kicks , and startles , Porky with his literally frozen feet . Fed up with his antics , Porky stuffs Daffy in a pillow case and drops him out of the window . As Porky goes back to bed , Daffy returns bandaged , but shakes them off and prepares to get revenge .

Clouston became fugitive when he failed to register as convicted sex offender. Viewer tip to TV's \\"America's Most Wanted\\" led agents to Clouston, official says.","completion":"Title: Fugitive Paul Clouston Apprehended at Men's Group Home in California Introduction Paul Clouston, 73, a long-time fugitive, was taken into custody at a men's group home in California after a tip came in from a viewer of the television show \\"America's Most Wanted.\\" Clouston had previously been convicted of killing a police detective and served time for the crime. However, he became a fugitive after failing to register as a convicted sex offender, prompting a nationwide hunt for his whereabouts. 1. Paul Clouston's criminal history Paul Clouston, at the age of 73, has been a well-known criminal figure, with a notorious past that includes being convicted for the killing of a police detective. He faced justice for his actions and served a prison sentence, but his criminal activities did not end there. 2. Failure to register as a convicted sex offender After his release from prison, Clouston was required by law to register as a convicted sex offender. However, he failed to comply with this legal obligation, choosing instead to evade authorities and go on the run. This blatant disregard for the law transformed Clouston back into a fugitive and set off a nationwide search to bring him back into custody. 3. The role of \\"America's Most Wanted\\" in Clouston's capture The television show \\"America's Most Wanted\\" has been instrumental in aiding law enforcement agencies in bringing criminals like Clouston to justice. The show, which profiles notorious fugitives and unsolved crimes, proved to be invaluable when it received a viewer tip that ultimately led agents to Clouston's location – a men's group home in California. 4. Clouston's arrest and capture Acting on the viewer tip, agents were able to zero in on Clouston and take him into custody without incident. His arrest marks the end of a long-running search that spanned across multiple states, and it's a testament to the cooperation between law enforcement and the public that made this outcome possible. Conclusion The apprehension of fugitive Paul Clouston highlights the importance of collaborative efforts between law enforcement agencies and the public in bringing fugitives to justice. Thanks to \\"America's Most Wanted,\\" the diligent work of law enforcement, and the vigilant citizen who provided the tip, Clouston will now be held accountable for failing to register as a convicted sex offender. This case serves as a reminder that no one is above the law, and that justice will be eventually served."},{"prompt":"Question: Background: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered.

It is interesting in that it is the only part of the contiguous United States, aside from the small Alaskan town of Hyder, which is situated north of the 49th parallel, making it the northernmost point in the lower 48 states. Being coextensive with Angle Township, this area is closely linked to the unincorporated community of Angle Inlet. As a census-designated place (CDP), Angle Inlet is an officially recognized populated area for the purpose of gathering statistics and analyzing demographic information. The Angle is not only special geographically, but also boasts a rich history. It became a part of the United States due to an oversight in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which aimed to establish the boundary between the U.S. and British territories in North America. The treaty's wording was formulated based on a misunderstanding of the geography of the area, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Northwest Angle within the United States. Regarding the question of which country the Northwest Angle and the community of Angle Inlet belong to, the answer is the United States of America. Both the Angle and Angle Inlet are specifically located within the state of Minnesota, which is one of the 50 states of the United States. The unique geographical location, its rich history, and the close-knit community of Angle Inlet all contribute to making the Northwest Angle a fascinating and distinct region of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The sheet of cardboard can be larger than these dimensions, but not smaller. If it is larger, use a ruler and pencil to draw a 60 by 30 cm (24 by 12 in) rectangle on it. Along one of the long edges of this 60 x 30 rectangle, stick a pushpin at the halfway point (so it's 30 cm (12 in) from each end). You can also use a piece of rigid foam board instead of cardboard. Tie one end of a piece of string to the pushpin, and the other end to a pencil placed at the midpoint of the opposite long edge of the cardboard. Keep the string pulled tight and move the pencil back and forth over the cardboard sheet. The string will guide it to make a half-circle shape. Wind the string around the pencil until the distance between the pencil and pushpin is reduced to 2 cm (0.79 in). Trace a second, much smaller half-circle onto the board. This smaller circle will become the cut-out for your nose. Use sturdy scissors or a utility knife to cut along both the larger and smaller half-circles. It doesn't have to be perfect, but take your time to ensure a smooth curve to your rainbow-shaped board. If this is part of a child's science project, an adult should supervise this task or do it themselves. Scissors and especially utility knives can be very dangerous. Pick a spot roughly halfway between where the pushpin and pencil were when you started tracing. Use double-sided tape or glue to attach the bottom of a disposable plastic cup to what will be the underside of your board. You'll hold the cup with both hands to keep the board in position while taking the test. Stick the pushpin you used earlier back into the cardboard, this time just short of the spot where you originally placed the pencil to start tracing. This will serve as your focal point while you take the test. The pushpin might stick all the way through the cardboard, so be careful not to prick your finger on it while testing! Each strip should be 10 by 2 cm (3.94 by 0.79 in). Use rigid construction paper, or use markers to color strips of a rigid white paper (like index cards). You can use a different combination of easy-to-distinguish colors, but red, yellow, and green are the ideal combination. Take 3 of the strips (one of each color) and trim off two of the corners on one of the short sides of each. This will create a triangular shape at one end of each of them. When your friend uses one of these triangular strips during the test, make sure they hold it with the pointed end up. Use the handle (the attached cup) to hold the board just below eye level. The bridge of your nose should remain in contact with the small cardboard cutout. Keep the board steady and level in front of you during the test. Focus your eyes on the pushpin that's stuck in the cardboard, and don't look away from that spot. While you do this, have a friend hold up one of the colored strips at one of the far ends of the board—that is, at either “end of the rainbow.” Your friend needs to remain as still as possible during the test. It may be easiest for them to sit or stand directly across from you, past the pushpin. But keep your focus on the pushpin, not them. The paper strip should be beyond your field of vision when at the starting point. If you can detect it being there, make sure you're staring straight ahead and that your partner is holding the paper strip in the corner of the board. Have your friend slowly slide the paper strip along the curved edge of the board. As soon as you're able to detect movement in your peripheral vision, let your friend know by saying “OK” or something similar. They should pause for a moment, then continue sliding the paper strip. If you want to keep a record of your results, have your friend quickly mark this point on the underside of the board with a pencil before proceeding further. Because of how peripheral vision functions—relying more on the rods in your eyes that are sensitive to movement, rather than the color-sensitive cones—you should notice that something is moving before you can make out its shape or color. As your friend continues to move the paper strip into your field of vision, indicate when you can see more details. For instance, say “red” and then “triangle” when you see that they are using the red strip of paper with the triangular top. If desired, they can mark these spots with pencil on the underside of the board as well. You can do the test as many times as you like, but consider doing it 3 times on each side to test your left and right peripheral vision. For a more accurate test regarding your perception of color and shape, have your friend use one strip of each color on each side, in random order. For instance: red triangle to your right; yellow rectangle to your left; yellow triangle to your right; green triangle to your left; red rectangle to your right; green rectangle to your left. For example, you can reduce the light level in the room, give your eyes a few minutes to adjust, and repeat the test to see how your results compare. Or, you can write random letters or numbers on the strips and tell your friend as soon as you can read them. What is a summary?","completion":"In this DIY peripheral vision test, a rainbow-shaped cardboard or foam board is used as the testing apparatus. A pushpin serves as a focal point, while disposable plastic cups act as handles. Strips of red, yellow, and green paper with different shapes are used to test color and shape perception in peripheral vision. The person being tested holds the board just below eye level and focuses on the pushpin while a friend moves the paper strips along the curved edge of the board. The test measures when and how well the person can detect movement, shapes, and colors from their peripheral vision. The test can be repeated on both sides to assess left and right peripheral vision and under different lighting conditions for more precise results."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: What appears to be court stenographer’s note appears online after Mr Justice Peter Smith stands up for airline passengers everywhere A document appearing to be the full transcript of a judge’s bench badgering of British Airways over his lost luggage has emerged. Fleet Street last week cast the Chancery Court’s Mr Justice Peter Smith — whom The Times newspaper described as “one of the legal profession’s more colourful figures” — as the common air travellers hero after he castigated lawyers for the “world’s favourite airline”. But the bench-slapping had nothing to do with their submissions in the £3 billion lawsuit Smith was hearing — a spat in which BA was accused of colluding to fix air cargo charges. Instead it related to an entirely unrelated incident which had seen Smith’s luggage go missing on a BA flight during a recent trip to Italy. Legal Cheek cannot verify the authenticity of the document that is doing the rounds of legal London. However, it appears to be a comprehensive transcript of the court stenographer’s note. Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways Taking the brunt of Smith’s ire was Jon Turner, a silk of nine years’ standing from Monkton Chambers in Gray’s Inn. As BA’s lead counsel on the day, Turner came in for repeated questioning regarding the loss of Smith’s luggage during his recent trip Florence. At one stage the judge threatened to haul BA’s pugnacious Irish chief executive, Willie Walsh, before the court to answer some pretty searching questions on the missing luggage front. Sadly that didn’t happen, as it would have been one hell of a bout. Now, Smith is no stranger to courtroom antics. The judge once famously inserted his own coded message into a judgment he handed down on a copyright case concerning best-selling thriller novel “The Da Vince Code”. In the most recent case, according to the transcript, Smith repeatedly cross-examined BA’s lawyers about the lost luggage, while, in turn, they desperately tried to bring the proceedings back to the matter of the trial. In the end, frustrated lawyers, who included the airline’s law firm, Slaughter and May (whose partners presumably know a thing or two about international holiday travel), applied for Smith to recuse himself. The grounds were clear: anyone so arsed off with one of the litigants — no matter how legitimately in a customer service context — would not be able to hear case impartially. Smith adamantly disagreed, but he stood down nonetheless. He didn’t go quietly, telling the court: I do not believe for one minute that the reasonably minded observer … would think that merely because I have raised issues over the non-delivery of my luggage of itself should lead to the possibility of bias. I believe a reasonably minded observer would see a judge with a problem trying to resolve that issue and finding the parting question being obstructive and unwilling to address the issue and find a solution. A simple dispute as to the luggage cannot possible be grounds for recusal. However, BA and its solicitors have simply escalated the problem almost immediately. Nonetheless, Smith saw the writing on the wall in terms of public perception: I however cannot allow my presence in the case and its difficulties to distract the parties from this case. And therefore, regretfully, I feel that I have no choice, whatever my feelings about it, but to recuse myself from the case … BA’s legal team will be relieved. The rest of us will still shed a tiny tear as the case of Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways is destined to be a damn sight less entertaining than it was a week ago. Read the judgment in full below: Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways ||||| Mr Justice Peter Smith was furious at BA after his luggage went missing on a flight from Florence Tim Boyle/Getty Images The judge who stepped down from a £3 billion dispute involving British Airways after complaining about his lost luggage is being investigated by judicial conduct authorities. Mr Justice Peter Smith fired off angry emails to British Airways after his luggage failed to arrive at Gatwick after a trip to Florence — and then berated counsel when the dispute came before him in court. He agreed to step down from the case after BA’s legal team, led by Jon Turner, QC, raised questions of bias in court last week, and applied for him to stand aside. Another judge, Mrs Justice Rose, has now been appointed to succeed Mr Justice Peter Smith on the mammoth dispute which relates to a 2010 European Commission ruling that BA and… ||||| The behaviour of Mr Justice Peter Smith, who reluctantly agreed to step aside from the case last week after BA’s lawyers complained of “a real risk of bias”, has now been revealed in full after a transcript of the court exchanges was posted online. The document, which The Independent has confirmed is accurate, shows how the judge subjected the airline’s legal counsel Jon Turner QC to a barrage of questions about the whereabouts of his luggage, which had been mislaid during a trip to Florence with his wife. “Right, Mr Turner, here is a question for you. What happened to [the] luggage?” the judge asks a few minutes into the hearing. When the QC replies that his clients do not want to get involved in the issue, he shoots back: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?” Justice Peter Smith emailed the BA chairman personally to complain about his lost luggage. File photo (Getty) After Mr Turner delicately suggests that doing so would be “an inappropriate mixture of a personal dispute” with the multi-billion pound case, the judge cuts him off. “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question: namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened now,” he says. A lengthy debate follows, culminating in Mr Justice Smith darkly suggesting that BA is fighting to have him recused because the airline is worried that the case is not going in its favour. “The next judge might not be on your solicitors’ acceptable judge list,” he says. After a break in which Mr Turner contacts his instructing solicitor – before regretfully informing the judge that “she does not know what has happened to your luggage” – Mr Justice Smith says he has “no alternative” but to recuse himself. A spokesman for the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which handles complaints about the judiciary, said that Sir Peter was being “investigated under the conduct regulations”. Mrs Justice Vivien Rose has been appointed to hear the case in his place. The remarkable courtroom exchanges took place during one of the biggest competition battles to reach the UK courts. The case stems from a European Commission ruling that BA and a number of other airlines colluded to fix air cargo charges, with the firms now being sued by hundreds of companies for losses and damages. Will Gant, a reporter for the specialist legal magazine PaRR, witnessed the judge’s outburst. “I’ve been a court journalist for several years, and must have seen thousands of hearings, but frankly I was absolutely blown away by the unprofessional attitude that Mr Justice Peter Smith displayed at this one,” he told The Independent. “The room was packed with dozens of lawyers, and two or three reporters from specialist legal publications, and as this unfolded we all silently exchanged looks of complete amazement. I’ve never seen a judge allow their personal life to affect their work like this, and it was sad to watch. It was an embarrassment to British justice.” Another source familiar with the case added: “Frankly, it’s the sort of thing you might expect in other areas of the world, but not here.” In a parting shot, Mr Justice Smith then used a written judgment to chastise BA still further, suggesting that his luggage and that of his fellow passengers had been “deliberately bumped off for a more profitable cargo”. He had emailed BA’s chairman, Keith Williams, because he felt the incident “might be something that is strikingly similar to some of the allegations in this case”, he wrote. He continued: “I do not believe for one minute that the reasonably minded observer…would think that merely because I have raised issues over the non delivery of my luggage of itself should lead to the possibility of bias.” He also warned BA that he would continue his investigation into what happened to the bags “in a private capacity” and “with the vigour for which I am known”. Both British Airways and its legal advisers, Slaughter & May, declined to comment. Court records: Out of order According to a transcript, Mr Justice Peter Smith repeatedly harangued the British Airways barrister Jon Turner QC about what happened to his missing luggage. Here are some edited extracts: Mr Justice Peter Smith: Right, Mr Turner, here is a question for you. What happened to [the] luggage? Jon Turner: My Lord, the position remains that set out in the letter from Slaughter and May of 15 July, that we are not dealing with that as parties in these proceedings. PS: I am asking you: what has happened to the luggage? JT: My Lord, so far as the parties to these proceedings … are concerned, we have said, and we maintain, that we are not getting involved because we trust that that will be dealt with expeditiously, in the ordinary course of events. PS: In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today? JT: I do not wish your Lordship to do that; and I would say, if your Lordship will permit me to develop my submissions, that that would be an inappropriate mixture of a personal dispute ... PS: What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question, namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened now.... JT: Our position, my Lord, is that where your Lordship initiates a personal dispute with British Airways… PS: I didn’t initiate a personal dispute. BA’s associated company retained my luggage. It is not my fault that that happened. I am the victim. I read the whole of your correspondence. The more I read it, I got the impression that BA was trying to portray itself of the victim of this case and being oppressed by wicked Mr Justice Peter Smith. It is just ridiculous... PS: As far as I am concerned, the key fact in this case is: what happened to the luggage; and your clients know what happened to the luggage and they are not telling me. And your solicitors and you are deliberately not asking... PS: If there is a perfectly understandable operational reason as to why the whole of the flight’s luggage was left behind in Florence ... then I will accept that. That has been my stance ever since I contacted the chairman. I contacted the chairman because the BA helpline is misdescribed. Because when I contacted them, they said, “It is nothing to do with us, it is down to Vueling [BA’s Spanish partner airline]”, despite the fact that I booked my flight with BA and BA took my money. The Vueling helpline was even worse. They couldn’t even tell me where the luggage was till it, without warning, spontaneously arrived at my house last Thursday. In those circumstances, I went to the BA website and the BA website says the chairman is anxious to have comments from customers, and there is his email address, so I sent him an email. Apparently he likes reading customers’ emails. It doesn’t appear to be necessarily he does anything about it, but he obviously likes reading them over his breakfast... PS: BA as a group, as a company in a group, clearly know what happened to the luggage, because ... they cannot have accidentally left the whole of the flight’s luggage off the plane, can they? I mean, I am intrigued. It might be for some reason they only had three gallons of fuel in the plane, it would run out unless they took everything off, which is a bit difficult because the plane was actually being refuelled when we got there. But equally, it is impossible to believe that the pilot, who has to sign the documentation as to what is the weight and composition of the weight in the plane, did not know that his hold was empty; and it is equally impossible for the ground staff not to know that the luggage was not there. These are things which, I accept, I am struggling to find a rational explanation for. ||||| A judge has agreed to step down from a case after complaining his luggage had gone missing during a BA flight while he was presiding over an unrelated dispute involving the same airline. Mr Justice Peter Smith, one of the country’s most senior judges, withdrew from the £3 billion case amid accusations of bias, after he raised the matter of his missing luggage in his own court room. A new judge will now be appointed to preside over the case, over a European Commission ruling that BA was guilty of colluding to fix air cargo charges. The High Court judge was hearing a dispute involving BA, tens of thousands of firms and 30 other airlines, which dates back to 2006, By coincide he had sent emails to BA’s chairman using his judicial title after his baggage went missing on a recent trip to Italy, in which he accused airline staff of deliberately leaving behind all the plane’s luggage and deceiving passengers. The judge’s bags ‘spontaneously’ turned up at his home last week. But Mr Justice Smith went on to raise the matter in court, threatening to order BA’s chief executive to appear in front of him to explain how a whole aeroplane’s luggage could go missing He told BA’s legal team, led by Jon Turner QC: “Right, Mr Turner, here is a question for you: what happened to [the] luggage?” But when the barrister replied that they were not dealing with that issue Mr Justice Smith persisted with his line of questioning, saying: “I am asking you – what has happened to the luggage?” Mr Turner again declined to address his request, at which point Mr Justice Smith warned: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?” Despite being told it would not be appropriate to discuss a personal dispute, the judge persisted: “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question, namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened.” He added: “I do not believe for a minute that the reasonably-minded observer would think that merely because I had raised issues about the non-delivery of my luggage, that it should raise the possibility of bias.” But when BA’s legal team applied for the judge to stand aside Mr Justice Smith he agreed. One of the legal circuit’s more colourful characters Mr Justice Smith once hid a message in a High Court judgment relating to the Da Vinci Code copyright trial. In 2006, he ruled in favour of the novel’s author, Dan Brown, after rival authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh sued publisher Random House, claiming he had stolen their ideas. Italicised letters in the first seven paragraphs of the judgment spelt out ‘Smithy Code’ in a reference to his own name. Other apparently randomly italicised letters read: “Jackie Fisher, who are you? Dreadnought”. This appeared to relate to one of the judge’s own interests – Admiral Lord Fisher, who designed the battleship HMS Dreadnought. It was thought to be the first time that a message had been hidden in a formal High Court judgment. Mr Justice Smith refused to confirm that the letters were a code at the time, saying only: “They don't look like typos, do they? I can't discuss the judgment, but I don't see why a judgment should not be a matter of fun.” In May this year Mr Justice Smith blamed a father for the horrific injuries that led to the death of the man's baby daughter, even though the man was cleared by a jury. He lifted the normal anonymity rules that apply to family court judgments to name Martin Thomas, 30, as responsible for brutal attacks on four-month-old Evie Thomas from Wigan, Greater Manchester. The judge said the law would be “a screen to hide the truth” if the father was allowed to remain unnamed. In 2010 Mr Justice Smith was due to oversee a £100million trial over the controversial Chelsea Barracks development, but was replaced at the last moment after reportedly upsetting the Qatari royal family. He had overseen the pre-trial hearings involving Qatari Diar, the property arm of the Qatari royal family, which was sued by Christian Candy, a London property tycoon, for breach of contract. But the Qataris were said to be upset when a number of decisions went against them. It was later ruled that the royal family's property company had breached its contract when it withdrew a planning application for the £3bn Chelsea barracks development after the intervention of Prince Charles. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A judge was hearing a big case about British Airways in court.

Answer the question...who play davy jones in pirates of the caribbean??","completion":"The character of Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean is portrayed by none other than the talented British actor Bill Nighy. Born on December 12th, 1949, in Caterham, Surrey, England, Bill Nighy has had a prolific acting career that spans decades and includes film, television, and stage performances. His distinctive voice and unique acting style have made him a favorite for many directors and audiences alike. Nighy's portrayal of Davy Jones, the feared and tragic antagonist, first came to life in the second installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\" (2006). With his monstrous, tentacle-filled visage and haunting presence, Nighy brought depth and humanity to the character, transforming him into a memorable and complex figure. He reprised his role in the third film, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" (2007), and made a cameo appearance in the fifth installment, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” (2017). To create the character of Davy Jones, Nighy's performance was digitally infused with advanced motion capture technology, utilizing facial markers and a specially designed suit. This allowed the animators at Industrial Light & Magic, a leading visual effects company, to transform Nighy's movements and expressions into the realistic and fantastical appearance of Davy Jones. The technical process was highly detailed and time-consuming, but it beautifully blended Nighy's performance with the artistic vision of the film's creators. Beyond Pirates of the Caribbean, Bill Nighy has appeared in an array of notable films, including \\"Love Actually\\" (2003), \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" (2004), \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (2005), \\"The Constant Gardener\\" (2005), \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\\" (2010), and \\"About Time\\" (2013). He has also made an impact in television series like \\"State of Play\\" (2003), \\"Page Eight\\" (2011), and \\"The Worricker Trilogy\\" (2011-2014). In addition to his screen appearances, Nighy has an extensive background in stage acting, having worked at the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company.

What is the first name of the person who shared his suntan lotion? Answer the above question based on the context below: In the final two weeks before the test, some 250 personnel from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.Shelters were established 10,000 yards (9,100 m) due north, west and south of the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000. Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000. Many other observers were around 20 miles (32 km) away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths.Bainbridge asked Groves to keep his VIP list down to just ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, Richard Tolman, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Charles Lauritsen, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, and Sir James Chadwick. The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill, about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of the tower. The observers set up a betting pool on the results of the test. Edward Teller was the most optimistic, predicting 45 kilotons of TNT (190 TJ). He wore gloves to protect his hands, and sunglasses underneath the welding goggles that the government had supplied everyone with. Teller was also one of the few scientists to actually watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground...

Not much to chew on here in the way of a theme, but if you just get in your seat, turn your brain off, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well worn, and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in. But that didn't bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters, and there were some enticing moments when I hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines. But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused. The plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet!

Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. Question: What did they write?

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs Question: \\"Which political party cut the LSC's budget?\\" Response: \\"Republican\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Options: A. room B. store C. warehouse D. loft E. rug The answer to this question is:","completion":"B. store The best place to get furniture from is a store. There are several reasons why a store is the most sensible option among the given choices. First, furniture stores typically carry a wide variety of products, including sofas, tables, chairs, beds, dressers, and more, offering a broad selection for customers to choose from. This means that customers can find precisely what they are looking for, regardless of their style, budget, or specific needs. Most stores also have knowledgeable staff who can provide useful information and assistance when it comes to selecting the right furniture pieces. Second, furniture stores usually have well-organized showrooms where customers can see, touch, and test out the pieces they are interested in. This hands-on experience is invaluable, as it allows customers to assess the quality, comfort, and overall feel of a piece of furniture before deciding to purchase it. This in-person experience can help ensure that customers are satisfied with their purchases and that the furniture they select will be a good fit for their home. Third, furniture stores often offer various services to help make the purchasing process even more convenient. For example, many stores provide financing options, allowing customers to pay for their purchases over time, and some even offer interior design consultations to help customers choose the right furniture and accessories for their homes. In addition, most furniture stores offer delivery and assembly services, making it easy for customers to get their new furniture delivered to their homes and set up properly. While warehouses (option C) and lofts (option D) may occasionally have furniture available for sale, these locations are not specifically designed to cater to customers looking to furnish their homes. Warehouses tend to focus more on bulk sales and may not have the same level of customer service, selection, or showroom experience that a dedicated furniture store would provide. Similarly, a loft may have some unique or vintage furniture pieces, but it is unlikely to offer the wide range of options and services that customers can find in a store. As for the other options, a room (option A) is not a place where one would typically go to purchase furniture, as it is simply a space within a home or building. A rug (option E) is an item and not a location where furniture can be purchased. Therefore, neither of these options align with common sense when it comes to purchasing furniture. In conclusion, the most logical and beneficial place to purchase furniture is a store, as it offers a wide selection of products, a hands-on shopping experience, knowledgeable staff, and various additional services to make the purchasing process as convenient and enjoyable as possible for customers."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Pick from: + negative; + positive;).","completion":"Title: Disastrous Diving I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching Disastrous Diving, a poorly executed underwater adventure that fell short of creating any kind of gripping entertainment. To say that this film was disappointing would be an understatement. Right from the beginning, a myriad of issues surfaced, ranging from lackluster acting to paper-thin characterizations to glaring plot holes. The film, directed by the ill-suited Harrison Mudd, revolves around a group of divers who, after discovering a plausibly valuable maritime artifact, embark on a dangerous journey deep into the ocean, only to find their lives at risk. These characters, played by an evidently struggling ensemble cast, lack the charm, depth or emotional range required to evoke sympathy from the audience. Each subsequent scene feels like a desperate attempt to breathe life into the story, missing the mark entirely. The script is riddled with clichés and predictable moments, with unconvincing dialogue that never accurately conveys the peril of a hazardous dive. It becomes quite clear that the film's screenwriters failed to invest any meaningful time into researching the technical aspects of diving and ocean exploration. This oversight is evident in the multitude of inaccuracies and inconsistencies littered throughout the film. The ocean, with its immeasurable beauty and mystery, deserves to be the star of Disastrous Diving, but the film’s abysmal special effects and subpar cinematography significantly detract from the viewer’s experience. Sadly, what could have been a visually stunning film becomes a series of jarringly artificial underwater scenes. The film's lack of a convincing color palette or believable CGI truly exacerbates the flaws in an already crumbling narrative. Another frustrating aspect of Disastrous Diving is its poorly conceived and forgettable soundtrack, failing in its function to heighten the emotions or tension of a scene. Composer Alan Grover seemingly relied on uninspired, generic tunes that are maddeningly reminiscent of elevator music. In conclusion, Disastrous Diving is an utter failure. What could have been an immersive, heart-pounding underwater adventure becomes a lackluster attempt at storytelling marred by a weak script, unconvincing acting, and inadequate visual and auditory elements. It's disappointing to see the vast potential of such a captivating premise squandered on all counts.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Spirit, also known as MER-A (Mars Exploration Rover - A) or MER-2, is a robotic rover on Mars, active from 2004 to 2010. It was one of two rovers of NASA's ongoing Mars Exploration Rover Mission. It landed successfully on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. On January 21, 2004 (sol 17), Spirit abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. Spirit was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via X band to Mars Odyssey. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating - risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\\"Shutdown Dammit Until\\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command. The leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \\"reboot loop\\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the flash memory, the EEPROM, or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set - enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken. On sol 19 (January 24, 2004) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with Spirit's flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \\"not robust enough\\" for the operations the Spirit was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol 33), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed. What was the problem?","completion":"Okay little buddy, so Spirit, the robot on Mars, had a problem with its memory, kind of like when your toy gets confused and doesn't work right.

Examine the perspective: \\"Science can't produce faith.\\" This indicates that scientific knowledge and methods cannot create or strengthen religious beliefs. 3. Analyze whether the perspective supports or undermines the claim. In this case, the perspective suggests that there are certain human values, like faith, that science cannot address, determine, or impact. 4. Determine if the perspective is convincing enough for someone with a different view.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow.

Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, c. 1822 - March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped abolitionist John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry. By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted from slavery at the age of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted at the age of 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman. Around 1844, she married a free black man named John Tubman. Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages - free people of color marrying enslaved people - were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom. Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative.

Background: Nadia Elena Comaneci was born on November 12, 1961, in Onesti, which is a small town in the Carpathian Mountains, in Bacau County, Romania, in the historical region of Western Moldavia. Comaneci was born to Gheorghe and Stefania Comaneci, and has a younger brother. Her parents separated in the 1970s, and her father (1936-2012) later moved to Bucharest. She and her younger brother Adrian were raised in the faith of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Context: \\"At Montreal [Comaneci] received four of her seven 10s on the uneven bars. The apparatus demands such a spectacular burst of energy in such a short time--only 23 seconds--that it attracts the most fanfare. But it is on the beam that her work seems more representative of her unbelievable skill. She scored three of her seven 10s on the beam. Her hands speak there as much as her body. Her pace magnifies her balance. Her command and distance hush the crowd. On July 18, Comaneci made history at the 1976 Summer Olympics, when during the team compulsory portion of the competition, she was awarded the first perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics for her routine on the uneven bars. However, Omega SA--the traditional Olympics scoreboard manufacturer-- was led to believe that it was impossible to receive a perfect ten, thus the scoreboard was not programmed to display that score. Comaneci's perfect 10 thus appeared as \\"1.00,\\" the only means by which the judges could indicate that she had indeed received a 10. The crowd was at first confused, but soon understood and gave her a rousing ovation. During the remainder of the Montreal Games, Comaneci earned six additional tens. She won gold medals for the individual all-around, the balance beam and uneven bars. She also won a bronze for the floor exercise and a silver as part of the team all-around. Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim was her main rival during the Montreal Olympics; Kim became the second gymnast to receive a perfect ten for her performance on the vault. Comaneci also took over the spotlight from Olga Korbut, who had been the darling of the 1972 Munich Games. Comaneci's achievements are pictured in the entrance area of Madison Square Garden in New York City, where she is shown presenting her perfect beam exercise. Comaneci was the first Romanian gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. She also holds the record for being the youngest Olympic gymnastics all-around champion ever. The sport has now revised its age-eligibility requirements. Gymnasts must now turn 16 in the same calendar year of the Olympics to compete during the Games. When Comaneci competed in 1976, gymnasts had to be 14 by the first day of the competition. Legally breaking this record is not currently possible. She was the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year for 1976 and the Associated Press's 1976 \\"Female Athlete of the Year\\". Back home in Romania, Comaneci's success led her to be awarded the Sickle and Hammer Gold Medal, and named a Hero of Socialist Labor; she was the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during the administration of Nicolae Ceausescu. Question: Did she receive any metals or awards Answer:","completion":"Yes, Nadia Comaneci received several medals and awards throughout her career.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work? OPTIONS: + people were going back to school to learn open source + OpenAdvantage was hiring all the workers + not enough information + industry was being automated and moved to Asia The answer is:","completion":"industry was being automated and moved to Asia. A lot of Midlanders were out of work due to the automation of industries and the relocation of jobs to Asia where production costs were likely lower. This significant change in the job market led to an increasing number of people seeking new opportunities and looking to retrain themselves in emerging technologies such as open source software. OpenAdvantage was established as a response to this situation, providing free consultancy and upskilling services for both businesses and individuals hoping to benefit from the growing influence of open source technology in various fields. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and automation, the need to retrain and transform the workforce into knowledge workers becomes crucial. The experience of OpenAdvantage and the situation in the West Midlands serve as valuable examples of how government, academic institutions, and organizations can collaborate to create opportunities for people who have lost their jobs due to technological development. Retraining the workforce as knowledge workers in the age of AI requires a multi-pronged approach. Here are some recommendations based on previous experiences and observations: 1. Assess industry trends and demands: Governments, academic institutions, and businesses should assess the demands of the knowledge economy, identify the skills required, and plan the appropriate training and educational programs accordingly. 2. Collaboration between stakeholders: Establish partnerships between government entities, educational institutions, and industry to develop comprehensive training programs that cater to the emerging knowledge workforce. 3. Accessible education and training: Make education and training easily accessible for individuals who wish to switch their careers and enter the knowledge economy. Consider offering free courses, online learning platforms, and financial support to facilitate the transition. 4. Develop transferable skills: Focus on developing transferable skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and adaptability, which are essential in the knowledge economy, as well as being applicable across various industries and fields. 5. Encourage lifelong learning: Promote a culture of lifelong learning where individuals continually upgrade their skills and knowledge in response to the evolving job market. This will help workers stay competitive and relevant in a constantly changing work environment. 6. Support network and mentorship: Build a community and support network for individuals undergoing career transitions. Connect seasoned professionals who have successfully retrained as knowledge workers with those seeking to follow a similar path. 7. Monitor and measure progress: Regularly assess the effectiveness of retraining programs and update them based on industry trends, technological advancements, and feedback from participants. This will ensure that workforce development initiatives remain relevant and effective in preparing people for the knowledge economy. In conclusion, retraining the workforce as knowledge workers in the age of AI is both a challenge and an opportunity. By focusing on collaboration, accessible education, transferable skills, lifelong learning, support networks, and systematic monitoring, stakeholders can effectively facilitate the transformation of the workforce and better prepare individuals for the demands of the knowledge economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who did Joe Denton give a ride to? Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey. At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son.

When did kings grant privileges to the nobles?","completion":"Kings in Poland granted privileges to the nobles primarily during two key instances, both of which played a significant part in the political, social, and economic fabric of the country. These privileges were essential in maintaining a delicate balance of power between the monarch and the nobility, and were instrumental in shaping the course of Polish history. 1. At the time of their election to the throne: In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unique elective monarchy system was in place from around 1386 until 1791. During this period, when a new king was to be elected, the nobility had a significant say in the process. As a part of the election proceedings, the king-elect would enter into an agreement called the \\"Pacta Conventa,\\" in which he would commit to respect and uphold the rights, privileges, and liberties of the nobility. Some of the privileges granted to the nobles during this time could include tax exemptions, self-government, and control over local administration. These privileges were seen as essential by the king-elect in securing the support of the nobles, as their goodwill and loyalty were necessary to ensure a stable rule. 2. At other times, in exchange for ad hoc permission to raise an extraordinary tax or a pospolite ruszenie: Apart from the election time, Polish kings would often find themselves needing the cooperation of the nobility to address various challenges faced by the kingdom, such as wars, large-scale infrastructure projects, or other significant political issues. The monarch would then grant privileges to the nobles in exchange for their ad hoc permission to raise additional financial resources in the form of extraordinary taxes or a pospolite ruszenie, which was a form of feudal levy or conscription of armed forces from among the noble class. By doing so, the Polish kings sought to solicit the support and resources of their subjects in return for preserving and enhancing the noble class's rights and privileges. In summary, Polish kings granted privileges to the nobles both at the time of their election to the throne and at other times when they needed their support for specific purposes, such as collecting extra resources, taxes, or armies. These practices were critical in ensuring a stable and cooperative relationship between the monarch and the nobility, and played a substantial role in the political development of Poland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right...

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

The band was formed in 2003 and recorded its first EP, Translating the Name, that same year original vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, Cove Reber replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. The group recorded its self titled debut album which was released on Capitol Records on September 26, 2006. The original lineup for Saosin, consisting of Burchell, Shekoski, Kennedy and Green, was formed in the summer of 2003. On June 17, the band released their first commercial production, the EP Translating the Name. It was an immediate success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites. Saosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the Internet. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as MySpace. The E.P. has sold an estimated 62,000 copies. Bassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art. He was later replaced by Chris Sorenson.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\".

This action indicates Kendall's trust in Jesse and her willingness to share her story or experience behind the scar. In this scenario, it would make sense for Kendall to want Jesse to gently stroke the scar, showing empathy and understanding while acknowledging her vulnerability.

The right hand is traditionally considered a symbol of strength, dexterity, and proficiency, while the left hand is often seen as weaker and less precise. By associating these qualities with the heart, the proverb emphasizes a connection between wisdom or foolishness and one's actions and character. The statement urges individuals to strive for wisdom and make prudent choices based on knowledge and understanding. A wise person's heart embodies intelligence, caution, and sound judgment, which leads to success and happiness. In contrast, a fool's heart reflects ignorance, impulsiveness, and faulty decision-making, which often results in failure and misery. Given the significance of the heart as the core of one's being and the source of emotions and desires, it is crucial for an individual to cultivate wisdom and develop a strong moral compass. A heart at the right hand signifies a well-balanced, mature, and responsible individual who is equipped to face life's challenges and make sound decisions. In everyday applications, this statement may be applied to various situations in which an individual must act wisely and avoid foolishness. For example, a wise person will carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits before making an important decision, while a fool will likely act without weighing the consequences or considering alternative options. Similarly, a wise individual will listen to and learn from others, while a fool will stubbornly persist in his or her own ignorance. Overall, the message of Ecclesiastes 10:2 is that wisdom should guide our thoughts, emotions, and actions. By nurturing a wise heart, an individual can develop the skills and insights necessary to navigate life's complex challenges and make meaningful contributions to society. Conversely, a foolish heart can lead one astray, resulting in the mistakes and poor choices that result in personal and collective suffering. In conclusion, the proverb \\"A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart is at his left\\" serves as a reminder of the importance of striving for wisdom and pursuing personal growth. By doing so, we can ensure that our hearts remain firmly anchored on the right side – guided by knowledge, understanding, and a deep sense of integrity."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Devika Rani Chaudhuri, usually known as Devika Rani (30 March 1908 - 9 March 1994), was an actress in Indian films who was active during the 1930s and 1940s. Widely acknowledged as the first lady of Indian cinema, Devika Rani had a successful film career that spanned 10 years. Born into a wealthy, anglicized Indian family, Devika Rani was sent to boarding school in England at age nine and grew up in that country. In 1928, she met Himanshu Rai, an Indian film-producer, and married him the following year. Devika Rani Chaudhuri was born into a Bengali family in Waltair near Visakhapatnam in present-day Andhra Pradesh, into an extremely affluent and educated Bengali family. Her father, Colonel Manmatha Nath Chaudhuri, was the first Indian Surgeon-General of Madras Presidency and a nephew of Rabindranath Tagore. Her mother, Leela Devi Choudhary, came from an educated family and was a grand-niece of Tagore. Devika's father's brothers were Ashutosh Chaudhuri, Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri, a prominent Kolkata-based barrister and Pramatha Chaudhuri, the famous Bengali writer. Devika Rani was related through both her parents to the poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Her father, Manmathnath Choudhary, was the son of Sukumari Devi Choudhary, sister of Rabindranath Tagore. Devika's mother, Leela Devi Chaudhuri, was the daughter of Indumati Devi Chattopadhyay, whose mother Saudamini Devi Gangopadhyay was another sister of the Nobel laureate. Devika's father and maternal grandmothers were first cousins to each other, being the children of two sisters of Rabindranath Tagore. Further, two of her father's brothers had also married their cousins: Prativa Devi Choudhury, wife of Ashutosh Choudhary, was the daughter of Hemendranath Tagore, and Indira Devi Choudhary, wife of Promatho Choudhary, was the daughter of Satyendranath Tagore. Devika thus had strong ties to Jarasanko, seat of the Tagore family in Kolkata and a major crucible of the Bengali renaissance. Devika Rani was sent to boarding school in England at the age of nine, and grew up there. After completing her schooling in the mid-1920s, she enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music. She also enrolled for courses in architecture, textile and decor design, and even apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden.

Choices: - discovery - estimation - consideration - observation A: Answer:","completion":"The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The scientific method is a standard approach utilized by scientists in various disciplines to explore phenomena, answer questions, and develop new knowledge. This systematic, logical, and objective method involves a series of well-defined steps that enable researchers to gain a deep understanding of the cause and effect relationships in various phenomena. The key steps in the scientific method include: 1. Asking Questions: Any scientific inquiry starts with a question or observation about a specific phenomenon. This initial inquiry serves as the foundation for the entire research process. 2. Background Research: After identifying a research question, the next step involves conducting extensive background research. This includes reviewing existing theories, published literature, and established knowledge to better understand the context of the problem. 3. Developing a Hypothesis: Based on the background research, a hypothesis is formulated. A hypothesis is an informed and testable assumption that explains the possible relationship between variables or predicts the outcome of an experiment. 4. Designing and Conducting Experiments: To test the validity of the hypothesis, researchers design and conduct experiments, ensuring they are controlled, and variables are manipulated as needed. The experiments should be carefully planned and replicable, allowing for accurate measurements and data collection. 5. Careful Observation: This step emphasizes the importance of systematically observing, recording, and analyzing the data collected during the experiments. Accurate and detailed observations are crucial in ensuring that the findings are valid and reliable. 6. Analyzing Data and Drawing Conclusions: Once the data has been collected, it is analyzed to determine trends, relationships, and patterns. The results are then interpreted and evaluated to either support or disprove the hypothesis. 7. Reporting Findings: Scientists must communicate and share their findings with the scientific community by writing comprehensive research papers, attending conferences, and engaging in discussions. This helps advance knowledge, allows for external validation, and encourages further research. 8. Replication and Further Research: One of the key aspects of the scientific method is that experiments should be replicable to verify the validity of the results. Further research is also encouraged to refine and expand on the initial findings. In conclusion, the scientific method is a rigorous and structured method of research that involves carefully planned and controlled experiments, as well as meticulous observation of the data collected. By utilizing these established steps, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena they are studying, make informed conclusions, and contribute valuable knowledge to their respective fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who was known as the Mummy of Birchin Bower? ? Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

Article: When you consider what subject to study in college, chances are that you and your parents will think about what you can make out of _ after graduation. You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature , history, cultural studies and philosophy, do not prepare students for a specific vocation . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School. Even those who choose a liberal arts education often pick the humanities subject which they think will best help them later find a job. \\"I'm going to study Spanish in college, which I believe will open doors to a high-paying job for me,\\" said Liu Chao, 18, a Senior 2 student at Dalian No 20 High School. He said few of his classmates show interest in subjects like philosophy and history, which are seen as \\"less promising\\" in job markets. The popularity of liberal arts subjects among college students has also been decreasing in the United States. American scholars and universities are concerned that in the ongoing economic crisis liberal arts subjects will be hit hardest. As money tightens , they worry that the humanities may become \\"a great luxury that many cannot afford\\", according to the New York Times. Question: What can we infer from the passage ? - Humanities are becoming less and less popular with the students. - Studying science subjects is sure to find a well-paid job. - The humanities in college should be cancelled. - The writer thinks those who choose the liberal arts education will choose their favorite subjects.

'' Hypothesis: Sir Oliver was not afraid.","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, the hypothesis that Sir Oliver was not afraid cannot be conclusively determined as true. Here's an analysis of the text to support this conclusion: 1. Sir Oliver's first glance at the arrow and his reaction to the dark hue of it touching him with \\"some fear\\" suggests that he might have initially been afraid of the unknown element associated with the arrow or its purpose. 2. However, when he reads the word \\"Earthed\\" on the arrow, he responds confidently, \\"Ay, they know I am home, then. Earthed! Ay, but there is not a dog among them fit to dig me out.\\" This statement shows that Sir Oliver is aware that someone might be after him, but he feels secure and confident in his ability to face whatever threat they pose. 3. When Sir Oliver scrambles to his feet, there is no mention of any lingering fear or worry. Instead, he seems to be back in control of the situation and addresses Sir Daniel. In conclusion, while Sir Oliver might have experienced a brief moment of fear, it is unclear whether this fear was just a fleeting reaction or a deeper, ongoing emotion. Therefore, the hypothesis that \\"Sir Oliver was not afraid\\" cannot be definitively deemed true based on the information from the paragraph."},{"prompt":"Process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Health problems come: Options: A. before one recognizes the symptoms B. during fetal development C. after aging D. not enough information","completion":"C. after aging"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr. Michael Tan, handled this claim. When Mr. Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine. Mr. Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend this contractor again. He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment. Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy. Consequently, I wrote to Mr. Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman. Mr. Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail. He later reported back to me that Mr. Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear. This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise. When I received Mr. Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained. If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr. Ashe's charges. Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr. Ashe. I believed this claim was handled badly by Mr. Tan from the beginning. Therefore, a great deal of embarrassment has been caused over this issue. I felt you should know how disappointed and upset I am. I trust you will look into this and ensure that such claims are handled more appropriately in the future. Yours sincerely, ...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. OPT: [A]. Yes; [B]. No; Q: Ash and Jordan have been in a relationship for 2 years and love each other very much. Given the question \\"What will Ash want to do next?\\", is \\"Ignore Jordan\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"A: No, \\"Ignore Jordan\\" is not a valid answer in this context. As Ash and Jordan have been in a loving relationship for 2 years, it is unlikely that Ash would want to ignore Jordan without a substantial reason. In any relationship, communication and understanding are key to maintaining a healthy bond between two individuals. If Ash truly loves Jordan and values their relationship, it would be more plausible to assume that Ash would continue engaging with Jordan in various activities such as spending quality time together, sharing personal thoughts, and exploring new experiences. Ignoring a loved one is generally considered a negative action within a relationship and could lead to feelings of disconnect, confusion, or resentment. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that people may have different opinions, emotions, and reasons that influence their actions – thus, without further contextual information, it is impossible to predict with certainty what Ash would want to do next regarding their relationship. To provide a more valid answer, consider the following questions that can help better understand Ash's motivations and potential actions: 1. What is the current state of Ash and Jordan's relationship? Are they facing any challenges or major changes in their lives that may influence Ash's behavior? 2. What are Ash's own feelings, goals, and dreams? Are these aligned with their relationship with Jordan, or do they face personal struggles that may affect Ash's response within their relationship? 3. How is the balance within the relationship? Are Ash and Jordan supportive of each other, or is there a need for a conversation to address any issues or misunderstandings? 4. Are there any external factors that could influence Ash's actions, such as stress from work, family, or social circles? If so, it may be crucial to consider how these factors impact Ash's thoughts and behaviors. In conclusion, relationships are complex and dynamic, requiring ongoing effort from both individuals. The answer \\"Ignore Jordan\\" is not a valid response given the premise of a loving two-year relationship between Ash and Jordan. To better understand and predict Ash's actions, consider various factors influencing their relationship and individual feelings, and promote open communication and understanding between the two partners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing? Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell. Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began. Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence. A stalemate persisted, with regular exchanges of cannon fire, until September 21, when 100...

Scientists looking for new cures often visit traditional healers. They find out what plants are used in healing. Then they look at what the plant contains. They find the active ingredient , which is the chemical in the plant that works to heal. Many of the drugs we use, including aspirin, have come from these natural medicines. In recent years, many people in the US have taking what are legally known as dietary supplements . They may be vitamins or minerals. They may be herbs that help with health problems, such as depression. Some of them are teas. Others are capsules or tablets. They are sold in natural food stores, drug stores, and groceries. Most people think that because these products are natural they are also safe. This is not always true. There are many plants that are poisonous. There are others that have bad side effects. The New England Journal of Medicine publishes medical research. A recent edition called for the government to _ dietary supplements. Several doctors wrote to the Journal and told of bad experiences people have had with dietary supplements. Dietary supplements aren't tested in the same way as drugs. There is not always proof that the supplement really does what it is supposed to do. There is also a problem with purity of the supplements. Supplements have been found to contain things that are bad for the body. For example, the California Department of Health found that of 260 herbs grown in China, one third contained heavy metals.

Iran: 44 die as two buses collide State television in Iran has said 44 people were killed when two buses collided head-on The accident between two intercity services happened late on Monday on a road south of the country's capital, Tehran, it was reported. One of the buses swerved into the opposite lane due to a flat tire, colliding head-on with the other bus. Both caught fire. The report said another 44 injured people were taken to hospital in the city of Qom, about 80 miles (130km) south of Tehran. Iran has one of the worst road safety records in the world. Statistics say more than 20,000 people lose their lives in road accidents every year in the country. The high toll is blamed on disregard of traffic rules, unsafe roads and poor emergency services. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In Iran, two buses crashed into each other because one of them had a flat tire and went into the wrong lane. This sad accident caused 44 people to pass away and another 44 people got hurt. They were taken to the hospital. Iran has many accidents like this because their roads aren't very safe and people don't always follow the traffic rules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that scholars have been covering up the crimes of the artist, but does not specify the reason for this action. Step 3: Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees or necessarily implies the truth of another statement. If the premise is true, this means that scholars indeed have been covering up the crimes of the artist with the intention of protecting him from justice. Consequently, the hypothesis, which merely states that scholars have been covering up the crimes of the artist, must also be true. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"Scholars have been covering up the crimes of the artist.\\" The hypothesis is a more general statement that is necessarily implied by the premise, considering it asserts the same action (covering up the crimes) but without specifying the reason for this action."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite its length, clocking in at nearly forty minutes and stretched over six parts, the track made the UK top 30, and previewed what was to come. In 1994, they released Lifeforms to critical acclaim. The album featured unconventional use of percussion interspersed with ambient segments. The eponymous single from the album featured Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals. The album itself featured epic, ambient soundscapes, with tracks flowing from one to the next with no pauses in between. Throughout the record, familiar motifs and samples repeated themselves, sitting alongside tropical birdsong, rainfall, wind and an array of other exotic sounds, lending the album a natural, organic feel, backed up by the environmental landscapes that filled the artwork booklet. Brian Dougan's father was involved with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which was a heavy influence in the almost musique concrete feel to Lifeforms. The album was also a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. Cobain has said that around this time that journalists would come to talk to them and one of the first things they would ask would be if they liked Brian Eno (whom they cite as an influence), to which they would laugh and say that they were about looking forward, not to the past. It was, to them, very much a new work rather than just another Eno-type ambient album. We wanted to release a very immersive, mind-blowing piece of music that was long and would deeply drench you in it...Lifeforms was redefining 'classical ambient electronic experimental' - that was the phrase we used. That year, they released the limited edition album ISDN, which featured live broadcasts they had made over ISDN lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote Lifeforms, including The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance space in New York and several appearances on the late John Peel's celebrated BBC radio Sessions shows. These shows marked the evolution of the Kiss FM shows of 1992 and 1993, moving away from DJ sets and into ambient soundscapes, with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One live performance to BBC Radio 1 featured Robert Fripp performing alongside the band. The released album's tone was darker and more rhythmic than Lifeforms. Cobain stated that with ISDN they had wanted to achieve something epic and grand but no matter how much technological or personal support they had (and they had everything they could have possibly wanted) they never got to truly do what they envisioned; he admits to wanting too much at this time, even though the album was successful; the 90s, for Cobain in particular, were a time of frustration and feelings of not being able to do what they wanted to, because the technology at the time didn't fit the band's ideas. The following year, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list as an unlimited pressing.

Then, pull the plastic away from the cheese until the entire outer wrapping has been removed. Discard the plastic. Place the tip of the knife at the center of the wheel. Make a straight cut from the center to the outside edge of the cheese wheel. Then, place the tip of the knife back in the center and move the blade so it’s at about a 45-degree angle from the first cut you made. Slice down into the cheese wheel and make another cut. Remove the wedge from the cheese wheel. Wrap the rest of the gouda in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. Some wheels of gouda come with a red or black wax coating that needs to removed before the cheese can be eaten. If your wheel of gouda has one, peel the wax on each wedge back with your fingers or a knife. Discard the wax pieces after you remove them. Divide each wedge up into 4 or 5 even horizontal slices. Take the end piece near the rind (the hardened outer part of the cheese) and cut it in half crosswise to make 2 pieces. The rind on the cheese is edible, so leave it on when you're cutting up the cheese. If you don't want to eat the rind, eat around it and discard it when you're finished. Place a grater over a plate or bowl. Hold the wedge of gouda in your hand and gently rub it down the sharp perforated side of the grater. Once you reach the bottom, lift the wedge of cheese off the grater, bring it back to the top, and rub it down the side of the grater again. Repeat until the whole wedge has been grated. Keep your fingers away from the grater while you're grating the cheese. Summary:","completion":"This is about how to cut and grate a wheel of gouda cheese. First, take off the plastic or wax coating.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

Among them there was a big basket of very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop. \\"I'd like a kilogram of this kind of fruit, please,\\" he said to the shop keeper. After the keeper gave him the fruit, he began to eat some of it. \\"Oh, my God!\\" he shouted. His eyes watered, his mouth watered; his eyes were burning, his head was burning; and his face became red. As he coughed, he jumped up and down, saying, \\"Ah! Ah! Ah!\\" But he still kept eating the fruit! Some people looking at him and said, \\"You're crazy, man. Those are chilies ! You can't eat so many; they're not good for you! People use them as a _ , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them like that; they're not fruit!\\" But the man said, \\"No, I can't stop! I paid money for them. It's my money!\\" Sometimes we do a lot of things like that. We still continue just because we've put money, time, effort and love into it.

In this story, the man's motivation for continuing to eat the chilies despite the pain and discomfort is his desire not to waste the money he had spent on them. This demonstrates how people might continue to engage in a particular behavior or action, even if it is causing them harm or discomfort, simply because they have already invested resources such as money, time, effort, and love into it. This phenomenon is known as the \\"sunk cost fallacy,\\" where people make decisions based on the amount of resources they have already invested, rather than evaluating the current and future value of their actions. It is important to recognize when we are falling into the trap of the sunk cost fallacy and to make decisions based on the potential value and benefits of our actions, rather than clinging to the past investments we have made. In the case of the man in the story, it would have been more rational for him to stop eating the chilies after realizing they were not meant to be eaten in large quantities, despite the money he had spent on them. Instead, he let the sunk cost of his purchase dominate his decision-making, leading to unnecessary pain and suffering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

This act can be seen as an effort by North Korea to build trust and establish a positive atmosphere for the upcoming talks.

Given the following context: While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions. answer the following question: What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own?

Short movie review: the truly funny bits Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic seems to be thinking positively about the movie, as they mention \\"the truly funny bits.\\" This suggests that there were some genuinely funny moments in the film that the critic appreciated or enjoyed. However, it is important to note that this is just a single phrase from the review, and there might be other aspects of the movie that the critic did not enjoy as much. In a more detailed analysis of the critic's opinion, we can assume the following: 1. The critic found parts of the movie to be genuinely funny, which indicates that the comedic aspects of the film were effective. This is a positive aspect of their opinion, as humor is often an essential element of many movies. 2. The use of the word \\"truly\\" in \\"truly funny bits\\" suggests that these moments stood out amongst other potentially humorous moments in the movie. It implies that these particular instances were of high quality and genuine, making them memorable and enjoyable to watch. 3. However, the phrasing could also suggest that only certain moments were funny, and the critic might not have found the entire movie to be consistently humorous. This could imply that there might be some inconsistency in the comedy throughout the film, with occasional genuinely funny moments surrounded by less effective attempts at humor. While it is difficult to determine the overall opinion of the critic based on this short sentence alone, it seems that they did, at least, find some humor in the movie. This positivity towards the film's comedy gives us reason to believe that the critic might lean towards a positive opinion of the movie overall.
