There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \\"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\\" said Jake Hess. \\"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.

If you use thicker PVC pipe (like ¾” or 1”) the frame will be sturdier and you may not need this bracing. Look in any store that sells fabric for a bright green color of natural or synthetic fabric that won't wrinkle easily. Purchase at least 2-3 yards of fabric that is 48 inches wide or wider. Note that a standard width for fabric is 48 inches, or 4 feet. If you want a green screen wider than that, look for fabric that comes in a 54\\" or 60” width, or sew two pieces of fabric together for an even larger size. It’s also a good idea to iron your fabric so that it is free of wrinkles before use as a green screen. Visible wrinkles that show up on camera will interfere with the keying process that replaces the color with another image. If you cannot find a suitable green color of fabric, you may be able to paint or dye fabric to your desired shade. However, this method may not turn out as even or consistent as a pre-dyed fabric.

It gives assurance that one is not obliged to make a purchase while requesting a quote. Also attached to the term \\"chat\\", reaffirming the company's commitment to discuss customer needs without the pressure of obligation. - \\"quote\\": This noun is the object of the sentence, the thing that's being requested. A quote refers to a price estimate given by a company or service provider. - \\"here\\": This adverb is indicating the place where users can request the quote, the 'here' probably refers to a webpage or a direct chat interface. - \\"or\\": This conjunction is used to link different possibilities. In context, it's providing an alternative option for the reader. - \\"contact\\": This verb prompts the reader to get in touch with the service provider in some way, serving as another call to action. - \\"us\\": This pronoun refers to the service provider or company that's offering the no-obligation quote or chat about customer needs. - \\"for\\": This preposition is used to indicate the purpose or function of something. It connects 'contact us' with what the user will get out of contacting, which is a 'no-obligation chat'. - \\"chat\\": This noun refers to an informal conversation or discussion, which in this context refers to a discussion about customer needs. - \\"about\\": This preposition is used to express location in a metaphorical sense. It introduces the topic of the chat - the users' needs. - \\"your\\": This possessive adjective is used to describe something as belonging to or associated with the reader. - \\"needs\\": The reader's requirements or necessities that they're looking to address or fulfill.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Definition: Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them. The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random.

How do you do this: How can I safely melt two plastics together?","completion":"Melting two plastics together can be a tricky process, especially if you're aiming to do it safely and effectively to create a strong bond. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you safely melt two plastics together: 1. Identify the type of plastics you're working with: Plastics come in various types, such as ABS, PLA, PET, PVC, HDPE, etc. It's crucial to know which types you're working with because different plastics have different melting points and require specific handling techniques. You can typically find this information on the label, embossed on the plastic, or by looking up the product specifications. 2. Gather the necessary equipment: To perform the melting process safely, ensure you have the following tools and safety gear: - Heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands from burns - Safety goggles to protect your eyes from debris and harmful fumes - A well-ventilated area or a respirator mask to mitigate the risk of inhaling toxic fumes - A heat source compatible with the type of plastic you're working with, such as a soldering iron, plastic welder, or hot air gun - A non-flammable work surface 3. Prepare the plastic surfaces: Clean both plastic surfaces thoroughly to remove any dirt, oil, or debris that may interfere with the bonding process. This could involve using soap and water, rubbing alcohol, or in some cases a specialized plastic cleaner. 4. Heat the plastic: Keeping safety precautions in mind, turn on your heat source and let it reach the required temperature. Generally, most plastics have a melting temperature range between 200°F and 400°F (93°C to 204°C), but be sure to reference the specific melting temperature for the plastic types you're working with. 5. Apply heat evenly: Slowly and carefully, apply heat to both plastic surfaces you wish to join. Be sure to distribute the heat evenly for a consistent and reliable bond. Remember to wear your safety gear and work in a well-ventilated area. 6. Join the plastics together: Once both surfaces have reached their melting point and are softened, apply mild pressure to bring the plastics together. It's essential to maintain contact until the melted sections cool and harden, solidifying the bond. You may use clamps or a vice to hold the pieces together if needed. 7. Optional reinforcement: In some cases, you may choose to use a filler rod made from the same type of plastic to add strength and reinforcement to the joined area. When applying the filler rod, heat it using the heat source until it becomes molten and can easily be pushed into the seam where the two plastic pieces are joined. Smooth out the filler rod to ensure a proper bond. 8. Allow the plastics to cool: Once the plastics have been successfully melted and joined, it's essential to let them cool and harden completely. Patience is key during this step, as premature handling of the joined plastics can lead to a weakened bond or damage to the materials. 9. Inspect the bond: After the melted plastic has cooled and hardened, be sure to inspect the bond for strength and consistency. If you notice any inconsistencies, flaws, or weak spots, you may need to repeat the process or consider using a different method like adhesive bonding or mechanical fastening. Please note that the process may vary depending on the specific type of plastic you're working with. Always consult the material specifications and follow the appropriate guidelines for safe handling and processing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Югославия на зимних Олимпийских играх 1948 Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"\\"Yugoslavia at the 1948 Winter Olympic Games\\" The phrase is a reference to the participation of the former country of Yugoslavia in the Winter Olympic Games held in 1948. The 1948 Winter Olympics, also known as the V Olympic Winter Games, took place in St. Moritz, Switzerland, from January 30 to February 8. Yugoslavia, a socialist state in Southeast Europe that existed from 1929 until 2003, had a rich history of participation in various sports events, including the Winter Olympic Games. Though the country eventually dissolved into several successor states (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia), its athletes' accomplishments during the Yugoslav period are still remembered and celebrated today. In the 1948 Winter Olympics, Yugoslavia sent a team of 19 athletes to compete in several sports disciplines such as alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and ice hockey. These athletes represented their country with pride and contributed to the rich legacy of Yugoslav sports achievements. Some interesting facts about Yugoslavia at the 1948 Winter Olympic Games are: 1. This was the first time Yugoslavia participated in the Winter Olympics. The country previously competed in the Summer Olympics, starting with the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium. 2. Although Yugoslavia did not win any medals in the 1948 Winter Olympics, several athletes recorded noteworthy performances and personal bests. 3. One of the most notable Yugoslav athletes at the 1948 Winter Olympics was ski jumper Božo Tomašević. He became the first Yugoslav athlete to compete in ski jumping at the Winter Olympics, finishing 45th in the individual event. 4. In ice hockey, Yugoslavia finished in 9th place, defeating the Austrian team in their final match during the tournament. 5. Female figure skater Metka Potočnik, who participated in the individual women's competition, became one of the earliest female Olympians representing Yugoslavia. While Yugoslavia did not secure any medals during the 1948 Winter Olympic Games, the event marked the beginning of a long and storied history of Winter Olympic participation for the country and its successor states. Subsequent Winter Olympic Games saw these athletes improve their standings, achieving medals and memorable milestones that showcased their dedication, talent, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Countries emerging from the dissolution of Yugoslavia, like Slovenia and Croatia, continued participating in the Winter Olympics, building upon the legacy left behind by the Yugoslav athletes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: \\"A man in plaid shorts and a blue t-shirt stands in front of a stack of boxes in front of a Pizza from Naples store.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The man is singing to a woman\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"A man in plaid shorts and a blue t-shirt stands in front of a stack of boxes in front of a Pizza from Naples store,\\" we cannot definitively determine whether the hypothesis is true or not. The premise provides a description of the man's appearance and location, but it does not provide any information about his actions or the presence of a woman. To analyze the premise in more detail, let's break it down into its key components: 1. A man is present. 2. The man is wearing plaid shorts and a blue t-shirt. 3. The man is standing in front of a stack of boxes. 4. The man is in front of a Pizza from Naples store. In contrast, the hypothesis contains information that is not mentioned or described in the premise: 1. The man is singing. 2. A woman is present. 3. The man is singing to the woman. As you can see, there is a clear disconnect between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise only gives us information about the man's attire and his location, while the hypothesis concerns the actions of the man, the presence of a woman, and the interaction between them. Since the premise does not provide any data that supports or contradicts the hypothesis, we cannot determine its truth or falsehood based solely on the information given in the premise. Therefore, it is crucial to gather more information and contextual details to assess whether the hypothesis is true or not. For example, if we had additional observational data indicating that the man was indeed singing and directing his performance towards a nearby woman, the hypothesis would be better substantiated.

Article: Researchers have found more evidence that suggests a relationship between races and rates of lung cancer among smokers. A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year research studied more than 180,000 people. They included present and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study are reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites are the heaviest smokers. But the scientists point out that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Scientists know that some diseases effect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients. The name is BiDil. The agency called it \\"a step toward the promise of personalized medicine.\\" Question: Which of the following orders is from higher to lower risk of having lung cancer?

A:","completion":"To determine which piece of land has a higher filtration capacity, we need to consider the soil properties of both lands. Step 1: Examine the soil types Jim's land has clay soil, while Bob's land has very fertile soil (which is most likely loam or silt). Step 2: Assess soil's relation to filtration capacity Clay soil tends to have low permeability due to its small particle size and tightly packed structure. This results in slow water infiltration and reduced filtration capacity. On the other hand, fertile soils like loam or silt generally have better permeability and water holding capacity, which leads to higher filtration capacity. Step 3: Consider the effect of pH on filtration capacity Jim's land has a high pH, which could potentially affect the availability of certain nutrients in the soil.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The answer to the question: What did the Tibetans capture in 678? is inside the article: Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"In 678, the Tibetans captured the Silk Road from the Tang dynasty of China. The Silk Road was an important trade route, connecting China to Europe and the Western world. This capture led to the closure of the Silk Road for some time, impacting trade and the exchange of ideas and cultures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - More than once a week. - Most times that macaroni and cheese is served. - not enough information - Usually at lunch time. Answer:","completion":"Not enough information The preference for calorie-dense and high-salt foods can vary greatly between individuals, depending on their upbringing, culture, personal taste preferences, and exposure to different types of foods through their lifetime. Additionally, the frequency of consumption of such foods can also be influenced by factors like socioeconomic status, availability, accessibility, and marketing of high-salt and calorie-dense foods. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific frequency or mealtime when individuals with a preference for calorie-dense diets would consume high salt foods without more information about their background and habits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bush, in which he addresses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his statement, President Bush urges Israel to halt the expansion of settlements in the occupied territories and put an end to the daily suffering and humiliation faced by the Palestinian people. He also emphasizes the importance of democratic reform within the Palestinian community to reach a resolution for the ongoing conflict. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a longstanding political and territorial dispute between the state of Israel and the Palestinians, primarily centered around issues such as borders, refugees, security, and the legal and political status of Jerusalem. Settlements are Israeli civilian communities built on lands occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, which include the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. These settlements have been a major point of contention between both parties, as they are viewed as illegal under international law and a major hurdle to the peace process. In calling for a \\"freeze\\" on settlements, President Bush is essentially requesting that Israel stops the expansion and establishment of new settlements in these disputed territories. By doing so, he hopes to facilitate negotiation and compromise between the two parties, leading to a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Furthermore, President Bush also addresses the need for the Palestinians to commit to democratic reform. Achieving a stable, transparent, and accountable governing system is vital for fostering peace and building trust between Israelis and Palestinians.

Here are possible answers to this question: - breathe - experience sadness - forget nothing - remember everything - to get food I believe the correct choice is \\"remember everything\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier, and the correct choice for the reason behind this action is \\"remember everything.\\" Elephants are known for their exceptional memory and cognitive abilities, which sets them apart from many other animal species. This unique trait has been the subject of much fascination and scientific study, as researchers continue to explore the intricacies of the elephant's brain and its advanced capacity for remembering information. One of the main reasons why the elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier is to display its remarkable ability to remember everything. Studies have shown that elephants can remember not only numbers but also faces, scents, locations, and events. This ability of elephants plays a crucial role in their survival and social interactions. In the wild, elephants rely on their extraordinary memory to guide them to water and food sources, which might be seasonal and scarce. Remembering the locations of these resources and the best migration routes helps elephants conserve energy and optimize their resource utilization. Additionally, the matriarchs of elephant herds, who are responsible for leading the group, possess vast knowledge of their environment and share this information with younger generations, contributing to group cohesion and collective memory. Furthermore, elephants also exhibit strong emotional intelligence, allowing them to remember and recognize members of their family, as well as the bonds they share with other individuals. They can form lasting friendships and grieve the death of their loved ones. This ability to remember other elephants and their relationships with them is crucial for maintaining social order within the herd. Asking the elephant to recall a number mentioned earlier serves as a demonstration of its cognitive prowess. The prime reasoning behind this action is to showcase the elephant's exceptional ability to remember everything, highlighting its unique status among animals. The other options provided, such as breathe, experience sadness, forget nothing, and to get food, although related to various aspects of an elephant's life, do not accurately explain why the elephant was asked to recall the number. Remembering everything is the most fitting reason, as it emphasizes the elephant's distinct cognitive abilities and illustrates its remarkable memory, which is crucial for the survival, social structure, and emotional wellbeing of these majestic creatures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The vessel, which had been conducting China's 30th Antarctic expedition before going to the aid of the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy, will now continue with its scheduled activities. The trapped Russian ship was also trying to free itself on Tuesday, with the favorable west wind loosening the surrounding ice, according to CCTV. A helicopter onboard Xuelong _ 52 passengers onboard Akademik Shokalskiy to an Australian vessel on Thursday. The Russian ship had been stuck in the ice for 10 days. However, Xuelong became trapped during the rescue effort, with the ice surrounding the vessel three to four meters thick, far beyond the ship's ice-breaking capability. Qu Tanzhou, director of the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration under the State Oceanic Administration, told China Daily via telephone on Tuesday that Xuelong's attempts at the breakout started on Tuesday morning. \\"A west wind is blowing on Tuesday, as we expected, which makes the floes and ice surrounding Xuelong more loose , creating favorable conditions for sailing on Wednesday,\\" Qu said.

Step 2: Choose the method From the two options provided, I would choose \\"dry with several tennis balls\\" because tennis balls help to evenly distribute the tumbling force throughout the drying cycle, allowing the pillow material to fluff without bunching up or clumping together. Furthermore, tennis balls can also help to shorten the drying time, making it an efficient option. Step 3: Insert pillows and tennis balls Place the pillows in the dryer, ensuring that they have enough room to tumble freely. For added efficiency, you may put 3-4 clean tennis balls into the dryer as well. This will help to massage the pillows during the drying cycle and ensure the material inside the pillows remains uniformly fluffed. Step 4: Set the dryer on low heat To prevent any damage to the pillows, it's important to use a 'low heat' or 'air fluff' setting. This is because high heat could cause potential damage to the pillow's materials and integrity. Step 5: Run the dryer and monitor Start the dryer and routinely check on the progress of the pillows throughout the drying process. Make sure the pillows are fluffing evenly and there is no sign of damage or uneven heat distribution. Step 6: Remove pillows and test for dryness Once the cycle is complete, remove the pillows from the dryer and check for any dampness.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost.

He can’t do that to himself,” Mr. Eastwood said. “You’re getting as bad as Biden.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Initially, there were no plans for Mr. Eastwood to take a chair onstage. But at the last minute, the actor asked the production staff backstage if he could use one but did not explain why. Had Mr. Eastwood appeared earlier, many fewer people might have noticed. The networks began their hour of convention coverage at 10 p.m. Eastern time, which meant that Mr. Eastwood was the first act of the night for their millions of viewers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He was scheduled to speak for about five minutes but stayed onstage for more than twice as long, throwing off the schedule for Mr. Romney. Mr. Stevens, in an interview, said he would not discuss internal decision making, but he said that Mr. Romney was backstage during Mr. Eastwood’s remarks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “He spoke from the heart with a classic improv sketch which everyone at the convention loved,” Mr. Stevens said, calling it “an honor that a great American icon would come and talk about the failure of the current president.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rush Limbaugh called Mr. Eastwood’s performance “bold.” But other members of the party faithful were not so sure. As they flew home from Tampa on Friday, some delegates grumbled that Mr. Eastwood was a waste of a prime-time slot that might have been better used to feature other speakers or the biographical video of Mr. Romney’s life. Mr. Eastwood is generally liked and respected in Hollywood, where his colleagues often do not agree with his politics. Leonard Hirshan, Mr. Eastwood’s manager, said the actor was traveling and would not be available for interviews. Mr. Hirshan said he had heard a chorus of response since the speech, divided evenly between those supportive and those critical. Mr. Eastwood’s next film, “Trouble With the Curve,” is set for release on Sept. 21.

He believes in what he’s doing.” ||||| Moments before Clint Eastwood approached the lectern at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night, he asked a stagehand to get him a chair. Everyone just assumed he was going to sit in it. Fans that night may have expected to hear from “Dirty Harry”: the cool, controlled enforcer, as deft with a quip as with a gun, effortlessly and eternally hip. Instead, they got something closer to Walt Kowalski, the grizzled old cuss of Eastwood’s 2008 “Gran Torino”: raw, unpolished, a little angry and suddenly much older than you realized. Senior campaign aides said Friday that the unscripted routine by the actor-director — easily the biggest show-biz heavyweight to stand up for a GOP candidate since Frank Sinatra did it for Ronald Reagan — was something of a surprise. The Oscar winner, 82, spoke off the cuff, having discussed a few talking points with campaign advisers and sketched out some rough remarks but preparing nothing for the prompters. Organizers were comfortable with this setup: At the early August fundraiser in Idaho where Eastwood first came out publicly for Mitt Romney, he delivered suave impromptu remarks that had other guests raving. Instead, Eastwood’s wacky conversation with the empty chair (standing in for President Obama — and viewed by about 33 million people, according to Nielsen) became an instant Internet meme. His rambling style triggered snark about his health and his age. His old-timey lawyer jokes brought on a wave of triumphant fact-checking/rebuttal (Romney, like Obama, has a JD). Inside the Tampa convention hall, the crowd roared with delight at Eastwood’s humor. But as Thursday night turned into Friday, Twitter and talking heads piled on the mockery, some claiming Eastwood had managed to upstage and undercut the Republican nominee’s acceptance speech. Ann Romney coolly deemed the actor’s performance “unique” Friday on “CBS This Morning.” “I didn’t know it was coming,” she said with a nervous laugh. Don’t look for Eastwood on the campaign trail this fall. His longtime manager said Friday that the star was traveling back from Florida and unavailable for interview requests or comments — and that hewill not speak to the press at all until he hits the promotional circuit for his next movie, “Trouble With the Curve,” opening Sept. 21. When Eastwood gives his next interviews, manager Leonard Hirshan said,“he’s speaking about the picture, not everything else.” On Friday, the Romney campaign expressed gratitude for the support of a beloved screen icon — no matter how quirky his delivery. “He went out and did what actors do sometimes: He did a little improv,” said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief strategist. Convention producers warily eyed the clock as Eastwood ran over his allotted five minutes by six or seven minutes. And the empty-chair gimmick was a complete surprise. “This was an idea, a moment that moved him, I would say, and he went with it,” Stevens said. He said Romney, standing backstage, laughed appreciatively through Eastwood’s talk. And Stevens praised Eastwood for hitting key talking points: “For him to go out there and to say that there’s a need to change presidents and that he supports Mitt Romney and talk about 23 million people out of work as he did and talk about when someone doesn’t do their job you need to change, that’s a powerful message.” Questioned by a reporter from an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads, Va., Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, said, “I think Clint Eastwood was just being Clint Eastwood.” A rumored Eastwood appearance had been the buzz of the convention from Day 1, after several decades of the Hollywood establishment closing ranks behind Democrats. Entertainers have been especially helpful to the Obama administration, with A-listers such as George Clooney and Sarah Jessica Parker mounting mega-dollar fundraisers for his reelection. “I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking: ‘What’s a movie tradesman doing out here? They’re all left-wingers out there!’ ” Eastwood told the convention hall audience Thursday. But there are indeed “conservative people, moderate people” in Hollywood, he said. They just “play it closer to the vest.” Despite dabbling in politics for years — most notably as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., from 1986 to 1988 — Eastwood’s evolving and hard-to-pin-down views have added to his superstar mystique. An occasional Republican voter who allies with many socially liberal causes, he has long resembled a screenwriter’s fantasy of the perfect square-jawed candidate, which may be why many fans project their beliefs onto him. His evocative but cryptic Chrysler ad that aired during this year’s Super Bowl was interpreted by many pundits as a celebration of the Obama auto-industry bailout — although Eastwood, in fact, opposed it. In an interview with The Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday in November, Eastwood happily talked politics but made no pretense of being a wonk. Many Hollywood types dabbling in advocacy love to show off their mastery of policy, but Eastwood (“I’ve never been a really astute political person”) uttered the simple hopes and gripes of your typical man-on-the-street interview. “They all come up now and they all say the same thing,” he said of politicians, Republican and Democratic alike. “They tell you what they want to get in, and when they get in, they all do something different, so you get the futility aspect of it all.” Although he endorsed Republican John McCain in 2008, Eastwood said he felt good about Obama’s election, at first. “I thought: ‘Well, that’s cool. . . . That’ll be nice for the country and maybe it’ll settle down a lot of racial issues.’ ” Instead, “it kind of went the other way,” he told Hornaday, citing his frustration with how Obama seemed to pick sides in the hot-button dispute when African American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested by a white police officer in Cambridge, Mass. “Just a bad way to jump into it,” Eastwood said. Romney didn’t seem to be on Eastwood’s agenda last fall. (“I liked that fellow from New Jersey, [Gov. Chris] Christie,” he told Hornaday.) It was just over a month ago that he approached the former Massachusetts governor’s campaign to express his support, and he got invited to a pair of Sun Valley, Idaho, events on Aug. 3. “He didn’t act like a Hollywood star,” one guest said. The fundraiser, who was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly, noted that Eastwood had no entourage and made no demands. He posed for pictures with police officers and Secret Service agents and sat at a table eating dinner and conversing with other supporters. “He really wowed both audiences in Sun Valley and could not have been more gracious to the attendees and to Mitt Romney and to the staff,” the fundraiser said. As for the speech Thursday night, the fundraiser said, “I think the nature of Clint Eastwood is he is unpredictable.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The article talks about actor Clint Eastwood giving a speech at the Republican National Convention in support of Mitt Romney.

Question: Question: where is thomas more buried I found the following answer on Google: He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the information provided does not answer the question about where Thomas More is buried. While it is true that he was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century, this does not provide information about his burial location. Thomas More, an English lawyer, philosopher, and statesman, was a key figure during the reign of King Henry VIII. He was a staunch critic of the Protestant Reformation and the king's separation from the Catholic Church, which ultimately led to his execution. More was convicted of treason and beheaded on July 6, 1535 in London. Following his execution, his body was initially buried in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London. The Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula is a Royal Chapel and a place where many people who were executed in the Tower, including some of the most prominent figures of English history like Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard, and Jane Grey, were laid to rest. However, it is widely believed that Thomas More's head, which was displayed on a spike on London Bridge for some time, was eventually retrieved by his daughter Margaret Roper. She is said to have preserved her father's head and later had it interred with her when she passed away. Margaret Roper and her family were buried in St. Dunstan's Church in Canterbury, and it is thought that Thomas More's head might be buried there alongside her. In summary, Thomas More's body is buried in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula in London, and his head is believed to be buried in St. Dunstan's Church in Canterbury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The first country in Oceania, and the fifteenth overall, to legalize same-sex marriage was New Zealand. New Zealand officially legalized same-sex marriage on April 17, 2013, after passing the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 through the New Zealand Parliament, amending the original 1955 Marriage Act. The bill was introduced by Labour Party Member of Parliament Louisa Wall and was passed with a majority of 77 votes in favour and 44 against. The journey towards legalizing same-sex marriage in New Zealand began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with various political parties and advocacy groups pushing for recognition of same-sex couples. The first major breakthrough towards legal recognition came in 2004 with the introduction of the Civil Union Act, which granted same-sex couples many of the same rights and responsibilities as heterosexual married couples. However, this still fell short of full marriage equality, which advocates continued to push for in the following years. The Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 was a significant milestone for LGBTQ+ rights in New Zealand. It redefined marriage as a union between two individuals, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, making it inclusive and equal for all citizens of the country. The granting of marriage licenses for same-sex couples commenced on August 19, 2013, and the first same-sex weddings took place soon after, on August 31, 2013. While the amendment was met with some resistance from conservative political and religious groups, overall, the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand continued the country's long-standing track record of being supportive of progressive social policies. In fact, New Zealand has been at the forefront of many significant milestones in LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality, such as granting same-sex couples adoption rights in 2013 and having one of the first openly transgender Members of Parliament, Georgina Beyer. Since the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand, numerous other countries in Oceania have followed suit, such as Australia in 2017. However, there are still several nations in the region where same-sex relationships remain unrecognized or are actively penalized. In summary, New Zealand was the first country in Oceania, and the fifteenth globally, to legalize same-sex marriage. The passage of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 made marriage an inclusive right for all citizens, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, and set a precedent for future progress in LGBTQ+ rights across Oceania and the rest of the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Pennsylvania's acting secretary of labor and industry has entered a rehabilitation program for at least two weeks after her arrest on a public drunkenness charge last week. Sandi Vito, Pennsylvania's acting labor secretary, has entered a rehab program, the governor's spokesman says. Just a few hours before her arrest, Sandi Vito backed out of a scheduled interview with a CNN correspondent about the state's controversial use of debit cards to pay unemployment benefits. Vito, who was appointed acting secretary of labor and industry in February 2008, \\"has entered a treatment program for two weeks,\\" according to Gov. Ed Rendell's chief spokesman. \\"The governor awaits her return before making any final decisions on her future,\\" the spokesman, Chuck Ardo, told CNN on Monday. CNN had been invited to a public appearance that Vito was making in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, to ask her about the fees banks impose when people choose to receive their unemployment benefits by debit cards instead of checks. Watch how bank fees can surprise people on unemployment ». Those fees range from forty cents to check a balance by telephone, to 1.75 if the debit card is used outside the two free withdrawal periods banks allow. Approximately 925,000 Pennsylvanians were unemployed last month and most used debit cards to receive payments, Pennsylvania officials said. \\"Arrangements have been made for you to interview Department of Labor & Industry Acting Secretary Sandi Vito in Allentown tomorrow at approximately 1 p.m., to discuss our unemployment compensation debit card program,\\" David Smith, a spokesman for the department, e-mailed CNN prior to the scheduled meeting. Yet when a CNN correspondent, accompanied by a camera crew, attempted to interview Vito, she said she did not have the time and ducked out the back door of an elementary school where the public appearance was being staged. An official from her department did give CNN an interview. Later that same night, Vito was arrested on a charge of public drunkenness at the Hilton Hotel in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to Harrisburg Police Chief Charles Keller. News of her arrest did not become public until late Friday. \\"I deeply regret that my actions earlier this week caused embarrassment to the administration and the commonwealth,\\" Vito said in a statement issued to CNN by her office. \\"I take full responsibility for those actions.\\" \\"This incident has had a profound personal effect on me,\\" her statement continued. \\"Today, I am entering an alcohol treatment program because it is the right thing for me to do.\\" According to public records, Vito earns a salary of 136,120 annually.

( revolutions per minutes ) of the wheel is","completion":"The task is asking you to find the number of revolutions the wheel of a bus makes in one minute, given the radius of the wheel and the speed at which the bus is traveling. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Note the given information: - The radius of the wheel is 70 cm. - The speed of the bus is 66 km/h. 2. Convert the radius to meters and the speed to meters per minute: - Radius: 70 cm = 0.7 meters (divide by 100, as there are 100 cm in 1 meter) - Speed: 66 km/h = 66,000 meters/h (multiply by 1,000, as there are 1,000 meters in 1 km). To convert 66,000 meters per hour to meters per minute, divide by 60 (as there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the speed in meters per minute is 66,000 / 60 = 1,100 meters/minute. 3. Calculate the circumference of the wheel, using the formula: Circumference = 2 * pi * radius - Circumference = 2 * pi * 0.7 ≈ 4.4 meters (pi is approximately equal to 3.14) 4. Find the number of wheel revolutions needed to cover a given distance: - Since the wheel covers the distance equal to its circumference in one revolution, to cover the bus speed of 1,100 meters per minute, we need to find out how many times the wheel's circumference (4.4 meters) fits into the total distance covered in one minute (1,100 meters). - To do this, divide the distance covered in a minute (1,100 meters) by the circumference of the wheel (4.4 meters). 5.

Here is a question about this article: As a result of the Libyan Civil War, the United Nations enacted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone over Libya, and the protection of civilians from the forces of Muammar Gaddafi. The United States, along with Britain, France and several other nations, committed a coalition force against Gaddafi's forces. On 19 March, the first U.S. action was taken when 114 Tomahawk missiles launched by US and UK warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the Gaddafi regime. The U.S. continued to play a major role in Operation Unified Protector, the NATO-directed mission that eventually incorporated all of the military coalition's actions in the theater. Throughout the conflict however, the U.S. maintained it was playing a supporting role only and was following the UN mandate to protect civilians, while the real conflict was between Gaddafi's loyalists and Libyan rebels fighting to depose him.

While both options may be true, choosing option II, \\"Megan is a friend to others,\\" is a more fitting continuation of the sentence provided. This selection emphasizes the camaraderie and supportive nature of Megan, which gives context to why Natalie is stopping by to congratulate her. It suggests that Megan's interpersonal relationships and her friendships are essential components of her character and are highly valued by her friends, like Natalie. Moreover, it highlights the mutual appreciation and affection within their social circle, creating a rich tapestry of connections among the individuals involved. Option I, on the other hand, focuses on Natalie's ability to be a friend, which is not directly related to the subject matter of the original sentence. While it is a nice sentiment and could be a valid addition to the story, to maintain the flow of the narrative and keep the focus on Megan's importance, it is better to choose option II. In summary, Megan's friendly nature towards others plays a vital role in her social circle – an attribute that is appreciated and celebrated by her close friends like Natalie.

According to videos and tweets from the night, West told fans —in no particular order — that if he'd voted he would have voted for Donald Trump; that Trump’s approach to campaigning was \\"absolutely genius because it fucking worked\\"; that black people need to stop \\"being distracted\\" by racism and accept that the US is a racist country; and that he himself is still planning to run for president in 2020. West seems to have peppered these comments and more throughout the entire night, with concertgoers reporting that he repeatedly stopped songs, sometimes to go on longer rants, and sometimes just to make a single comment. Twitter user @RaptorJesuss live-tweeted the entire show, but here are some of the highlights: Kanye just said he thinks he'll have the experience in 2020 to run for office, I'm dead serious, Kanye just said he's preparing for 2020. — Raptor (@RaptorJesuss) November 18, 2016 Kanye West just stopped the show again to tell us that Kanye liked Trumps campaign.

Answer the following question: Information: - De Oratore (\\"On the Orator\\"; not to be confused with \\"Orator\\") is a dialogue written by Cicero in 55 BCE. It is set in 91 BCE, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius Orator, the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common. This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome. - Lucius Licinius Crassus ( 140 BC -- 91 BC ) was a Roman consul . He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day , by his pupil Cicero . He became consul in 95 BC. During his consulship a law was passed ( the lex Licinia Mucia ) requiring all but citizens to leave Rome , an edict which provoked the Social War . In 92 BC he was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus . Licinius Crassus was married to Mucia Tertia , younger daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur by his wife Laelia , daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens . They had two surviving children : Licinia Crassa Prima or Major married to the Praetor of 93 BC , Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica , the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and descendant of Scipio Africanus and Scipio Nasica , and by whom she had issue Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor , who married Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius , eventually Pontifex Maximus who adopted Licinia Crassa Major 's son , who then became known as Metellus Scipio . According to both Plutarch and Cicero , a Licinia , daughter of this man , was married to Gaius Marius the Younger . The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC , though the date is pure supposition by scholars , based on the known political alliance between the two fathers ( Crassus and Gaius Marius ) , the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14 , but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances . Nothing is known of Licinia after Marius the Younger 's death in 82 BC , although in the time of Caesar Amatius , a Pseudo-Marius , appeared in Rome claiming to be their son - Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius , though he tried not to involve himself in a politically difficult situation . He is also noted by Cicero in De Oratore that Licinius Crassus was a friend of Marcus Vigellius . - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. - Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (c. 138 BC 78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's \\"Parallel Lives\\" Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander.

Andy is playing with a rubber band. He stretches the rubber band out as far as he can without breaking it Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:","completion":"Based on the paragraph, compressing a spring will cause it to return to its original shape.

If there’s one thing that’s consistent about Netflix’s “House of Cards,” it’s that there are always several moments each season that stick with you for awhile — and not necessarily in a good way. Whether it’s Zoe Barnes getting pushed in front of a Metro train or Frank and Claire Underwood inviting a Secret Service agent into the bedroom for some unexpected extracurricular activities, there’s no shortage of strange images in the first two seasons. That grand tradition continues into Season 3, which premiered Friday. [Related: What happened on “House of Cards” Season 2? Here’s a reminder.] I’m four episodes in (your viewing speed may vary), and there’s already a lot going on. Frank officially swindled his way into becoming president, but it’s not going very well: He can’t get any bills passed and his own party would prefer he not run in the 2016 election. Claire manipulates everything to become United Nations ambassador. Doug Stamper, formerly Frank’s right-hand man, survived being attacked by Rachel (the prostitute he tried to kidnap last season) but is recovering incredibly slowly. Hacker Gavin hates working as the FBI, even if it’s a trade-off for not going to jail — but he’s trying to help Doug track down Rachel, because she still knows too much. Oh, and we learn that Secretary of State Catherine Durant has killer beer pong skills.

Intestines: CO2 is not primarily transported to the intestines by hemoglobin.

Roland and Wat would rather take their share of coins and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in Rouen, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge the patent of nobility that will allow William to enter under the assumed name of \\"Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein\\" from Gelderland. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armour is damaged. He goads Kate, a female blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the sword event at the tournament. In the joust, he faces a Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust of the tournament, Adhemar defeats William. Kate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour allowing him greater mobility. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Edward, the Black Prince. Adhemar withdraws, but William continues the match and then addresses the prince by name, further earning Edward's respect. Adhemar... My question: What century does A Knight's tale take place in?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Invincible Context: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people...

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured the Rank Group Plc and in the years that followed asset stripping and streamlining of the business has left it a shadow of its former self, with all their remaining operating interests now in gambling. - Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde (28 March 1921 8 May 1999), was an English actor and writer. Initially a matinée idol in films such as \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art-house films. In a second career, he wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in \\"The Daily Telegraph\\". - The Daily Telegraph, commonly referred to simply as The Telegraph, is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as \\"The Daily Telegraph and Courier\\". - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914 5 August 2000) was an English actor. After an early career on the stage, he was featured in several of the Ealing Comedies, including \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" in which he played eight different characters. He is also known for his six collaborations with David Lean: Herbert Pocket in \\"Great Expectations\\" (1946), Fagin in \\"Oliver Twist\\" (1948), Col. Nicholson in \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" (1957, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Prince Faisal in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" (1962), General Yevgraf Zhivago in \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" (1965), and Professor Godbole in \\"A Passage to India\\" (1984). He is also known for his portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. - Doctor in Distress is a 1963 British comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas and starring Dirk Bogarde , James Robertson Justice , and Samantha Eggar . It 's the fifth of the seven films in the Doctor series . After a one - film absence , it marked the final return to the role of Simon Sparrow by Dirk Bogarde , and also the return ( although in a different role ) of Donald Houston . The film uses some of the characters in Richard Gordon 's Doctor novels , but is n't based on any of the novels . - Donald Daniel Houston (6 November 1923 13 October 1991) was a Welsh actor whose first two films \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" (1949) with Jean Simmons, and \\"A Run for Your Money\\" (1949) with Sir Alec Guinness were highly successful. Later in his career he was cast in military roles and in comedies such as the \\"Doctor\\" and \\"Carry On\\" series. 'doctor in distress ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'production company'? Choices: - prince - rank organisation - screen - united kingdom The answer to this question is:","completion":"- Rank Organisation In the shared information, it was mentioned that the Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate that produced numerous films. Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde, who starred in the \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) was identified as one of the actors working for the Rank Organisation. Additionally, the film \\"Doctor in Distress,\\" which was released in 1963 and starred Dirk Bogarde, is another one from the same \\"Doctor\\" series. This leads us to make an informed guess that \\"Doctor in Distress\\" was produced by the Rank Organisation. Therefore, the movie 'doctor in distress ' is related to the entity 'Rank Organisation' through the relation of 'production company'. Established in 1937 by J. Arthur Rank, the Rank Organisation quickly became one of the most significant and integrated film companies in Britain, being involved in film production, distribution, and exhibition. Besides the movie industry, it even branched into the production of radios, TVs, and photocopiers being part of Rank Xerox. However, over the years, the original Rank Organisation underwent several structural changes and reductions in its operations, and by 1996 its name and remaining assets were absorbed into the Rank Group Plc which now predominantly focuses on gambling. On a side note, Dirk Bogarde, after portraying leading roles in commercial films like the \\"Doctor\\" series for the Rank Organisation, later delved into art-house films. He then pursued writing, creating seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels, and a volume of collected journalism, primarily for The Daily Telegraph, a major national British daily broadsheet newspaper. One should also be mindful that the film industry is a complicated mixture of artistry and commerce. Films, also known as movies or motion pictures, are created by capturing a series of still images and displaying them rapidly on a screen, which gives the illusion of motion to the viewer due to a phenomenon known as the 'phi' phenomenon. The process of making a film can involve several techniques, ranging from photographing actual scenes or using miniatures in traditional animation to using advanced computer graphics and animation. A bit about another character Donald Houston, a Welsh actor recognized for his roles in comedies such as the \\"Doctor\\" and \\"Carry On\\" series and military-related films. The reference to Sir Alec Guinness, another acclaimed English actor, relates more broadly to the context of classic British cinema. Guinness is perhaps most remembered for his roles in several Ealing Comedies, his collaborations with David Lean, and of course, his iconic role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy. In summary, comedy as a film genre has played a pivotal role in the industry, with organizations like the Rank Organisation leading in the production of such films, and actors like Dirk Bogarde, Donald Houston, and Alec Guinness being key performers in these comedic roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why might the Butterfly Garden be closed ?","completion":"There could be several reasons why the Butterfly Garden at the Pacific Science Garden was closed for the week. Some of these reasons might include: 1. Maintenance and Upkeep: It is possible that the Butterfly Garden was closed for routine maintenance or needed repairs. Gardens require regular care, such as trimming plants, repairing pathways, managing insect populations, and maintaining the butterfly habitat. Closing the garden for a week could provide the staff with the opportunity to complete tasks without disturbing visitors and ensuring the safety and well-being of the butterflies. 2. Seasonal Changes: Depending on the time of the year, the Butterfly Garden might be closed due to seasonal changes. Butterflies thrive in specific temperature ranges and humidity levels. The Butterfly Garden might be closed temporarily if the local climate or natural butterfly life cycle requires adjustments to the environment to ensure optimal living conditions for the butterflies. 3. Staff Training or Vacation: The Butterfly Garden may be closed if the staff is attending training sessions, team-building activities, or taking a scheduled vacation. As an integral part of running a successful garden, it is essential to have trained and motivated staff members. 4. Private Events: Occasionally, gardens and other public spaces may close for private events, such as weddings, corporate functions, or educational programs. These events might require exclusive access to the Butterfly Garden, resulting in temporary closure for the general public. 5. Pests or Diseases: The Butterfly Garden could also be closed due to unexpected issues, such as a pest breakout or the presence of diseases that could affect the health of the butterflies and plants. In such cases, closing the garden would be necessary to prevent further damage and allow staff to treat and control the problem. 6. Renovations or Expansions: The garden may have been closed for the week to undergo renovations or expansions. It could be that the garden is adding new features, plants, or butterfly species to enhance the visitor's experience in the future. While these are some of the possible reasons for the temporary closure of the Butterfly Garden, it is always best to check the operating hours and any announcements on their website or social media platforms for specific reasons or updates before visiting the garden to avoid any disappointment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

Article:Among the glamorous chandeliers and big mirrors dozens of women are browsing rails of patterned skirts, trying on brightly coloured coats and buying items from the designer collection. Women's fashion chain Bonmarche's flagship store in Uxbridge has had a complete makeover. The aim: to make it as easy as possible for the more mature lady to shop. From easier-to-read price tags and bigger changing rooms to comfy seats for husbands to rest on, this store now feels like Top Shop for the over-50s. Trading conditions may be tough on the High Street, but this fashion chain is making quite a comeback. In fact, it is hard to think of another retail business that's turned itself around, from administration, as quickly or as successfully as Bonmarche. The company, and its owner, the fashion chain Peacocks, went under in January 2012 in one of the biggest retail collapses since Woolworths. It buckled under massive debts. When Bonmarche fell into administration, it had nearly 400 shops. Private investors snapped it up for around Â£10m. It now has 265 stores across the UK, and is worth more than Â£100m, having recently floated 40% of its shares on the stock market. Beth Butterwick was put in charge of the turnaround as chief executive. In her first interview, she told me she had no doubts about the chain's potential. \\"I could see the opportunity to really cater for this growing demographic. I could absolutely see that Bonmarche was a gem amongst the High Street, it just needed to be loved,\\" Mrs Butterwick says. Women's fashion is hugely competitive, with many chains chasing the younger shopper. Mrs Butterwick decided that the key to Bonmarche's success was to focus solely on older women. \\"The business before had drifted into catering products for a much younger customer and putting prices up. In other words they had moved away from the core values of our business. \\"So the low-hanging fruit was to reposition the clothing back to the core customer,\\" reflects Mrs Butterwick. The strategy appears to be working. Since this store in Uxbridge re-opened, sales are up a whopping 40%. \\"We have an amazingly loyal customer base, some 6.5 million customers. And we've made it our mission to cater for the way they want to shop. \\"We have three different sets of customers spanning three different generations, the late-40s up to the late-80s,\\" says Mrs Butterwick. Another ingredient in Bonmarche's success has been celebrity designer David Emanuel, the man who designed Princess Diana's wedding dress (and recent contestant on ITV show I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!). His collections for the chain have proved hugely popular. He told me the larger, more mature lady has been neglected by the fashion industry. \\"Just because women get to a certain age doesn't mean women lose sight of fashion. They want to look fashionable and want to be flattered. Women are now virtually ageless, if they dress well,\\" he says. \\"My challenge as a designer is to provide stylish clothing at affordable prices, season after season. Once the lady grows older, we have to look after her and our customers keep coming back.\\" Did he worry that Bonmarche might not survive? \\"The dark days, I'm delighted to say, have gone. I'm very excited.\\" He also believes having a woman at the helm is key. \\"Now there's a woman in charge who believes in the label, believes in David Emanuel, believes in Bonmarche, believes in her customers and she's done an enormous amount of work,\\" he says. \\"It's a completely different business... it's like chalk and cheese. And that's all down to her. Of course, she's got professional teams around her, she's handpicked key people who love the business with a passion. \\"She thinks fashion, she feels fashion, she deals with fashion and we're on the same wavelength.\\" The turnaround plan involved closing dozens of unprofitable stores. The new management team negotiated new rent deals on many existing stores. Unlike most national chains, they're now looking to expand once more, opening new High Street stores. They've opened several shops in garden centres, and they're looking at selling clothes on cruise ships and in care homes. The aim is to go where the customers are. And it is certainly where the growth is in retail. \\"The prospects for serving the older consumer in retail are enormous, because if you look over to the next 10 years the vast majority of the growth, well over two-thirds, comes from the plus-55 consumer,\\" according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino. \\"So any retailer who serves that segment of the market hasn't got success guaranteed but it has got a much greater chance of seeing sales traction than someone serving other demographic groups.\\" Bonmarche doesn't have much in the way of competition on the High Street for now. The question is, for how long? In his studio, Mr Emanuel has finished the Bonmarche spring collection, sprinkled with prints and pinks, and he's already starting to think about next winter's ranges. He knows what the future challenge will be. \\"Everybody now realises what we're doing, and people are trying to emulate us, which is always very flattering,\\" he says. \\"We're getting it right, and investors are excited but we need to stay one step ahead.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"In this article, there is a store called Bonmarche, which sells clothes for women who are a bit older.

Morgan from the following article ? James Longacre died suddenly at his home in Philadelphia on January 1, 1869. A memorial meeting was held at the Philadelphia Mint on January 5, attended by the facility's employees. The Director of the Mint, Henry Linderman, delivered a speech in praise of Longacre prior to the formal eulogy, which was given by Longacre's assistant, William Barber, who would be appointed as Longacre's successor. Like each of his predecessors, Longacre died in office.Longacre was recognized in an exhibit of 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the New York Public Library in 1928. In 1970, art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, \\"uniform in their dullness, lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [Thomas] Sully, [Titian] Peale, [Robert] Hughes, and Gobrecht\\" and \\"whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he seems not to have brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint.\\" However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art, far above the mundane.In his 1991 article, McKenzie notes Vermeule's concerns, but considers Longacre's work important for its use of American symbols, including the representations of Native Americans. He believes Longacre's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers, such as George T. Morgan, Victor D. Brenner, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. He particularly praises the ornate scroll on the reverse of the double eagle, calling it \\"unique in American numismatic art and enhances the elegance of a design befitting the highest-denomination U.S. coin\\", and applauds \\"the exciting innovation in symbolism and expression of national sentiment that he brought to U.S. numismatic art\\".According to Bowers, \\"Today, Longacre is widely admired by numismatists.\\" Lange notes that Longacre's \\"artistic vision graced 60 years of American coins\\".

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The differences between the use of \\"in\\" and \\"on\\", as well as the usage of \\"will\\" and \\"would\\" are distinct and based on specific grammatical rules. 1. Difference between \\"in\\" and \\"on\\": \\"In\\" and \\"on\\" are prepositions that express different relationships between words within a sentence. The choice between them is typically related to their function in describing location, time, or certain situations. a) Location: \\"In\\": It is generally used to express that something is enclosed or contained within something else, or to describe an area or space. Examples: - The book is in the bag. - I live in New York. - The key is in the drawer. \\"On\\": It usually indicates that something is above or touching a surface or object, describing a position or point on a surface. Examples: - The painting is on the wall. - She left her glasses on the table. - They are standing on the bridge. b) Time: \\"In\\": It is used to refer to a broader period of time, such as months, years, seasons, or parts of the day. Examples: - I will see you in September. - They got married in 2010. - I like to read in the evening. \\"On\\": This preposition is used more specifically to indicate days or dates. Examples: - The meeting is scheduled on Tuesday. - My birthday is on the 15th of June. 2. Difference between \\"will\\" and \\"would\\": \\"Will\\" and \\"would\\" are auxiliary verbs that primarily express future actions, intentions, or possibilities. They are used to talk about future events, make conditional statements, requests, and offer promises. a) \\"Will\\": This auxiliary verb is used to indicate future actions, declarations, or intentions. It is also the standard auxiliary for forming the future tense in English. Examples: - I will call you tomorrow. - They will arrive at 9 am. - She will start the new job on Monday. b) \\"Would\\": It acts as the past form of \\"will\\" and is often used to suggest hypothetical, unlikely, imaginary, or conditional situations, as well as being used to express politeness in requests. Examples: - I would go to the party if I weren't sick. (conditional) - She would have finished her homework if her computer hadn't broken down. (hypothetical) - Would you please close the window? (polite request) - When we were young, we would play soccer every weekend. (past habit) Now, to address your last question: \\"Do those questions have the same meaning?\\" No, the questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to the difference between the prepositions \\"in\\" and \\"on\\", while the second question refers to the distinction between the auxiliary verbs \\"will\\" and \\"would\\". While both questions inquire about the differences between two common English terms, they each relate to distinct aspects of grammar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose your answer from: 1). ashamed of my parents; 2). bored and sleepy; 3). proud of himself; Answer:","completion":"Based on the information you provided, it seems that Robin is expressing a genuine interest in potentially marrying you in the future. This indicates that he sees a long-term relationship with you as something to aspire to and values the connection you both share. With this context, let's examine each of the possible reactions and determine the most likely one: 1). Ashamed of my parents: There is no information given to suggest that Robin feels ashamed of your parents. Robin shared his desire to marry you with them, which implies that he respects them and was comfortable enough to discuss this significant matter with them. It's unlikely that Robin would feel ashamed of your parents after this gesture. 2). Bored and sleepy: Robin's intention to marry you someday suggests that he is excited about the future possibilities of the relationship. This feeling is not typically associated with boredom or sleepiness. It's unlikely that Robin would feel bored and sleepy after expressing such a meaningful sentiment to your parents. 3). Proud of himself: Out of the three given options, feeling proud of himself seems like the most fitting reaction for Robin after expressing his intention to marry you someday. By sharing this with your parents, he is demonstrating courage and commitment, both of which can evoke a feeling of pride. Additionally, he might feel happy and encouraged if your parents provided a supportive response. This could further increase his sense of pride and satisfaction with his decision to share his intentions with them. So, in conclusion, it's most reasonable to assume that Robin would feel proud of himself for expressing his interest in marrying you someday to your parents. This pride may originate from his bravery in discussing such a significant matter with them and also because he values the relationship you share and its potential future."},{"prompt":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the original name of the place that was named Hotel Frances in 1925?, using the article: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

Given equation is: 69*z = 523*z + 9080 Step 1: The first step is to isolate the variable z on one side of the equation.

Do this by dividing every term by -454. So, (-454z) / -454 = 9080 / -454 Which simplifies into: z = -20 So, the solution for the equation 69*z = 523*z + 9080 is z = -20.

This phrase is pronounced \\"ruv toe-DOT.\\" Remember to use the soft, \\"French\\" r sound at the back of the throat, rather than a hard English r. While Hebrew doesn't have strict tenses and word forms for formal situations, but if you want to say thank you in a very polite, formal way, you can use gender-specific grammar. This specific phrase is used when the speaker is a man. It doesn't matter what gender the person being thanked is. This phrase is pronounced. \\"ah-NEE moe-DEH leh-HHAH.\\" The most difficult sound here is the \\"hah\\" at the end. It's not quite like the English \\"ha\\" used for laughter.

She tells him some guy stole the moped she was on while she was in the store and that it happened so fast she couldn't catch up to him. Manni begins to cry. He tells Lola that he made a big mistake and claims they're going to kill him. Lola asks him what happened and he begins to recollect the events. He says everything was going as planned; the car transactions went well, he got the diamonds he needed and crossed the border successfully, his encounter with a dealer went well, and he got the money he needed: 100,000 marks. All that was missing was her waiting for him at the spot. He walked to the train station and got on, but a bum bumped into him and fell. He helped the bum up, but two security guards got on the train. On instinct, he got off leaving the bag of money on the seat. He did not realize it until a minute or two later. He tried to go back to get the money but was stopped by the two security guards. The train left with the bag of money and the bum opened it, immediately grabbing it for himself. Manni tells Lola he would not be in this situation if she had been there on time. He blames her for being so sensitive and for believing love can solve anything. He tells her to come up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes because that is all the time he has left before he has to meet Ronnie, his boss, and turn in the money or else he will kill him. He begins to tell her that over and over again until Lola screams \\"Stop\\" so loud, a few glasses on her TV set break. She finally tells him that she will come up with something in twenty minutes. She tells him to stay where he is and she will get him the money. He gets desperate and spots a store across...","completion":"The movie \\"Run Lola Run\\" was directed by Tom Tykwer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - accomplish - notoriety - hellfire - learn about - religion","completion":"The option that is most in line with common sense to answer the question, \\"What are mission workers constantly telling many people about?\\" is religion. Mission workers, often associated with religious organizations, are dedicated to spreading their faith and religious teachings to others. Their primary goal is to educate, support, and provide spiritual guidance to the communities they serve. Religion plays a vital role in the lives of many individuals, and mission workers aim to share their beliefs with others in the hope of providing a deeper understanding of their faith. Mission workers may belong to various religious denominations, such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism, but the core objective remains the same: to spread the teachings and principles of their respective faiths. Mission workers engage in various activities, such as: 1. Evangelism: They engage in spreading the message of their religion and converting others to their faith. 2. Education: Mission workers often participate in teaching the religious tenets, scriptures, and principles to both new and existing followers. 3. Community Service: They contribute to the well-being of communities by offering support and assistance in areas such as healthcare, education, and housing. 4. Disaster Relief: In times of crisis, mission workers provide aid and support to those affected by natural disasters or conflict situations. 5. Cultural Exchange: They encourage and facilitate interfaith dialogue, promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect among different religious groups. It is important to note that while some of the other options listed, such as \\"learn about\\" or \\"accomplish,\\" might be related to the work mission workers do, these terms do not encompass the broader scope of their activities and objectives. Religion, as an option, encapsulates the heart of mission work and addresses the primary purpose of these devoted individuals: to share their faith and make a positive impact on the lives of those they encounter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer? from the following article ? As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music....

Article: One day,Mr.Arnold was teaching a lesson,and things were going as normally as ever.He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils.He told them that,in the beginning,men were nomads ;they never stayed in the same place for very long.Instead,they would travel about,here and there,in search of food,wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up: \\"And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?\\" Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl.He knew that she lived with her parents in a house,so she must know that her family were not nomads;so what did she mean? \\"We have all become nomads again,\\" continued Lucy.\\"The other day,outside the city,they were cutting the forest down.

A charity worker has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work. George Maccoy also claimed to have completed 25 years in the RAF, but documentation suggested he had only completed 16 days before buying himself out without completing his basic training. He was employed as a ‘meeter and greeter’ at Corporation of Trinity House, a 500-year-old charity based in Newcastle which helps to care for mariners and their dependents. Disgraceful: George Maccoy, 60, has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work. While he was employed, he claimed he had testicular cancer and forged letters from an imaginary consultant to justify taking time off work for fictitious hospital appointments. The charity had sacked the 60-year-old for nine counts of gross misconduct which included running-up up a 'considerable bill' by calling a dating agency on the handyman’s phone, the tribunal was told. But Mr Maccoy claimed he had been unfairly dismissed when the breakdown of a relationship triggered an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder which his managers failed to deal with. But his case was withdrawn and the tribunal was shown paperwork stating the 60-year-old served just 16 days in the RAF in 1979 without having completed his basic training. And in a rare move by the tribunal panel, Mr Maccoy was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs after a second claim for disability discrimination was withdrawn in June this year. Mr Maccoy was employed by Master, Pilots and Seamen of the Corporation of Trinity House, where he worked as a 'meeter and greeter' attending to VIPs and guests at the charity’s functions. Fantasist: George Maccoy was employed as a 'meeter and greeter' at a 500-year-old charity. But the organisation, which helps support poor mariners as well as examining and licensing deep sea shipping pilots, dismissed him in May last year after it was discovered that he had lied about suffering from cancer. Mr Maccoy had used a work printer to write letters from medical experts in which he lied about suffering from testicular cancer, the tribunal was told. He lost his £8-an-hour job after colleagues discovered the forged letter from fictitious consultant oncologist Simon Carter, a character created by Mr Maccoy to justify taking time off work to attend appointments, it was said. In February Mr Maccoy - who has spoken publicly about his battle to deal with the demons of war - launched a damages claim for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. But a legal team from Eversheds, led by senior associate Stephen Cairns, refuted the claims and in April they produced a letter from the RAF which said Mr Maccoy enlisted on March 21, 1972, but bought himself out just 16 days later on April 6. It is unclear if Mr Maccoy subsequently served in other parts of the armed forces or whether he saw action on foreign soil. It is believed that he was a member of the Territorial Army at some point. But Mr Cairns produced evidence at the tribunal which suggested Mr Maccoy had been working in South Tyneside as a caretaker during the 1990s when he claimed to be a serving aircraftsman. A spokeswoman for Trinity House said: 'The Newcastle Trinity House is pleased with the outcome of this employment tribunal which makes clear that all Mr Maccoy’s claims were completely untrue. 'We are, however, both deeply shocked and saddened that Mr Maccoy invented a past history with the RAF and moreover that he chose to fabricate post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of combat experience. 'We feel such deception is not only disturbing but also demeaning to all those genuine victims from our armed forces.' Mr Maccoy refused to comment following the tribunal but in a claim submitted to the tribunal, Mr Maccoy said: 'I was dismissed from my employment for alleged gross misconduct. 'At that time and presently I was/am suffering severe depression, also severe PTSD causing me to suffer loss of intellectual and social functions, whilst striving to hold down full-time employment.'

He told his workplace that he had cancer so he could take time off of work but it was not true. 3. He used a printer at work to make fake letters from a doctor that he made up. 4. George also said that he had worked in the RAF, a big group that helps the UK stay safe, for 25 years, but that was not true either. He only worked there for 16 days a long time ago in 1979. 5. The place where George was working was helping people who work on boats and their families. They had to let him go. 6. He was caught doing other bad things too, like using a phone at work to use a dating service and charge it to the company. 7. He tried to say that he was treated unfairly, made up more stories about his health and tried to get money, but the people at the court knew that he was making it up. 8. In the end, the court told George that he has to pay £10,000 because of the trouble he caused. 9. The people at the place where George worked are very sad that he made up so many stories.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve 116*r - 9918 = -376*r - 59*r for r. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve for r, we need to follow these steps: 1. Combine the \\"r\\" terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Move all \\"r\\" terms to one side and the numbers to the other side. 3. Divide to find the value of \\"r\\". Let's do each step slowly: 1. We have three \\"r\\" terms: 116*r, -376*r, and -59*r. We combine -376*r and -59*r first: -376 - 59 = -435. Now, we have 116*r on one side and -435*r on the other side. 2. Move all \\"r\\" terms to one side: To do this, you can add 435*r to both sides of the equation. 116*r + 435*r - 9918 = -435*r + 435*r (-9918 remains on the left side) Now, we need to add 116*r and 435*r: 116 + 435 = 551. So, we get: 551*r - 9918 = 0 3. Move -9918 to the other side by adding 9918 to both sides: 551*r = 9918 Now, let's divide by 551 to find the value of \\"r\\": r = 9918 ÷ 551 When we do the division, we find that r = 18.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: While Dave Peverett is best known as the original lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of Foghat, what is Eicca Toppinen best known for? A:","completion":"Eicca Toppinen is primarily recognized and renowned for being the lead cellist, composer, and founding member of the Finnish symphonic metal band Apocalyptica. Born in Helsinki, Finland, on August 5, 1965, Toppinen started playing the cello at a very young age and demonstrated outstanding talent in music composition and performance. Unlike Dave Peverett, Toppinen followed a different musical path focused more on the interplay of classical and heavy metal music. Having chosen the cello as his signature music instrument, he essentially created a unique blend of music that sought an equilibrium point between two seemingly disparate music genres. Apocalyptica was formed during his time at the Sibelius Academy of Music in Helsinki in 1993 where he and three other cellists – Paavo Lötjönen, Max Lilja, and Perttu Kivilaakso – decided to perform Metallica songs on their cellos for fun. Their debut performance was in 1995 where Eicca played Metallica covers. This eventually led to the band's first album, \\"Plays Metallica by Four Cellos\\" in 1996. The album was highly successful and marked a new form of instrumental music that was warmly received by fans globally. This success played a significant role in shaping Toppinen's future career as a music artist in the symphonic metal genre. Eicca Toppinen stands out not only as an extraordinary cellist but also as a versatile music composer. He has contributed extensively to the music industry resulting in several album releases, numerous live performances, successful tours, and many collaborations with prominent figures within both the classical and contemporary music industry. His elaborate combination of traditional symphony elements and rock beats gives Apocalyptica a unique sound that distinguishes them from other bands. The cello, under Toppinen's skillful manipulation, gains a particular aesthetic that transcends the traditional bounds of classical string music. This approach allows the cello to seamlessly infuse with heavy metal rhythms, pushing beyond its usual orchestral role and into an instrument capable of more dramatic and dynamic expressivity. Therefore, Eicca Toppinen, through his mastery and innovative approach to music, finds a way to blend and harmonize such different music styles, challenging the traditional norms and structures of music genres. In conclusion, Eicca Toppinen is best known as an innovative cellist and composer for the Finnish symphonic metal band Apocalyptica. His major contribution is largely tied to his unique craft of blending classical cello music and heavy metal to create a distinct brand of symphonic metal that has contributed immensely to the diversification of contemporary music worldwide. While his journey differs from that of Dave Peverett, they both have distinct elements that define their musicianship and contribute uniquely to the world of music."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Senators Returning With Little Urgency as Fiscal Clock Ticks WASHINGTON — President Obama and members of the Senate are set to return to Washington on Thursday to make a last-ditch effort at a deal to avert more than a half-trillion dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts just five days before they start kicking in. Even with so much at stake, there appeared to be little sense of urgency. Senate aides say most senators are not likely to be back on Capitol Hill before Thursday evening. And while the House may technically be in session, Republican leaders told members last week they would be given a 48-hour notice before they should return, and that notice has not yet been given. Senate Democratic and Republican leaders have also not talked in days, according to aides on both sides. But lawmakers continue to say a deal is possible to avert the “fiscal cliff,” when taxes leap to Clinton-era rates on Jan. 1 and 100 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs kick in the next day. “Nobody wants to go over this fiscal cliff. It will damage our economy. It will hurt every taxpayer. It will be the largest tax increase in history, affect everybody,” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, warned on CNN on Wednesday. “And anyone who’s watching who thinks, oh, this isn’t going to impact me, you will find out that it will.” Congressional aides involved in the negotiations say the prospects for a deal dimmed considerably after the debacle in the House last Thursday, when Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio could not muster the votes for legislation to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts for income below 1 million a year. With his “Plan B” in tatters, Mr. Boehner met privately with House Republicans last Thursday night, delivered the Serenity Prayer, and declared it up to the Senate now to find a way forward. But publicly, leaders in the Senate are just as far apart. Senate Republican leaders say President Obama should press Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to take up legislation passed by the House that would extend all of the Bush tax cuts for a year, and another House bill that would cancel 50 billion in military cuts and shift those cuts onto domestic programs. Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid have repeatedly said that will never happen. Since the president signed legislation in late 2010 extending all the Bush-era tax cuts for two years, he has never strayed from his vow to veto any legislation that extends them again for affluent households. The president and the Senate majority leader want the Senate to take up legislation it has already passed to extend the tax cuts on income below 250,000, and attach an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a provision to temporarily suspend the budget cuts while talks on a larger deficit reduction deal continue next year. But Democrats say they will move forward only if Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, can assure that either the bill can pass with a simple majority or that he will not press Republicans to vote against it on a 60-vote threshold. The leader’s spokesman, Don Stewart, said he could offer no such assurances. Besides, Mr. Stewart said from the Capitol, there has been “no outreach from Democrats, here or from the White House” to formally make such a request. Still, Democrats do appear to be readying for one last push. Steps were being taken in Hawaii to name a new senator as early as Wednesday to fill the seat of Daniel Inouye, whose funeral was on Sunday. A quick decision by Gov. Neal Abercrombie, a Democrat, to fill the seat could provide Democrats with a needed vote. Before his death, Mr. Inouye wrote the governor and recommended that Representative Colleen Hanabusa be named his successor. Tulsi Gabbard, who was elected to the House in November, is openly campaigning for the Senate post even before she is sworn in to the lower chamber. Despite the imminent return of the Senate, many lawmakers now say no deal will be made until after the deadline. On Jan. 3, Mr. Boehner is likely to be re-elected speaker for the 113th Congress. After that roll call, he may feel less pressure from his right flank against a deal. For its part, the Senate may simply be out of time. Without unanimous agreement, Mr. Reid would have to call up a deal and file for a vote just to take it up. He could then be forced to press for another vote to cut off debate before final passage. If forced to jump through all those hoops, the 112th Senate could expire before the final votes could be cast. “I think there’s some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January, which technically means you’re going over the cliff,” Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNBC on Wednesday morning. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about how the President and the Senate are trying to make a deal to stop big changes in taxes and money spent by the government. These changes could hurt the economy and affect many people. They only have a few days to make this deal, but everyone does not seem to be in a hurry. They are trying to find a way to agree on how to handle taxes and the spending on different programs.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a coffee filter is made of thicker paper happens, how will it affect less coffee makes it through the filter. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a coffee filter made of thicker paper does indeed have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Here's a step-by-step justification of the impact: 1. Direct effect: Using a thicker paper filter will potentially slow down the flow of water through the coffee grounds. This is because the increased thickness of the paper creates more resistance for the water to pass through. 2. Flavor extraction: As a result of the slower water flow, there might be a change in how efficiently flavors are extracted from the coffee grounds. On one hand, longer contact time between water and grounds could result in over-extraction, which might lead to a bitter tasting coffee. On the other hand, if the flow is too slow, there might be an incomplete extraction, which could result in a weak or flat-tasting coffee. 3. Indirect effect: The slower flow of water through a thicker filter could make the process itself longer, meaning that it would take more time to brew a pot of coffee. This could have implications on the overall user experience and satisfaction with the coffee-making process. 4. Clogging issues: A thicker paper filter may be more prone to clogging, depending on the quality of the paper and the size of the coffee grounds. This could lead to the need for more frequent filter replacements or could even cause issues with the coffee maker's infrastructure and long-term functioning. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis regarding the use of a thicker paper filter does have an effect on the coffee-making process. The potential impacts involve changes to the speed of the brewing process, extraction efficiency and flavor, user experience, and coffee maker maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Do you have any strong opinion on co-educational or single-sex schools? A supporter of co-educational schools would probably say that schools should be like the societies they belong to .In Hong Kong , men and women mix socially on a day-to-day basis .In many fields men are even likely to have female bosses .It is ,therefore, desirable that boys and girls grow up together ,go to school together ,and prepare themselves for a society that does not value sexual separation. Some would go on to argue further that growing up with members of the opposite sex is important for personal development .Regular contact can remove the strange ideas about the opposite-sex and lead to more natural relationships .Single-sex conditions are seen as leading to more extreme opinions, and possibly even as encouraging homosexuality ,though there is no proof that this is the case. Those who are against coeducation often also fix their attention on the sexual side .Some parents fear that close contact with members of the opposite sex is dangerous for teenagers .They want their children to be attentive to their studies .Such parents feel uncomfortable with modern ways and the free mixing of the sexes. A stronger argument comes from research into school results .Girls grow up earlier than boys ,tend to be more orderly and are likely to be better at languages .In a mixed class ,boys who might do well in a single-sex class become discouraged and take on the rule of troublemaker .Certainly in the UK this situation has greatly alarmed the government for it to be encouraging co-educational schools to have some single-sex classes .In the UK the best schools are all single-sex ,strongly suggesting that co-education is not the best answer .This may ,however ,not be as simple as it looks .It may simply be that the famous old schools that attract the best students happen to be single-sex ,rather than that being single-sex makes them better schools.

The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan.

Analyze the hypothesis in relation to the premise. 3. Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation. Step 1: Understanding the premise: The premise states that one possible solution for Japan's problem is to assure borrowers of future inflation. In general, inflation leads to an increase in prices of goods and services, which means that borrowing money becomes more attractive as the effective cost of repaying it will be lower in the future due to its decreased value. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis in relation to the premise: The hypothesis is based on the premise and suggests that \\"Japan's problem can simply be solved by assuring borrowers that there will be inflation in the future.\\" This may suggest that creating expectations of future inflation would encourage borrowing, spending, and economic growth. Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation: While the premise and the hypothesis both focus on the idea of assuring borrowers of future inflation as a potential solution, it's essential to consider other factors that could influence Japan's economic situation (such as government policies, consumer behavior, and global market conditions). Therefore, the hypothesis oversimplifies the potential solution and does not take into account these other factors that may play a role in addressing Japan's problem.

After the summer, local festivals practically celebrate the richness of the county every weekend. From Egg Days, Tomato Festival to Seafood Festival, Sonoma County has something for everyone. An event held every year is one of the most special in the area, which celebrates the harvest of tomatoes, showing over 170 kinds of this tasty fruit. Cooks prepare the most favorite tomato-inspired dishes. You can enjoy all kinds of food while listening to live music, and taste the world famous Kendall Jackson wine.

Q:Information: - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

Paragraph: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

The comma after \\"psychiatrist\\" is used to separate two independent clauses that are joined by a coordinating conjunction (\\"and\\"). The second comma, after \\"sanatorium,\\" is used to set off the participial phrase (\\"recovering from depression\\") that provides additional information about the subject's time in the sanatorium. This use of commas enhances readability by indicating natural pauses in the sentence where the speaker would typically pause if the sentence were spoken aloud. Higher-level grammar rules also come into play here. According to some style guides, when you have two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction, you punctuate with a comma. Also, the comma before \\"recovering from depression\\" is known as an \\"offset comma,\\" which is used when the information is nonessential or could be dropped from the sentence without changing its basic meaning. In this case, the fact that he was \\"recovering from depression\\" just adds more color to the statement, but it is not necessary to understand the basic meaning, which is that he was treated by a psychiatrist and spent several months in a sanatorium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said. Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, was killed by police in the deadly attack Thursday night during a protest against police killings of African American men. Since the shooting deaths of two black men by white police officers over two days last week, protests have been held across the country. Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest. Police defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted. McKesson was freed on bond Sunday afternoon after being charged with obstructing a highway. \\"I remain disappointed in the Baton Rouge police, who continue to provoke protesters for peacefully protesting. There's a lot of work to be done, with this police department specifically,'' he said. But Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards disagreed with McKesson's assessment. The governor told a news conference Sunday that he is proud of the state's law enforcement officers, calling their response to the protests \\"moderate.\\" In the northern city of St. Paul, Minnesota, where a second man, Philando Castile, was shot to death last week by a policeman after a traffic stop for a broken tail light, hundreds of protesters hurled firecrackers, rocks and bottles at police on Saturday.

Here are possible answers to this question: - in the garden floor - rocks - books - bushes - garden I believe the correct choice is \\"books\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Books are indeed the correct choice when it comes to finding out more information about a type of lizard. While it is true that you could potentially encounter lizards in your garden, on rocks, or in bushes, these environments would only allow you to observe their physical appearance and some aspects of their behavior. To truly learn and understand more about a particular type of lizard, you would need to consult a reliable source of information. Books, especially those written by experts in the field of herpetology (the study of reptiles and amphibians), can provide a wealth of knowledge about different lizard species. Books offer several advantages over other information sources. Firstly, they often contain comprehensive information on various topics. In the case of a book about lizards, you could expect to find detailed descriptions of their physical characteristics, habitats, behaviors, diets, reproduction cycles, and more. Additionally, books are often well-researched and cite multiple references as sources, which lends credibility to the work and ensures that you receive accurate and reliable information. Apart from books, there are other reliable sources of information to learn about a type of lizard: 1. Scientific journals and articles: These resources often provide the latest information on lizard research and discoveries, as they are published by experts in the field. 2. Reputable websites: Many organizations and agencies dedicated to the study of reptiles and amphibians have websites where you can find useful information about lizards. Some examples include the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles (www.ssarherps.org) and the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (www.asih.org). 3. Museums and zoos: These institutions can provide a wealth of information about lizards through exhibits, guided tours, and educational materials. They may also have live specimens, which can give you an opportunity to observe lizards in a controlled environment. 4. Local herpetological societies: Many cities and regions have organizations dedicated to the study and conservation of reptiles and amphibians. Members of these societies can be excellent sources of information on local lizard species, and they may even host events or field trips where you can see lizards in their natural habitat. 5. Online forums and social media groups: There are many online communities where reptile enthusiasts and experts exchange information and share their knowledge about lizards. These platforms can be a great place to ask specific questions and receive advice from experienced individuals. In summary, while observing lizards in their natural habitats, such as gardens, rocks, and bushes, can provide some basic insights into their lives, books and other reliable sources of information offer a far more comprehensive and accurate understanding of lizard species, their behaviors, and their ecological roles.

Our son is going to be a sophomore in college this coming school year, and we’ve begun to contemplate whether it makes sense to move to a smaller home, maybe even a townhome. Our situation is kind of unique in the sense that we may go back to India after four more years in the United States and then live a hybrid life where we spend eight months in India and four months in the U.S. each year. One idea is to move to a townhome, stay there for three years and then rent it out once we move to India. If we decide to move we’ll need to spend about 25,000 in upgrades. It’s likely the new townhome may also need some upgrades and new appliances. With keeping all the upgrades and expenses in mind, would it make sense to just stay put for the next three to four years in our current house or should we sell and move? With the equity in the house, we may be able to either buy the townhome outright or quickly pay off the small mortgage that we take out for the townhome. You certainly packed a lot of issues in one question. We’ll start with your current home and your current loan. You recently paid several thousand dollars to refinance your loan and you have a great interest rate on that loan. So your housing expenses are probably quite low. We imagine the issue is that your large home has other expenses that would be higher than they would in a smaller home or a townhome. It probably costs more to cool, clean and care for a large home, not to mention paying the property tax bill. As you scale down, your heating and cooling bills should go down as should some of the other expenses of maintaining the home. Financially, it appears you have the income to support staying or going. Given the cost of moving, and the repairs and upgrades you plan to make in both homes, you have to think about which home you’d rather rent: a large family home or a smaller townhouse. [More Matters: How to handle your downstairs condo neighbor who complains about your noisy footsteps] One issue for you to ponder is why you’d want to be a landlord in the United States if you plan to live most of the year in India. If it’s for the investment in real estate, then you have to evaluate the townhome as an investment and determine if having that investment is right for you. Certainly, if you are living in India, you’re not going to be readily available to handle tenant issues or handle the ordinary affairs of owning a piece of real estate. You would need to hire someone to manage the property and handle those issues that you, as a landlord, won’t be able to handle on the other side of the world. If you rent your townhouse (or single-family home), where do you plan to live when you do come back to the United States? From the limited information you have given to us, we don’t know why you would want to go through the expense of handling all the repairs needed to your home only to sell it and then handle all the upgrades and repairs you anticipate in the smaller townhome you might buy. We believe that if you make upgrades and improvements to a home, you might as well stay and enjoy them for a while. If you make those improvements, yes, you’ll have higher expenses in owning your current home. But you’d be smart to calculate what those expenses are relative to the townhome. If the difference isn’t as big as you thought, you might continue to enjoy your home for the next several years. [More Matters: Why purchasing a home at auction can be risky] Of course, as we said, much of your issues are not financially but emotionally driven. So you have to sit down, write down what you like about living in your home, how a move to a different home would affect you, your wife and your son, how it affects your finances and if the effect on your finances is greater than the benefit you get out of keeping the home. If, after you analyze your situation, you find that the financial burden of owning your larger existing home is too great and the benefits to you of having a smaller townhome for the next several years are likely much greater, then consider moving. But we aren’t big fans of buying a townhome now for your future ability to rent it out and become landlords. You’ll need to give that some thought and see if being a landlord is what you really want to be.

Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own. A:","completion":"The sister of the twins' mother is Connie.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality? Options: - After not consuming salt for more than 48 hours. - not enough information - When high amounts of salt were added during processing. - When sweet and fatty foods were offered at breakfast. A:","completion":"When high amounts of salt were added during processing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To answer these questions, I will provide various methods to potentially increase height, especially for a 14-year-old who may still be growing. Step 1: Analyze the age factor - At the age of 14, a person may still be experiencing growth spurts. It is important to acknowledge that their height will naturally increase as they grow older. Step 2: Recommend healthy nutrition - Encourage a well-balanced diet, rich in proteins, calcium, vitamins, and minerals. This will support the growth process and the development of strong bones and muscles. Step 3: Suggest regular exercises and sports - Recommend engaging in regular physical activities, especially sports like basketball, swimming, and jumping. These exercises will help strengthen bones, improve posture, and facilitate growth. Step 4: Acknowledge the importance of sleep - Encourage the user to get an adequate amount of sleep, as this is when the body releases growth hormones. Around 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night is ideal for a 14-year-old. Step 5: Address the role of genetics - Inform the user that genetics plays a significant role in determining height, and it is important to set realistic expectations for growth. Step 6: Suggest medical advice - If the user is concerned about their height or thinks there may be an underlying growth issue, they should consult with a medical professional for personalized advice. By following these steps, I am providing methods to potentially increase height, especially for a 14-year-old who may still be growing.

The Zombies - \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (1967): Despite being a critical success, The Zombies' baroque pop masterpiece, \\"Care of Cell 44,\\" never achieved mainstream popularity. 2. Love - \\"Alone Again Or\\" (1967): This beautiful melodic track from the band Love never achieved the same level of popularity as other songs of the time, but it has developed a passionate following among fans of psychedelic rock. 3. Fred Neil - \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" (1966): Originally written and recorded by Fred Neil, this introspective folk song gained more popularity after being covered by Harry Nilsson for the Midnight Cowboy soundtrack. 4. The Pretty Things - \\"S.F. Sorrow\\" (1968): This is the first known concept album in rock history and showcases a haunting and atmospheric soundscape, but it failed to gather the same attention as The Who's \\"Tommy.\\" 5. The Left Banke - \\"Walk Away Renee\\" (1966): A fine example of baroque pop, this beautiful track didn't achieve the same level of success as other songs of the time. Lesser-known musical gems from the 2000s: 1. The Coral - \\"Dreaming of You\\" (2002): A catchy and energetic indie-rock song that showcases this British band's unique style, \\"Dreaming of You\\" is an underappreciated tune from the early 2000s. 2. Stars - \\"Your Ex-Lover is Dead\\" (2004): A beautifully arranged chamber-pop track with hauntingly poetic lyrics, this song from the Canadian band Stars is a clear indication of their talent. 3. Midlake - \\"Roscoe\\" (2006): A folk-rock gem with a beautiful melody and layered harmonies, \\"Roscoe\\" is a prime example of lesser-known brilliance from the indie music scene in the 2000s. 4. The Rapture - \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" (2002): A track that blends punk, funk, and disco in a dynamic and infectious manner, \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" is a genuine testament to the creativity of the post-punk revival in the early 2000s. 5. Aesop Rock - \\"None Shall Pass\\" (2007): This underground hip-hop track features intricate wordplay and dense, vivid storytelling. Aesop Rock's \\"None Shall Pass\\" is an overlooked gem in the world of independent rap. These are just a few examples of the many lesser-known musical treasures from the 1960s and the 2000s.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?","completion":"Sample D, being classified as autotrophic, would make its own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Autotrophic organisms do not acquire glucose from other organisms; they produce it themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge.

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest hunger rate. But according to a new report, African farmers also have ideas that could help the world fight hunger and poverty. Danielle Nierenberg from the Worldwatch Institute in Washington spent a year visiting twenty-five countries south of the Sahara. In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, Ms Nierenberg found women farmers growing vegetables just outside their doorsteps in the Kibera settlement. She says they are finding ways to make their lives better. The women feed their families and sell their _ They use the money to send their children to school. Last year, about 925,000,000 people worldwide did not get enough to eat. Half of all people in the world now live in and around cities. Researchers like Ms Nierenberg are looking increasingly at creative ideas to feed those who don't have enough good food to eat. She says there are a lot of lessons that people in the Western world can learn from Africa. And what they are doing can certainly be done in other developing countries. Farmers in the developing world lose between twenty and forty percent of their harvest before it ever reaches market. There are many reasons why food gets wasted. Farmers are without electricity and cold storage. They lack good seeds and fertilizer. They lack good roads. Conditions like these keep small farmers in poverty. Ms Nierenberg says more attention needs to be paid to protecting harvests. She says, \\"Given all that we invest in producing food in the first place, we need to devote the same amount of attention to making sure that it is not wasted.\\" In Nigeria, village processing centers are helping farmers reduce their losses and earn more money. They centers process cassava, a root vegetable, into basic food products. In Uganda, the Worldwatch report says some schools are teaching children how to grow local kinds of crops. And in South Africa and Kenya the report praises the breeding of local kinds of livestock. These animals may produce less milk or meat than other breeds, but they can...

He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested, but was soon released.

Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample would less likely be used as fuel, sample C or sample D? The answer is:","completion":"Sample C, which is U-238, is less likely to be used as fuel compared to Sample D, which is U-235. Here's why: U-235 and U-238 are isotopes of uranium. The difference between these isotopes lies in the number of neutrons they have in their atomic nuclei, which further affects some of their physical properties and their utility in various applications. U-235 is a fissile isotope, meaning it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, making it useful as a fuel in nuclear reactors and also in the production of nuclear weapons. When a neutron hits the nucleus of a U-235 atom, the nucleus splits, releasing a great deal of energy (this is nuclear fission), along with additional neutrons that can then split other U-235 atoms, perpetuating the chain reaction. On the other hand, U-238, the most common isotope of uranium found in nature, is not fissile, it's fertile. It doesn't readily undergo fission, that means it cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the same way. Instead, when hit by neutrons, U-238 becomes U-239, which eventually, through a series of decays, becomes plutonium-239, a fissile material. So in simple terms, U-235 can be used directly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor, while U-238 cannot. However, it's important to note that U-238 can be turned into a usable fuel (Pu-239) through a series of reactions in a reactor. It's just that in its initial state, U-238 is not directly usable as a fuel, hence it is less likely to be used as a fuel in comparison to U-235."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dans certaines situations, les sociétés qui concluent des conventions comportant des actions accréditives peuvent reclasser des montants limités de frais d'aménagement au Canada (habituellement une déduction de 30 % sur un solde décroissant) à titre de frais d'exploration au Canada. Translate to English","completion":"In some situations, companies that enter into agreements involving flow-through shares may be allowed to reclassify limited amounts of Canadian development expenses (usually a 30% deduction on a declining balance) as Canadian exploration expenses. Flow-through shares are a unique investment and financing mechanism prevalent in the Canadian resource sector, particularly in the mining and oil and gas industries. They provide companies with a way to transfer eligible expenses to their investors, who can then use these expenses to offset their own taxable income. When a company incurs Canadian development expenses (CDE) or Canadian exploration expenses (CEE), they can usually deduct these costs from their own taxable income. However, by issuing flow-through shares, the company can transfer the right to deduct the eligible expenses to their investors. This can make flow-through shares particularly attractive to investors who have a significant taxable income. As mentioned in the original text, in certain situations, a company may be allowed to reclassify limited amounts of Canadian development expenses as Canadian exploration expenses. This reclassification is generally subject to the company's agreement with the investor and the relevant Canadian tax rules. While both CDE and CEE can provide tax deductions to investors, the CEE offers more favorable tax treatment. Typically, CDE allows for a 30% deduction on a declining balance, while CEE deductions are generally granted on a 100% basis in the year they are incurred. The purpose of allowing such reclassification is to incentivize investment in the exploration and development of the Canadian natural resource sector. By providing more tax advantages to investors, these companies can attract additional capital for their projects, thereby fostering growth in the industry. In summary, the reclassification of limited amounts of Canadian development expenses as Canadian exploration expenses is a possible scenario in certain situations involving flow-through shares. This reclassification typically aims to create a more attractive investment environment for investors, leading to further growth and development in the Canadian resource sector."},{"prompt":"USS Nokomis (SP-609) - USS Nokomis (SP-609) was a yacht purchased by the U.S. Navy during World War I.

(CNN) -- Scientists say they have proven the existence of the Higgs boson -- a never-before-seen subatomic particle long thought to be a fundamental building block of the universe. Since 2012 researchers have made great strides in the hunt for the so-called \\"God particle\\" at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists at the CERN particle physics laboratory are looking for particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies. Experts say finding the elusive particle would rank as one of the top scientific achievements of the past 50 years -- a view proved on Tuesday when Francois Englert and Peter Higgs, the two physicists who predicted almost 50 years ago that the particle existed, won the Nobel Prize in Physics. \\"Only now with the LHC [ OPTIONS: - CERN] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - CNN] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Francois Englert] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Geneva] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - God] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Higgs boson] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Large Hadron Collider] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Nobel Prize in Physics] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Peter Higgs] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Switzerland] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\"","completion":"Large Hadron Collider] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" The discovery of the Higgs boson has provided key insights into the nature of the universe and could help physicists understand other fundamental questions like the nature of dark matter and the origins of the universe itself. The Higgs field, associated with the Higgs boson, is believed to give particles mass through interaction with this invisible field. \\"The Higgs boson has long been considered the missing cornerstone of our understanding of the universe, and now we can finally confirm that it indeed exists,\\" said CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer. \\"This is an incredible achievement for science, and it has only been possible through the collaboration of researchers from around the world working together on the Large Hadron Collider project.\\" This monumental discovery could not have happened without the tireless efforts of thousands of researchers and engineers working together at CERN. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a 17-mile-long underground ring, is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. By smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light, scientists have been able to observe high-energy collisions that release particles like the Higgs boson. The confirmation of the Higgs boson's existence not only validates the current understanding of particle physics, the so-called Standard Model, but it also opens up new avenues for further research. The discovery has the potential to pave the way for advancements in technology, medicine, and possibly even new sources of energy in the future. As impressive as this discovery is, it must be remembered that our understanding of the universe is continually evolving. Physicists are now focusing on studying the Higgs boson in more detail to gain deeper insights into how it interacts with other particles and possibly uncover more undiscovered particles. This could eventually lead to the development of new theories that challenge and refine our knowledge of the universe's inner workings. In conclusion, the discovery of the Higgs boson is a significant milestone in human history and has major implications for our understanding of the universe. The completion of this news story with 'Large Hadron Collider' emphasizes the importance of the cutting-edge technology and international collaboration that made this monumental discovery possible. Ultimately, the study of the Higgs boson will continue to propel the field of particle physics forward, enabling us to unravel the mysteries of the universe we inhabit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:If a human only has 45 chromosomes it is most likely due to a mistake during what? Solution:","completion":"If a human only has 45 chromosomes, it is most likely due to a mistake during the process of meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division responsible for the production of sex cells (sperm and eggs) in sexually reproducing organisms. During meiosis, the normal chromosome number (46 in humans) is halved, resulting in haploid cells with 23 chromosomes each. These haploid cells later combine during fertilization to form a diploid zygote with the full complement of 46 chromosomes. A person with 45 chromosomes likely has a condition called monosomy, which occurs when a chromosome is missing from one of the pairs in an otherwise diploid set of chromosomes. This can result from errors during one of the two main stages of meiosis, known as meiosis I and meiosis II. 1. Meiosis I: This stage starts with a diploid (2n) cell that undergoes DNA replication, resulting in duplicated chromosomes (each consisting of two identical sister chromatids). The chromosomes then pair up with their homologous partners, forming tetrads. Through a process called crossing over, the homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, increasing genetic diversity. Subsequently, the homologous chromosome pairs are separated, and the cell divides into two haploid (n) daughter cells, each with 23 duplicated chromosomes. An error during meiosis I might result in non-disjunction, which occurs when homologous chromosomes (or sister chromatids) fail to separate correctly. If this happens, one of the resulting daughter cells might receive an extra chromosome, leaving the other with one less. 2. Meiosis II: During this stage, the haploid daughter cells from meiosis I go through a second round of cell division. The chromatids of each chromosome are separated, resulting in the formation of four haploid (n) cells, each with 23 single-stranded chromosomes. These cells will ultimately become sperm or egg cells. Errors during meiosis II can also lead to non-disjunction, causing an uneven distribution of chromosomes in the resulting gametes. If a gamete missing a chromosome subsequently participates in fertilization, the resulting zygote will have only 45 chromosomes. This can lead to various health issues and developmental abnormalities, depending on which chromosome is affected."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Marching percussion instruments are specially designed to be played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics to sling their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums). The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. Articulation is paramount to producing a \\"clean\\" sound from all the drummers in the line. These instruments are used by marching bands, drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a drumline or battery.

Not many people write out reports anymore, they only use paper by loading it into the what? - office supply store - classroom - typewriter - computer printer - artist's studio The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is A: computer printer. In today's technologically advanced world, the traditional method of writing reports by hand has become less common. Instead, people use computers and electronic devices to create documents more efficiently, and these digital documents are often printed using a computer printer. Although other options mentioned like the office supply store, classroom, typewriter, and artist's studio all involve paper usage, they are not directly related to how the majority of people generate and print reports in the modern context. An office supply store sells various items necessary for offices and businesses, including paper and printer supplies. However, people generally do not write or print reports directly at the supply store. A classroom is a learning environment where students and teachers engage in educational activities. While students may use paper to take notes or complete assignments, the classroom itself does not print reports. However, schools and educational institutions may have computer labs or printing facilities available for students to print documents as needed. A typewriter is an old-fashioned device used to type letters and documents. While it can also produce written reports on paper, very few people use typewriters nowadays due to the prevalence of computers and digital technology. An artist's studio is a space where artists create their artwork. These individuals may use paper for drawing, painting, or creating other types of art pieces. However, this setting is not typically associated with generating and printing reports or other business-related documents. Conclusively, the best answer is a computer printer since it accurately represents the primary method through which people create and print reports in the digital age.

The CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the Agency's executive director, A. B.\\" Buzzy\\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he. Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle.

Klitschko has already fought in the US a dozen times but Joshua, who looks destined to follow the likes of Lewis into US-based super bouts, is yet to fight professionally outside of the UK. \\"He has the ultimate test,\\" added Hearn. \\"A test which should come maybe after 27 or 28 fights. Why risk it now? He wants to challenge himself. Is he the guy everyone talks about as the future of boxing?\\" Joshua's procession to a world title - captured in just 34 career rounds when he floored American Charles Martin in 2016 - has led to him being installed as odds-on-favourite against Klitschko with bookmakers. He has contested just 44 rounds as a professional, a tally surpassed by Klitschko in his last five fights alone, with the 41-year-old Ukrainian hardened by 358 rounds as a pro, spanning 68 fights, 64 wins and more than 20 years. Indeed, London 2012 gold medallist Joshua was only six when Klitschko topped the podium at the 1996 Atlanta Games. In the pro game, he has felt the heat of a world title fight three times, this will be Klitschko's 29th. With both men similar in stature, the gap in age and experience has been central to much of the pre-fight debate. Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken said: \\"As good as Klitschko has been, Father Time is a terrible person when he shows up and I think he already has. \\"It is going to be tough for Wladimir, he doesn't know himself if it's still there or not. He's against a ferocious opponent on Saturday night, that's for sure.\\" Klitschko can be destructive too. His tally of 53 knockouts surpasses the great Joe Louis by one and the wrecking ball that was Mike Tyson by nine. In 2013, he dropped the respected Alexander Povetkin four times. The Russian had never lost and has not done so since. Klitschko is adamant his career will not fade after defeat to Fury and he has come back from torment before after losing world title fights to the likes of Corrie Sanders in 2003 and Lamon Brewster a year later. \\"Nobody is perfect,\\" Klitschko's brother Vitali told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"Everyone has strong sides and weak sides.

Reaction drills such as dodging agility sticks to chase tennis balls, intense sessions on a watt bike and workouts in a leg-sapping sand pit have all been captured on camera. The hard work calls for a diet of between 4,000 and 5,000 calories a day - a stark difference to NHS guidelines of 2,500 for men.

May 20, 2014, 11:42 PM GMT / Updated May 21, 2014, 12:00 AM GMT Five men were convicted Tuesday in Moscow in the 2006 execution-style murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Russian state media reported. Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter for the liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta who worked almost full-time on documenting allegations of human rights violations in the breakaway province of Chechnya, was 48 when she was gunned down in the elevator of her apartment building in October 2006. The murder raised worldwide questions about freedom of speech and of the press under Russian President Vladimir Putin — especially after three of the defendants were initially acquitted in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned those acquittals and ordered a new trial. ||||| People hold portraits of slain journalist Anna Politkovskaya on the sixth anniversary of her death, next to her block of flats in central Moscow October 7, 2012. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Five men were convicted on Tuesday of murdering 2006 of investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya, including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial. Politkovskaya's killing drew attention to the risks faced by Russians who challenge the authorities and deepened Western concerns for the rule of law under President Vladimir Putin, who was then serving his second term. Another jury's 2009 acquittal of three of the men who were found guilty of murder on Tuesday embarrassed Russian prosecutors and was later thrown out by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial. The defendants were three Chechen brothers, one of whom was accused of shooting Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006, as well as their uncle and a former police officer. The convictions are a victory for Russian prosecutors and the state, but rights activists and relatives of Politkovskaya say that justice will not be done until those who ordered her contract-style killing are identified and convicted. \\"The murder will only be solved when the name of the person who ordered it is known,\\" a lawyer for Politkovskaya's family, Anna Stavitskaya, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. She welcomed the jury's verdict but said the men found guilty \\"are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice\\", RIA reported. A spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the authorities were doing all they can to identify and track down the person behind the killing, Russian news agencies reported. Kremlin critics say they doubt that will ever happen because of suspicions the trail could lead too close to the government. Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who was 48 when she was shot dead while returning home after shopping for groceries, was best known for her dogged reporting on human rights violations in the North Caucasus province of Chechnya. Lawyers for the defendants - Rustam Makhmudov, his brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail, their uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov - said they would appeal. Investigators say Gaitukayev organised the logistics of the killing while in jail for another matter, while Khadzhikurbanov was in charge of preparing for the slaying and Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov helped track her. Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and Khadzhikurbanov were previously acquitted. The five men will be sentenced by a judge at a later date and could face life in prison. Prosecutors will recommend sentences at a court session on Wednesday, RIA reported.

One man was found guilty of the shooting and the other four of organising the killing. Three of the men were brothers from Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya, a 48-year-old investigative reporter and vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, was shot in a lift in her block of flats. Three of the men had been acquitted of the murder in a 2009 trial. The initial verdict was overturned by Russia's supreme court, which ordered their retrial. One of the brothers, Rustam Makhmudov, was found guilty of pulling the trigger. His brothers were found guilty of acting as getaway drivers. The brothers' uncle and a retired policeman were also found guilty of organising the killing. Ms Politkovskaya's reporting for Novaya Gazeta newspaper won international renown for her dogged investigation of Russian abuses in Chechnya. But her pieces, which were highly critical of President Vladimir Putin, then serving his second term, and the Chechen leadership, angered many in authority. The five men, who face possible life terms, will be sentenced on Wednesday morning. A committee set up to investigate the shooting said it was still looking for the person who ordered the operation. Her family welcomed the verdict but also expressed disappointment that the mastermind of the killing had not yet been found. Last year a former police officer, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for supplying the murder weapon. Magnitsky sanctions In a separate development, the US announced on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions on a further 12 Russians believed to be involved in the death of a Moscow lawyer in 2009. Sergei Magnitsky found evidence of a 230m tax-refund fraud Sergei Magnitsky died in prison, allegedly because of torture and neglect, after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud. Following his death, the US passed the Magnitsky Act, aimed at punishing officials involved in his death, and last year published a list of 18 individuals banned from entering the country. Among the names added to the list on Tuesday are three doctors alleged to have withheld treatment from Magnitsky while he was in custody. One of them, Larisa Litvinova, was chief physician at Butyrka maximum security jail where Magnitksy died while another, Dmitry Kratov, was its deputy director. A judge involved in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky for tax fraud has also been added to the sanctions list.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Now, I have a new situation: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. Answer this question please: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? A:","completion":"Given the background information provided, apples retained their quality longer than peaches. This is because apples were among the fruits Dan decided to candy, while peaches were left fresh for the family to enjoy. Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, undergoes a process of preservation where the fruit is placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. This process can take from several days to several months, depending on the size and type of fruit, and allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure this creates. Since the apples were candied and the peaches were left fresh, the preservation process extended the shelf life of the apples. Fresh fruits, such as peaches in this case, don't undergo the same preservation process and thus will not last as long as their candied counterparts. Fresh fruits will generally last a few days to a couple of weeks at most, depending on how they are stored. Consequently, the candied apples retained their quality longer than the fresh peaches."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Teddy Bears have been a very popular children's toy for many years. Most adults can remember their first stuffed bear, and over the decades these toys have become nearly a symbol of their childhood. However, children are not the only ones with whom these toys have become popular, as many adults make it a habit to collect these toys as well. The Teddy Bear first became popular during the early 20th century and was associated with then President Theodore Roosevelt. The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called \\"Teddy's bear\\". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were \\"the\\" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand. However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them. Walk through just about any toy store in America and you will find dozens of different teddy bears lining the shelves. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Answer: A:","completion":"The passage is mainly about the history, popularity, and enduring significance of Teddy Bears as children's toys and collectibles for adults. It highlights how the Teddy Bear's origins are connected to President Theodore Roosevelt and how they became a global phenomenon in the 20th century. The passage also discusses the difference between mass-produced and handmade teddy bears and their impact on the toy industry, generating over a billion dollars a year in profits."},{"prompt":"Question: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In ‘Godzilla,’ San Francisco is in for a big surprise Director Gareth Edwards got the challenging assignment to update Godzilla on the strength of his 2010 debut, “Monsters,” a less-is-more indie that showed that marauding behemoths could actually still be scary. As Edwards also demonstrated, this was particularly true when the human drama was strong enough to make us care. “Godzilla” skillfully applies the same dynamic — for a stretch. This latest bid to Hollywoodize a uniquely Japanese icon is an uneven spectacle that can’t sustain its solid first-half character moments. But the movie can also flash a surprising, often clever sense of legacy, and is intermittently capable of thrilling us. The film opens by establishing, emphatically, that the character’s still relevant origins as a nuclear-anxiety metaphor haven’t been forgotten. It’s 1999. Exacting, Japan-based engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is sweating reactor issues — apparently with good cause, as some seismic anomaly (guess what?) triggers a meltdown. It ends badly for Joe’s engineer wife (Juliette Binoche), in a scene that’s the high point of some absorbing early drama — Edwards again flexing his tonal muscles, and delivering the movie that audiences seemingly craved when 1998’s size-does-matter “Godzilla” tanked. Fifteen years later, the couple’s grown son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of “Kick-Ass,” all hunky concern and practiced city-tough accent), is an Army bomb-squad specialist living in San Francisco. Determined to lead a normal life with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and his own young son, Ford has stashed his family tragedy in the hurt locker (sorry). But he’s exasperatedly pulled back in by Joe, who’s still in Japan and playing conspiracy nut, in a nice variation on Walter White’s dark metamorphic spiral. Joe’s suspicions are proven right, of course, as a mysterious cocoon cracks open at the reactor site-turned-research facility, and the creature-feature mayhem finally gets underway. Spoiler alert: The monster that busts loose isn’t Godzilla, but some species of fanged, EMP-spouting locust — or maybe a neo-Rodan, to fanboys — that the movie showcases as fondly as its star. Still, the scramble for containment soon alerts scientists (Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins) and the military (David Strathairn, sporting a brush cut) to Godzilla’s presence as well. So begins an odyssey of tracking the creatures, first to Honolulu, then inexorably on to San Francisco, with Taylor-Johnson’s hero leading the way. Bomb tech, crack shot, paratrooper — he’s a super-er super solider than Captain America. Meanwhile, a second, frisky quasi-locust begins making its way there, from Nevada nuclear-disposal territory, via Las Vegas. Efficient planning when you want to trash Paris, New York-New York, and a pyramid, in addition to the Golden Gate. Crafted with motion-capture technology and an aesthetic eye toward tradition, Godzilla is convincingly rendered here, making for some genuinely electrifying moments. There’s the monster’s battleship-buffeting partial reveal. That initial footfall, and the way it instantly communicates the Godzilla’s impossible scale. That initial blast of his radioactive dragon’s-breath, and a stunning encore. You take in these moments, and you imagine this must be what it felt like to catch the original at a Saturday matinee in the 1950s. Still, the third-act brawl between Godzilla and the other two kaiju titans is overkill, a case of Edwards’s budget-necessitated “Monsters” restraint getting chucked right out. It’s interesting that Edwards honors Godzilla’s history to the point that he’s even willing to mine the character’s post-’50s reinvention as fearsome protector. But the more the movie indulges this aspect, the more it really needs performances that ground it — and they’re just not coming from Taylor-Johnson, Watanabe, and the rest of the thespian soldiers and flabbergasted biologists who dominate the second hour. Godzilla, Watanabe breathlessly hypothesizes, “is here to restore balance.” The film could do with a little of that itself, thrills notwithstanding. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"\\"Godzilla\\" is a movie about a big monster who causes problems in San Francisco.

Gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), or hydrogen sulfide (H2S), termed gasotransmitters, play an increasingly important role in understanding of how electrical signaling of cells is modulated. H2S is well-known to act on various ion channels and receptors. In a previous study we reported that H2S increased calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel activity.', 'The goal of the present study is to investigate the modulatory effect of BK channel phosphorylation on the action of H2S on the channel as well as to recalculate and determine the H2S concentrations in aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) solutions.', 'Single channel recordings of GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells were used to analyze channel open probability, amplitude, and open dwell times. H2S was measured with an anion selective electrode.', 'The concentration of H2S produced from NaHS was recalculated taking pH, temperature salinity of the perfusate, and evaporation of H2S into account. The results indicate that from a concentration of 300 μM NaHS, only 11-13%, i.e., 34-41 μM is effective as H2S in solution. GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells respond differently to phosphorylation. BK channel open probability (Po) of all cells lines used was increased by H2S in ATP-containing solutions. PKA prevented the action of H2S on channel Po in GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not in GH3 cells. H2S, high significantly increased Po of all PKG pretreated cells. In the presence of PKC, which lowers channel activity, H2S increased channel Po of GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not those of GH3 cells.

Explanation: The correct answer is to spray an acrylic sealer onto the frosted window once it has completely dried. This is because acrylic sealers are effective at protecting the frost from moisture, wear and tear, and UV light damage. It also helps in maintaining the frosted effect for a longer period. The other option, spraying shellac sealer, is incorrect because shellac sealers are not as effective as acrylic sealers in protecting frosted surfaces. They may provide some protection, but they can also become brittle and may not adhere as well to the frosted window, which can lead to a less durable and less attractive finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both made great progress. Which person didn't observe that the climate becomes colder at high elevations? Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. A:","completion":"In this scenario, Jerry studies alpine climate, which is characterized by the climate becoming colder at high elevations. This is described by the lapse rate of air, where air tends to get colder as it rises due to expansion. On the other hand, James studies tropical climates, which are characterized by hot, humid weather and relatively consistent temperatures throughout the year, with less variation associated with elevation changes. Given the information provided and the hint that alpine climate involves the climate becoming colder at high elevations, it is clear that James, the meteorologist studying tropical climates, did not observe the phenomenon that the climate becomes colder at high elevations. His focus is on the consistently warm and humid conditions near the equator, where the impact of elevation on temperature may be less apparent or not as significant as in alpine climate zones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:Kingfisher has confirmed to the market that the €275m (£200m) deal, first announced last year, would not proceed. The company already owns the Castorama chain in France and the deal depended on regulatory approval. It emerged last week that some Mr Bricolage shareholders opposed the deal. Shares in Kingfisher rose 3.1%, or 11.1p, to 368.9p in afternoon trading in London, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. The company is worth more than £8.5bn. ANPF, an organisation controlled by Mr Bricolage franchisees that holds almost 42% of the retailer's shares, last week decided to oppose the deal. Kingfisher had set a deadline of 31 March for regulatory approval of the takeover. \\"Notwithstanding Kingfisher's efforts to pursue the completion of the transaction, and in light of the positions expressed to date by the ANPF and Mr Bricolage, the anti-trust clearance will not be obtained by 31 March 2015 and therefore the July 2014 agreement will lapse on that date,\\" the company said on Monday. \\"Consequently the transaction will not proceed. Kingfisher is considering all of its options.\\" Some Mr Bricolage franchisees are understood to fear the store closures that would be required for Kingfisher to win regulatory approval of the takeover. The failure of the deal is a blow to Veronique Laury, the former Castorama boss who took over from Sir Ian Cheshire as chief executive last September. She will preside over her first set of annual results for Kingfisher on Tuesday. Andrew Hughes, a UBS analyst, expects pre-tax profits to be 10% lower than 2013 at £670m. Challenges facing Ms Laury include reducing the amount of floorspace occupied by B&Q stores and generating further growth in Europe following the collapse of the Mr Bricolage deal.

This small city is located in the northeastern part of the state and was chosen due to its rural landscape, architecture, and suitable locations that matched the fictional setting of the film, Calumet, Colorado. The city's picturesque scenery and historic buildings allowed the production to create a believable small-town atmosphere for the movie. Various specific locations in and around Las Vegas, New Mexico, were used during the filming, including: 1. Las Vegas Plaza: The Las Vegas Plaza was used for several outdoor scenes, including the iconic opening sequence where paratroopers descend onto the streets and the high school kids witness the invasion. 2. Fourth Street Bridge: The Fourth Street Bridge is a prominent location featured in the movie. In one of the most famous scenes, the iconic 'Wolverines!' battle cry is shouted by the film’s lead characters. 3. West Las Vegas High School: Formerly known as Robertson High School, this location was used for both exterior and interior shots of the school. The building can still be spotted today and is easily recognizable from the film. 4. Hermanos Lopez Ranch: Located about 25 miles from Las Vegas, this ranch served as the location for the fictional guerrilla training camp used by the main characters in the movie. 5. Gallinas River: Scenes involving the Gallinas River were filmed on location, particularly those depicting the main characters' life in hiding, and their crossing of the river. 6. Fox Peak Gas Station: This old gas station was used in the scene where a Russian tank stops, and the characters attempt to obtain fuel. 7. Storrie Lake State Park: Located about 5 miles north of Las Vegas, Storrie Lake State Park was utilized for shooting some of the outdoor scenes featuring the main characters' guerrilla activities, such as the sabotage of the gas station. 8. Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park: Situated in Angel Fire, New Mexico, around 55 miles northeast of Las Vegas, this park was used for filming the climax of the movie and the scene where American Colonel Tanner meets the \\"Wolverines.\\" Overall, the locations in and around Las Vegas, New Mexico, allowed the film's production to create a convincing portrayal of a small-town USA invaded and occupied by foreign forces. The area's rural setting, diverse landscapes, and blend of historic and modern buildings provided the perfect backdrop for the movie's fictional narrative. To this day, some of the filming locations used in the original \\"Red Dawn\\" remain recognizable and attract visitors who are fans of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of this story, Carol Field is probably A:","completion":"an expert in Italian baking and the author of The Italian Baker, a favorite baking book for Italian specialties.

Write highlights for this article: Leeds president Massimo Cellino arrived back in the United Kingdom in defiant mood on Tuesday and told the Football League it had 'made a big mistake' in disqualifying him from owning the club. Cellino was holding talks in Bahrain with the club's former owner Gulf Finance House - the investment bank still control 25 per cent of the club's shares - when the Football League announced on Monday the Italian had failed its 'owners and directors' test'. The league told Cellino he must stand down after finally receiving further evidence of dishonesty from the Italian judge who convicted him for tax evasion in March. Massimo Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park back in September. It was all quiet outside Elland Road on Monday as the statements were released. Hollywood actor Verne Troyer (centre) poses with Cellino's daughter Eleonora at Elland Road on Saturday. The 58-year-old will be entitled to return to his position at the club on March 18 next year when the conviction is spent under UK law. The league has said Cellino had 14 days to lodge an appeal. 'I don't want to spend a lot of money on lawyers,' Cellino told ITV. 'This club in the last five years has spent more money on lawyers than players.' When asked to confirm he will appeal, Cellino said: 'Sure. I'm going to meet my lawyers. They (Football League) have made a big mistake. 'They're just throwing money from the window.' Cellino took control of Leeds in April when his family company, Eleanora Sport Limited, bought 75 per cent of the club's shares from GFH. The former Cagliari owner announced a new £20million investment in Leeds on Saturday and said he had successfully negotiated a £5million contribution from GFH after meeting with the investment bank's officials in Bahrain. The statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner stands proud outside the famous old ground. Leeds' players celebrate Mirco Antenucci's strike in the 2-1 win over league leaders Derby on Saturday. We have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until March 18 2015. The club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League’s Professional Conduct Committee in April 2014. The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. Cellino added: 'I solved a big problem (on Monday) in Bahrain. It was important for the survival of this club. This club now is financially strong, it looks to the future and we're going to present the facts. 'We're going to fix the club and the league is going to realise it's doing a big mistake.' The league initially attempted to block Cellino's takeover of Leeds after his tax conviction in April, but the Italian successfully appealed. But the judge who over-ruled the league's decision, Tim Kerr QC, said if it was later concluded that Cellino had acted dishonestly when failing to pay import duty on his yacht, he would fail the 'owners' and directors' test'. Cellino faces a second similar charge of tax evasion on another yacht. The latest court case in Sardinia was adjourned in late October and it is understood a new date has yet to be confirmed. The league has also asked an independent disciplinary commission to consider whether Cellino breached league regulations by not disclosing information it had obtained from the Sardinian court which convicted him in March. Press Association Sport understands there is no time limit on the commission's findings as this further breach of its rules is an entirely separate process. It is also understood that Eleanora Sport could install a new management structure at Elland Road to satisfy the league that Cellino has no financial or executive influence on the club during his disqualification period. The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test. Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone). In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.” Cellino watches Leeds take on QPR back in March before his takeover had been completed. At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test. Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public. Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course. Editors notes:. * Shaun Harvey was Chief Executive and a Director of Leeds United between 2004 and 2013. Cellino is pictured at Millwall back in August. He has sacked two managers since then.

A widely reported 2016 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association compared homicide rates in Florida following the passage of its \`\`stand your ground'' self-defense law to the rates in four control states, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia, which have no similar laws. It found that the law was associated with a 24.4% increase in homicide and a 31.6% increase in firearm-related homicide, but no change in rates of suicide or suicide by firearm, between 2005 and 2014. It noted that, \`\`(c)ircumstances unique to Florida may have contributed to our findings, including those that we could not identify,'' and \`\`(o)ur study examined the effect of the Florida law on homicide and homicide by firearm, not on crime and public safety''. The study was criticized by gun rights advocate John Lott's Crime Prevention Research Center for studying only one state. Gun enthusiast and attorney Andrew Branca, writing in National Review, criticized the study for not distinguishing between justifiable homicides and murder, and for relying solely on statutory laws while overlooking case law (i.e. Virginia) in determining the data set.

Movie title: Cape Fear Context: Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a lawyer in the quiet town of New Essex, North Carolina. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Cape Fear, Max Cady (Robert De Niro), the antagonist, files a restraining order against Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), the protagonist. This happens after Bowden, the lawyer who once defended Cady and buried evidence against him, attempts to have Cady arrested due to his ongoing harassment of the Bowden family. However, the police are unable to find any evidence of a crime. As the harassment continues, Bowden is pushed to the edge and hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. After several incidents, Bowden confronts Cady and warns him to leave his family alone or face consequences. Unbeknownst to Bowden, Cady secretly records this conversation using a hidden device. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat, along with an exaggerated display of his own injuries from an earlier altercation, to file a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), then files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, seeking to have Bowden disbarred. In this situation, Max Cady files the restraining order against Sam Bowden to further complicate the situation and make it difficult for Bowden to act against him. This restraining order is a strategic move by Cady in his ongoing torment of the Bowden family, effectively turning the legal system against the very person who once defended him in court."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: I love this hairdryer Product review: This is a great dryer.

It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it. In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\" When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw. So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October.

Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again. Question: suppose the heat source is less efficient happens, how will it affect LESS igneous rock forming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"B: Less A less efficient heat source will have a significant impact on the formation of igneous rocks. To understand why, let's delve deeper into the different stages of the rock cycle and the role that heat plays in these processes. First, it's essential to know that the rock cycle is a series of processes by which rocks are formed, broken down, and transformed into other types of rocks. The three main types of rocks are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock material) cools and solidifies. This cooling may occur either beneath the Earth's surface, forming intrusive igneous rocks, or on the surface due to volcanic eruptions, forming extrusive igneous rocks. Now, let's consider the scenario where the heat source is less efficient. This means that there is not enough heat to properly melt the rocks or maintain a high enough temperature for the magma to remain in a molten state. The following consequences may arise: 1. Reduced volcanic activity: With less heat, fewer volcanic eruptions may occur, meaning there will be fewer opportunities for the formation of extrusive igneous rocks. If the molten material does not reach the surface, it may not solidify as igneous rock. 2. Slower cooling process: If the heat source is less efficient, the magma may cool more slowly. This can result in a different texture of the resulting igneous rocks, with larger mineral crystals forming due to the prolonged cooling time. However, this could also mean that the formation of new igneous rocks takes longer overall. 3. Lower chance of intrusive igneous rock formation: With insufficient heat, the rock material won't be as molten and pliable, reducing the likelihood of forming intrusive igneous rock structures like plutons or batholiths. 4. Increased sedimentation: As less igneous rock is formed, there may be an increase in sedimentary rock formation. This is because the broken-down particles from preexisting rocks, which would typically be recycled into new igneous rocks, may accumulate as sediments and eventually transform into sedimentary rocks. To sum up, a less efficient heat source will likely lead to less igneous rock formation due to reduced volcanic activity, slower cooling processes, and a lower chance of both intrusive and extrusive igneous rock formation. Consequently, there may be an increase in the formation of sedimentary rocks as the particles from weathered rocks accumulate as sediments. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is option B: less igneous rock formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the nickname of the person who meets Violet Worthing at training camp? ? On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter. Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye.

Process: - A tree produces seeds - The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc - The seeds reach the ground - Grow into new trees - These new trees produce seeds - The process repeats itself over and over - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose no trees are cut down happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If no trees are cut down, it is presumed that the natural process of forest formation will continue undisturbed. This perturbation hypothesis will have several direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation, potentially leading to an increased rate of forest growth, resulting in more forests being formed over time. Here are some of the key effects: 1. Increased seed production and dispersion: When trees are allowed to grow and mature fully, they can produce more seeds. This increase in seed production will, in turn, result in a greater number of seeds being dispersed by wind, animals, and water over a larger area. As a consequence, there will be a greater chance for new trees to establish themselves and grow into mature trees, expanding the forested area. 2. Enhanced habitat and biodiversity: Allowing trees to mature and develop naturally will support a diverse ecosystem of plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. This increased biodiversity can contribute to healthy soil development, nutrient cycling, and natural pest control, all of which are essential for a thriving forest ecosystem. Over time, this will create a more resilient and self-sustaining forest, facilitating the formation of more forests in the long run. 3. Improved carbon sequestration: Mature trees are more effective at storing carbon in their trunks, branches, and roots than younger trees. By not cutting down trees, forests will be allowed to sequester more carbon from the atmosphere and help mitigate climate change. This can lead to a more stable climate, which is beneficial for the growth and development of forests. 4. Enhanced soil conditions: Mature trees contribute to better soil formation and stability through their extensive root systems, leaf litter, and the decay of dead wood. These factors allow for better soil retention, structure, and nutrient cycling, which provide suitable conditions for seed germination and seedling establishment. Therefore, by not cutting down trees, the soil conditions for new forest formation will be better maintained. 5. Natural disturbances: As part of the natural forest dynamics, disturbances such as fire, storms, or pest outbreaks will still occur, even if trees are not cut down by humans. These disturbances can create gaps in the forest canopy, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and providing space for new trees to grow. Hence, even without human intervention, forests will still experience some level of disturbance that promotes forest growth and expansion. In summary, if no trees are cut down, the natural process of forest formation and expansion is expected to increase, providing more chances for seed production, dispersion, and establishment. This would likely lead to an indirect increase in forest formation over time. Additionally, better habitat, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and soil conditions will be maintained, further supporting the growing forests and mitigating the impacts of climate change."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Given the following context: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in... answer the following question: What is the name of the person who wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre?

Nobody behind the counter or taking food out looked at me, or acknowledged me. So, I decided I must be doing it wrong. I walked up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that \\"no, we wait on you\\" but he nicely took my order (sandwich and coke), and let me pay (BTW, I included a 20% tip up front, when I paid with my card, so I was trying to be proactive about getting good service...lesson learned) and said they would bring things out.

In Tanzania, it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist. While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.[citation needed] If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where can safari hunters go which are uninviting to the less hardcore ecotourist?","completion":"Safari hunters can visit various destinations that may be uninviting or less appealing to the less hardcore ecotourist. These locations usually involve challenging terrains, extreme weather conditions, and limited amenities or infrastructure. Here are a few examples of such places: 1. Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania: Selous Game Reserve is one of Africa's largest protected wildlife areas and offers the opportunity for adventurous hunters to experience the thrill of hunting big game. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including elephants, lions, buffalo, and leopards. The terrain is rugged, and accommodations are more basic compared to luxury lodges or hotels. 2. Niassa Reserve, Mozambique: Niassa Reserve, located in northern Mozambique, is a relatively remote and lesser-known destination for safari hunting. It is rich in wildlife, including sable antelope, elephant, lion, and buffalo. Its remoteness and lack of infrastructure make it unattractive for the average ecotourist. 3. Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic: This national park offers a remote, wild environment for safari hunters to explore. It is home to elephants, bongos, forest buffalos, and primates, all thriving in dense, tropical forests. Due to its challenging accessibility and distance from main tourist hubs, it is not a popular destination for the casual ecotourist. 4. Kalahari Desert, Botswana and South Africa: The vast, arid landscapes of the Kalahari Desert present a challenging environment for safari hunting. The harsh climate and limited water sources make it a less popular destination for more mainstream ecotourists. However, the desert is home to unique species like the gemsbok, springbok, and the elusive black-maned Kalahari lion, making it an intriguing destination for more hardcore safari hunters. 5. Omo Valley, Ethiopia: Another remote safari hunting destination, the Omo Valley is an ethnically and ecologically diverse region of Ethiopia. It hosts a variety of wildlife species, some of which are endemic to the area. Its extreme remoteness and limited amenities make it less appealing to casual ecotourists, but it offers memorable hunting experiences to those who venture there. These locations are just a few examples of where safari hunters can go to enjoy a more challenging and remote experience, away from the more popular ecotourism destinations. However, it is important to remember that hunting regulations and conservation practices must be strictly followed in these areas to ensure sustainable wildlife management and protect the local ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Where did the coat of arms proper and a lozenge granted to women not develoupe? A: Usually men inherited the coat of arms from their fathers. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"To provide a proper answer to the question, let me first clarify the topic and then present an appropriate response step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking about the circumstances or location where a coat of arms with a lozenge was not granted to women. Step 2: Provide historical context The coat of arms is a tradition that dates back to medieval Europe, where they were used to distinguish different families, clans, and individuals on the battlefield. These symbols were usually passed down from father to son and could be modified slightly to represent individual members of the family. Step 3: Explain the role of women in inheritance of coat of arms In general, women were not granted a coat of arms of their own. However, they could inherit their father's coat of arms if they had no brothers, or they could use their husband's coat of arms after marriage. In such cases, the coat of arms would be displayed on a lozenge-shaped shield, rather than the traditional male shield shape. Step 4: Identify locations or circumstances where this did not develop It is challenging to pinpoint an exact location or circumstances where the tradition of a coat arms with a lozenge for women did not develop. The reason for this is that the granting and inheritance of coats of arms varied significantly among families, regions, and time periods. However, regions where heraldry was less common or not practiced at all, such as certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, would typically lack the tradition of granting coat of arms with a lozenge to women.

First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939, and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics. Starting with his publication of \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence. - Psychopathology is the scientific study of mental disorders, including efforts to understand their genetic, biological, psychological, and social causes; effective classification schemes (nosology); course across all stages of development; manifestations; and treatment. The term may also refer to the manifestation of behaviors that indicate the presence of a mental disorder. - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939. - Aphrodite (; Greek: (\\"Afrodíti\\")) is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. She is identified with the planet Venus, and her Roman equivalent is the goddess . - In classical mythology, Cupid (Latin Cupido, meaning \\"desire\\") is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars, and is known in Latin also as \\"Amor\\" (\\"Love\\"). His Greek counterpart is Eros. - Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - The University of Vienna is a public university located in Vienna, Austria. It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world. With its long and rich history, the University of Vienna has developed into one of the biggest universities in Europe, and also one of the most renowned, especially in the Humanities. It is associated with 15 Nobel prize winners and has been the academic home of a large number of figures both of historical and academic importance. - Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind, which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. - In Greek mythology, Thanatos ([] \\"Death\\", from \\"thnsk\\" \\"to die, be dying\\") was the personification of death. He was a minor figure in Greek mythology, often referred to, but rarely appearing in person. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( German : Jenseits des Lustprinzips ) is a 1920 essay by Sigmund Freud that marks a major turning point in his theoretical approach . Previously , Freud attributed most human behavior to the sexual instinct ( Eros or libido ) . With this essay , Freud went \`\` beyond '' the simple pleasure principle , developing his theory of drives with the addition of the death drive ( s ) ( Todestrieb ( e ) ) ( often referred to as \`\` Thanatos '' ) . - Hypersexuality is a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare researchers and providers to describe extremely frequent or suddenly increased sexual urges or sexual activity. The terms nymphomania and satyriasis were once used to describe the condition, in women and men respectively, but are no longer in general medical use, although the former is still used colloquially. - Moravia is a historical country in the Czech Republic (forming its eastern part) and one of the historical Czech lands, together with Bohemia and Czech Silesia. The medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (from 1348 to 1918), an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire (1004 to 1806), later a crown land of the Austrian Empire (1804 to 1867) and briefly also one of 17 former crown lands of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 to 1918. During the early 20th century, Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1928; it was then merged with Czech Silesia, and eventually dissolved by abolition of the land system in 1949. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - In Greek mythology, Eros (or , \\"Desire\\") was the Greek god of love. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\\"desire\\"). Some myths make him a primordial god, while in other myths, he is the son of Aphrodite. He was one of the winged love gods, Erotes. - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs. - In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive is the drive towards death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\\" (\\"\\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\\"\\") which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\\" This concept has been translated as, \\"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\\". In \\"Pleasure Principle\\", Freud used the plural \\"death drives\\" (\\"Todestriebe\\") much more frequently than in the singular. - Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole-body autopsies. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. It should not be confused with neuropathy, which refers to disorders of the nerves themselves (usually in the peripheral nervous system). - Libido, colloquially known as sex drive, is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, like personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., puberty). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality. - Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus. 'beyond the pleasure principle' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?

The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean.

Read this: When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing. The ZIF insertion used by Nintendo was set to emulate what device? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The ZIF insertion used by Nintendo was set to emulate a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style. Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. This angered the government, and led to his transfer from the capital (1820). He went to the Caucasus and to the Crimea, then to Kamenka and Chisinau, where he became a Freemason. Question: \\"What were main events in Pushkin's early years of writing poetry?

We also glimpse into Kiri's own dark side as Detective Martin discovers that Kiri was involved in multiple shady deals to secure her rise to fame. In the climax of the story, detective Martin follows a lead that points to the relevance between Kiri's shooting and a conspiracy revealing a major scandal that could take down multiple powerful figures in the entertainment industry.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings attracted a favourable review in the press for the first time at the 1817 Summer Exhibition? is inside the article: Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his..., can you guess it ?

The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff.

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. leaves his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, as the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares to advance his nomination. (AP... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on developments in Congress (all times local): 1:20 p.m. A Senate panel has voted favorably for the nomination of former wrestling entertainment executive Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. The 18-1 vote from the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee moves McMahon's nomination to the full Senate for consideration. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has cast the lone \\"no\\" vote. McMahon is the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment. She ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut but has remained active in politics as a donor to Republican candidates and causes. The Small Business Administration helps people get training and financing to start or expand their company. McMahon says she'll make it a priority to review the agency's disaster assistance programs. McMahon has emphasized her business roots helping to getting the wrestling business up and running and eventually employing more than 800 people. __ 1:15 p.m. The Senate has confirmed Elaine Chao to serve as Transportation secretary in the Trump administration. The vote was 93-6 on Tuesday. Chao is an experienced Washington hand. She was labor secretary under President George W. Bush, and is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell voted present. Chao would be a lead actor in pursuing Trump's promise to invest 1 trillion to improve highways, rail service and other infrastructure projects. __ 12:05 p.m. A Senate committee has approved Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos for education secretary, even as two GOP senators expressed some reservations. After a heated debate Tuesday morning, senators on the Health, Education, Pensions and Labor Committee have voted 12-11 along partisan lines to support DeVos' nomination, sending it to the full Senate for action. But two prominent Republicans on the committee, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are expressing their skepticism over DeVos. They say they are not yet sure whether they will vote for her on the Senate floor. Murkowski says DeVos has yet to prove that she deeply cares about America's struggling schools and its children. Murkowski says the nominee has not yet earned her full support. ___ 11:20 a.m. The AFL-CIO is urging the Senate to reject President Trump's pick for to lead the Labor Department. Federation President Richard L. Trumka said in a letter to senators Tuesday that Andrew Puzder's nomination \\"betrays the promise (Trump) made to put working people first.\\" He added that Puzder's record as CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc., could risk government protections on overtime and worker safety. He noted that Puzder is opposed to a big hike in the minimum wage and could \\"torpedo\\" pay rules on certain federal contracts. Puzder has said that \\"the right government policies can\\" produce more jobs and better wages. His confirmation hearing is expected Feb. 7. Democrats have widely panned Puzder's nomination in similar terms. But Republicans control the Senate and there's no sign Puzder's confirmation is imperiled. ___ 11:10 a.m. Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state says she is disturbed that President Donald Trump has removed the energy secretary from a permanent positon on the National Security Council. Trump removed the energy chief as part of a shake-up that also ousted the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence. Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate energy panel, said the energy secretary has a key role in safeguarding the nation's nuclear stockpile. Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist, played a crucial role in developing the 2015 agreement aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Cantwell said \\"now is not the time to remove the energy secretary\\" from the national security post, noting that the Iran deal is \\"based so much on science.\\" __ 11 a.m. Republican and Democratic senators are clashing over the nomination of charter school activist and wealthy Republican donor Betsy DeVos as education secretary. As the Senate Health, Education, Pensions and Labor Committee prepares to vote Tuesday on DeVos' nomination, Chairman Lamar Alexander is lamenting Democrats' fierce opposition to President Donald Trump's pick. He says he respects his colleagues and doesn't question their motives or votes but thinks \\"their concerns are misplaced.\\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington State, the top Democrat on the committee said it was clear that DeVos is \\"the wrong choice.\\" Murray charged that DeVos has spent her family's wealth to push \\"extreme anti-student ideology\\" siphoning money away from public schools \\"toward taxpayer funded private school vouchers, with little accountability, for just a few.\\" __ 10:44 a.m. Senate Finance Committee votes to confirm President Donald Trump's picks for health and Treasury secretary are being indefinitely postponed after Democrats boycotted the meeting. Democratic senators held an abruptly called briefing for reporters outside the hearing room. They said they were demanding more information about the two nominees, GOP Georgia Rep. Tom Price to be Health secretary and financier Steve Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department. The Democrats cited separate newspaper reports about Price's trading in a health company stock and Mnuchin's behavior involving foreclosures when he was a banker. Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said he planned to reschedule the votes but did not say when. He said Democrats \\"ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots.\\" __ 10:35 a.m. The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says she'll vote against President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California says she can't reconcile the independence required in the job \\"with the partisanship this nominee has exhibited.\\" Sessions was one of Trump's earliest supporters. The Senate Judiciary Committee is meeting Tuesday to vote on the nomination. Feinstein also praised Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by Trump Monday after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban. \\"That statement took a steel spine to stand up and say no,\\" Feinstein said. \\"That is what an attorney general must be willing and able to do.\\" Feinstein said she has \\"no confidence\\" Sessions would do that. __ 10:20 a.m. Attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions says he had no role in helping the White House draft an executive order on refugees and immigration. In responses to Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy about his involvement in writing executive orders, Sessions wrote: \\"None. Neither I, nor any of my current staff, had such a role.\\" Leahy asked the question Jan. 25 in reference to orders involving immigration. Sessions returned the written answers Monday. The Judiciary panel is meeting to vote on Sessions' nomination. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley defended the Alabama senator, who has been one of President Donald Trump's strongest supporters. \\"It's not clear to me why it would be a problem even if he had been involved,\\" Grassley said. __ 10 a.m. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has backed Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke for Interior secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry for Energy secretary. President Donald Trump's nominees met little resistance in the panel Tuesday morning. The committee voted 16-6 for Zinke and 16-7 for Perry. The nominations now go to the full Senate. ||||| Elaine Chao moves forward despite a brief round of uncertainty about whether she would get caught up in Democrats' protest of Trump's executive orders. | AP Photo Senate endorses Elaine Chao for Transportation Department The Senate Tuesday handily approved Elaine Chao to be the next secretary of Transportation, despite a handful of Democratic no votes amid unrest about President Donald Trump’s executive orders. What would likely have been a unanimous vote in her favor before President Trump’s controversial travel ban ended up with six Democrats voting against her: Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.) — and, most notably, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.). Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — Chao’s spouse — voted “present.” Story Continued Below On Monday, Schumer had tweeted that he would vote no on “everybody” — “DeVos - No Tillerson - No Sessions - No Mulvaney - No Price - No Mnuchin - No Pruitt - No Puzder – No.” Chao wasn’t named specifically. He also tweeted that day, “I'll vote NO on noms who'll be the very worst of the anti-immigrant, anti-middle class, billionaires’ club cabinet.” He hadn’t indicated that Chao was among those. None of the senators’ offices immediately responded to requests for comment on their no vote, but they are likely protest votes about things other than Chao or her qualifications. Other Democrats gave her a full-throated endorsement. Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he’s “pleased that, unlike many of the individuals that President Trump has nominated to the highest posts in government, Secretary Chao takes this position with a background in transportation issues and previous experience running a federal agency.” He noted his hope that Chao would be able to get bipartisan consensus in Congress to “develop a responsible infrastructure bill” that provides “real funding” to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. Indeed, Chao now inherits the responsibility of putting meat on the bones of Trump’s infrastructure plan, sold during his campaign as a trillion-dollar investment in the nation’s roads, bridges, airports, electric grid, schools and broadband. But GOP leaders in Congress have appeared less eager to endorse a big-spending infrastructure proposal, and have not prioritized Trump’s vision amid a host of other items such as health care. There are also questions about just how much direct federal spending may be included in Trump’s infrastructure plan, which would be key to attracting Democrats. What few details the administration has provided so far appear to describe a plan relying mostly on tax incentives and private-sector capital. Chao said at her confirmation hearing that the infrastructure plan would likely include some direct spending, but the amount will be a subject of much debate. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, noted Tuesday that Trump hadn’t consulted with Chao before implementing his travel ban, which caused chaos at airports around the world. Regardless, he voted in favor of her nomination. “We need Secretary Chao as someone who has the experience and has common sense and would be in the position to offer level-headed, good experience-based advice to the government going forward,” Nelson said on the Senate floor. Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said before the vote that “it would be hard to come up with a more qualified nominee” for the position at the helm of DOT than Chao, who has already served as the department’s deputy secretary, as well as secretary of Labor. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In recent developments in the US Congress, a Senate panel voted 18-1 favorably for the nomination of former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as head of the Small Business Administration.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly...

Bill Richardson offered on Friday to broker talks between Cubans and Cuban Americans to set the stage for normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba as he ended a five-day visit to the communist-led island. SANTA FE, New Mexico | SANTA FE, New Mexico (Reuters) - Billy the Kid, the Wild West outlaw who is reputed to have killed 21 men and whose exploits have been widely chronicled in U.S. popular culture, is under consideration for a pardon. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said on Thursday he was reviewing a pardon petition based on the widespread belief that New Mexico territorial Governor Lew Wallace promised the 19th century gunman a pardon in exchange for his testimony in a murder trial. \\"As someone who is fascinated with New Mexico's rich history, I've always been intrigued by the story of Billy the Kid and, in particular, the alleged promise of a pardon he was given,\\" Richardson said in a statement. \\"I will diligently review this new petition and all the facts available regarding an agreement between Billy the Kid and Governor Wallace before rendering any decision,\\" Richardson said, adding he would decide by the end of the year. The two-term Democratic governor, who leaves office at the end of the month, asked historians and others to weigh in with their opinions on a website dedicated to the issue, here Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett shot Billy the Kid to death at point-blank range in 1881. Newspapers had already turned the young outlaw, whose real name was Henry McCarty, into a larger-than-life figure by the time of his death in his early 20s. A book by Garrett transformed McCarty into a legendary figure of America's western frontier. He has since become the subject of many songs, films and books. Richardson received various pardon requests over the years from McCarty's descendants, but this was the first formal petition he received in the matter. It was presented by trial attorney and western history buff Randi McGinn, who was designated to study the documents of that era to determine whether there was sufficient basis for a pardon to be seriously considered. The petition she submitted on Tuesday \\"is narrow in scope and does not argue for a blanket pardon of all of Billy the Kid's activities,\\" a statement from Richardson's office said.

Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.

Article: We Chat, the Chinese social media smartphone app, saw an increase in user numbers of 41 per cent year on year to 500m at the end of 2014, in a sign that parent company Tencent is extending its reach for the mobile internet. Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \\"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly. After a BMW ad was introduced on some users' feeds in January, many users complained of \\"discrimination\\" by Tencent's data mining algorithm. They said it unfairly considered them as not wealthy or successful enough to view the sought-after BMW ad. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Answer:","completion":"From the passage, we can learn that WeChat, a Chinese social media smartphone app, experienced a significant increase in user numbers (41% year on year) to reach 500 million by the end of 2014.

The company's revenue grew by 24% to ¥20.98 billion, mainly driven by online gaming revenues. Although the specific contribution of WeChat to Tencent's revenues is not clear, the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it adapts its business to be more mobile-centric.

However, the passage notes that this number is higher than the total number of internet users in China (640 million), according to government data. Tencent has been cautious about monetizing WeChat through advertising to avoid hindering user base growth, but analysts predict that it will eventually introduce ads.

Federico Fellini, Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI (Italian: [fede'ri:ko fel'li:ni]; 20 January 1920 - 31 October 1993) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. Known for his distinct style that blends fantasy and baroque images with earthiness, he is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. His films have ranked, in polls such as Cahiers du cinema and Sight & Sound, as some of the greatest films of all time. Sight & Sound lists his 1963 film 8 1/2 as the 10th-greatest film of all time. Retained on business in Rimini, Urbano sent wife and family to Rome in 1940 to share an apartment with his son. Fellini and Ruggero Maccari, also on the staff of Marc'Aurelio, began writing radio sketches and gags for films. Not yet twenty and with Fabrizi's help, Fellini obtained his first screen credit as a comedy writer on Mario Mattoli's Il pirata sono io (The Pirate's Dream). Progressing rapidly to numerous collaborations on films at Cinecitta, his circle of professional acquaintances widened to include novelist Vitaliano Brancati and scriptwriter Piero Tellini. In the wake of Mussolini's declaration of war against France and England on 10 June 1940, Fellini discovered Kafka's The Metamorphosis, Gogol, John Steinbeck and William Faulkner along with French films by Marcel Carne, Rene Clair, and Julien Duvivier. In 1941 he published Il mio amico Pasqualino, a 74-page booklet in ten chapters describing the absurd adventures of Pasqualino, an alter ego. Writing for radio while attempting to avoid the draft, Fellini met his future wife Giulietta Masina in a studio office at the Italian public radio broadcaster EIAR in the autumn of 1942. Well-paid as the voice of Pallina in Fellini's radio serial, Cico and Pallina, Masina was also well known for her musical-comedy broadcasts which cheered an audience depressed by the war. In November 1942, Fellini was sent to Libya, occupied by Fascist Italy, to work on the screenplay of I cavalieri del deserto (Knights of the Desert, 1942), directed by Osvaldo Valenti and Gino Talamo. Fellini welcomed the assignment as it allowed him \\"to secure another extension on his draft order\\". Responsible for emergency re-writing, he also directed the film's first scenes. When Tripoli fell under siege by British forces, he and his colleagues made a narrow escape by boarding a German military plane flying to Sicily. His African adventure, later published in Marc'Aurelio as \\"The First Flight\\", marked \\"the emergence of a new Fellini, no longer just a screenwriter, working and sketching at his desk, but a filmmaker out in the field\\". The apolitical Fellini was finally freed of the draft when an Allied air raid over Bologna destroyed his medical records. Fellini and Giulietta hid in her aunt's apartment until Mussolini's fall on 25 July 1943. After dating for nine months, the couple were married on 30 October 1943. Several months later, Masina fell down the stairs and suffered a miscarriage. She gave birth to a son, Pierfederico, on 22 March 1945, but the child died of encephalitis a month later on 24 April 1945. The tragedy had enduring emotional and artistic repercussions.

Article: Elizabeth Freeman was born about 1742 to African American parents who were slaves. At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years. She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal.\\" Question: What did Mumbet learn from discussions about the new consititution? Options: A: She should always obey her owners' orders B: She should be as free and equal as whites C: How to be a good servant D: How to apply for a job A:","completion":"Mumbet learned from discussions about the new constitution that she should be as free and equal as whites."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas.

John McCain (R-Arizona) said yesterday that he will introduce legislation for mandatory drug testing of athletes if major league baseball players and owners do","completion":"not agree on a plan to eliminate steroid use in their sport. The announcement comes in the wake of an ongoing investigation and several high-profile doping scandals involving prominent athletes. This situation has raised concerns about the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in sports and has led to policymakers and sports officials calling for stricter regulations on drugs in sports. The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports has a long and complex history. While there is evidence that stimulants and other substances have been used by athletes since ancient times, the modern era of doping began in the early 20th century, when anabolic steroids were first developed. As these and other substances became more readily available and their effects on athletic performance became more widely recognized, their use became more prevalent, often leading to a competitive arms race between those who sought to use PEDs and those who sought to detect and penalize their use. This history of doping in sports has led to considerable controversy. On one hand, some argue that the use of PEDs is a legitimate and predictable response to the intense pressures and expectations faced by professional athletes, and that seeking an advantage through any means necessary is simply part of the competitive process. Others counter that the use of PEDs undermines the fundamental values of sportsmanship, fair competition, and the pursuit of excellence through hard work and dedication. Additionally, there are concerns about the health risks associated with the use of PEDs, which can include heart problems, liver damage, and increased risk of strokes, among other issues. The proposal by Sen. John McCain to introduce legislation for mandatory drug testing of athletes is an attempt to address these concerns and combat the use of PEDs in sports. This approach has several potential benefits. First, mandatory testing would level the playing field by identifying and removing athletes who are using PEDs, thereby increasing the likelihood that the outcome of competitions would be determined by talent and hard work rather than by who has access to the best doping agents. Second, mandatory testing could serve as a deterrent to athletes who may be tempted to use PEDs, as they would face the consequence of being caught and facing significant penalties, including the loss of endorsements, suspensions, and damage to their reputations. Third, widespread drug testing could raise public awareness of the issue of doping in sports, leading to greater scrutiny of the issue and more pressure on athletes and sports organizations to promote clean competition. However, mandatory drug testing for athletes also faces several challenges. First, the issue of privacy and the scope of drug testing could pose legal challenges, as athletes and player associations may argue that mandatory drug testing constitutes an invasion of their privacy rights. Moreover, there are concerns about the potential for false-positive test results, which could unfairly jeopardize the careers of innocent athletes. Second, the development and implementation of a comprehensive drug testing program can be costly, as it requires specialized labs, equipment, and personnel to carry out the tests and analyze the results. Critics argue that these resources could be better spent on other initiatives aimed at promoting clean sports, such as education, training, and support for athletes. In addition, the effectiveness of mandatory drug testing as a deterrent to doping is debated. Some critics argue that determined dopers will simply find new ways to avoid detection, and that these efforts may ultimately result in a more sophisticated and dangerous doping landscape. As a result, these critics question whether mandatory testing actually creates a level playing field or simply encourages the development of new, more advanced doping agents and methods to avoid detection. In conclusion, the proposal by Sen. John McCain to introduce legislation for mandatory drug testing of athletes is an important step in the ongoing debate over the role of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. While the benefits of mandatory testing, such as leveling the playing field and acting as a deterrent to doping, are significant, there are also considerable challenges that need to be addressed, including the cost of implementing such tests and concerns about privacy and the potential for false-positive results. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any anti-doping measure will depend on the dedication and commitment of athletes, sports organizations, policymakers, and the public to the principle of clean and fair competition in sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During this process, glucose molecules are combined with oxygen, which eventually leads to the creation of water, ATP, and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide produced is a waste product and is released from the organism back into the atmosphere through breathing or other processes (for example, through plant stomata during the day).

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds.

The answer is:","completion":"This information is about Donald Dinnie, a Scottish Highland Games strongman who was born in 1837 in Birse, Scotland. Donald Dinnie was one of the most renowned strongmen and athletes of the 19th century, and his accomplishments were widely recognized within the world of Highland Games and beyond. Dinnie's weight of 210 lbs (95 kg) and height of 6'1\\" (185 cm) were well-suited for the physically demanding activities associated with the Highland Games, which typically included events such as the hammer throw, caber toss, and the stone put. In his career, Donald Dinnie participated in more than 11,000 competitions, winning over 10,000 of these. His exceptional skill and prowess across a range of events earned him a revered status among contemporaries and later generations. Born as Donald Dinnie in 1837 in a small rural parish in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, he grew up in a family with strong connections to the traditional Highland Games. His father, David Dinnie, was a well-known competitor, and his brother, Robert, also participated in Highland Games competitions throughout Scotland. As a result, it was natural for Donald to develop a profound interest and talent in these sports from an early age. Throughout his career, Dinnie traveled extensively to compete in various events, both in the UK and abroad, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. His success led to numerous invitations to perform as a professional athlete, and he represented Scotland in international competitions. One of the most famous challenges associated with Donald Dinnie is the \\"Dinnie Stones,\\" which are two massive stones with a combined weight of over 730 lbs (330 kg) that he reportedly carried across the Potarch Bridge in Aberdeenshire in 1860. In addition to his achievements as a strongman, Dinnie was also an accomplished businessman, running a successful gymnasium and providing training and coaching services to fellow athletes. However, his name will forever be synonymous with the Highland Games, where he left a lasting legacy. Sadly, Donald Dinnie passed away in 1916 at the age of 79. However, his impact on the Highland Games and Scottish sports, in general, remains to this day. Throughout his remarkable career, achievements, and enduring legacy, Donald Dinnie remains a symbol of strength and fortitude for generations of athletes inspired by his example."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain. Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Question: \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\" Response: \\"Al Qaeda\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Step 2: Set up the conflict Zombie Overlord puts a bounty of 5000 for anyone who can bring him Victor Crowley's head. He believes that obtaining Victor Crowley's head will amplify his power and dominance. Step 3: The protagonists' motivation The survivors learn about the bounty on an intercepted radio transmission. Sam, the conspiracy theorist, convinces the group that obtaining Victor Crowley's head might unlock a hidden weakness in Zombie Overlord, as no enemy rewards such a high bounty without reasons. The group decides to hunt Victor Crowley and use his head to weaken the Zombie forces. Step 4: The journey and challenges The protagonist group travels through treacherous territories infested with zombies and other hostile groups. They gather clues and piece together the history of Victor Crowley's disturbing origins. They overcome various obstacles, strengthen their camaraderie, and save survivors on their way. Step 5: The conflict with Victor Crowley Guided by Sam's research, the group locates the lair of Victor Crowley, known as, \\"The Butcher\\", and enters into a terrifying battle. Facing traps, deadly weapons, and the relentless persistence of a supernatural killer, the group must rely on their wits and skills to survive. Step 6: The downfall of Victor Crowley Despite losing one of their own (Sam), the protagonist group manages to defeat Victor Crowley. Luna, with her medical knowledge, discovers a dormant weakness in Crowley's anatomy, which they exploit to neutralize and defeat him, obtaining his head. Step 7: Final showdown with Zombie Overlord Armed with Victor Crowley's head, the surviving group confronts Zombie Overlord. Jack, the ex-military officer, enacts a plan to utilize the head's potential power against Zombie Overlord. The head reveals a hidden source of Zombie Overlord's power, and Jack disables it, resulting in a loss of control over the zombie hordes. Step 8: Resolution and hope for a better future With Zombie Overlord defeated and the zombies in disarray, the survivors take the opportunity to unite the remaining humans and begin rebuilding society. Though the future remains uncertain, Jack, Luna, and Sarah find solace in knowing they've given humanity a fighting chance. In summary, \\"5000: The Hunt for Victor Crowley's Bounty\\" revolves around a group of survivors who attempt to hunt down Victor Crowley, and use his head's potential power to defeat Zombie Overlord, who had offered a bounty of 5000 for Crowley's head.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considered himself a true Parisian? , can you please find it? Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion.

Available choices: - less wind - dry soil - coastlines - flooding - rivers - streams - increase in top soil - mulch","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What enhances the effects of erosion?\\" based on the hints provided by your teacher is \\"dry soil.\\" Here's a detailed explanation: Erosion is the process of wearing away rocks, soil, and other natural materials by wind, water, or ice. Several factors can enhance the effects of erosion, and understanding these factors can help us prevent or mitigate the consequences of erosion on the landscape. Your teacher mentioned that being exposed to wind can cause erosion of soil, which is true. Wind erosion is prominent in areas with less vegetation and dry, loose soil. The wind can pick up particles of soil and deposit them elsewhere, which is known as deflation. This process can cause significant loss of topsoil, resulting in decreased soil fertility and potential damage to structures or infrastructure located near the eroding area. Another hint your teacher provided is that wind erosion can remove significant quantities of soil from bare, dry lands. This indicates that the presence of dry soil contributes to the enhanced effects of erosion. In areas with dry soil, there is typically less cohesion among soil particles, making it easier for the wind to displace them. Additionally, dry soil is more susceptible to compaction and crusting, which can further increase the vulnerability of the soil to wind erosion. While some of the other answer choices do contribute to erosion (such as coastlines, flooding, rivers, and streams), the hints provided specifically point to the effects of wind erosion on dry soil. Therefore, the best answer in this case is \\"dry soil,\\" as it aligns with the information provided by your teacher and highlights one of the key factors that enhance the effects of erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, let's say your friend wants to give you some of his cookies. He has 18 cookies and 54 cookies which he wants to combine and give you. So, first, we need to add his 18 cookies and 54 cookies together: 18 + 54 = 72 cookies Now, the math problem looks like this: -60 * p - 132 = 72 * p Next, let's see how many total cookies your friend will have after combined. To do that, we will add the number of cookies your friend has (72 * p) to the number of cookies you have (-60 * p). First, set them up with the same sign: -60 * p - 132 = 72 * p -60 * p + (-132) = 72 * p Now, let's add your friend's cookies to yours: -60 * p + (-132) - 72 * p = 0 Add both amounts together: -132 * p = -132 Now, let's pretend you guys made a deal that if you solve this problem, you'll get the same number of cookies as your friend. To find out how many cookies each person gets, we'll divide the -132 cookies by -132: -132 * p / -132 = -132 / -132 p = 1 So, the solution is p = 1.

Q: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

According to the above context, answer the following question. Why does Boch say it's a bad idea for Trump to pursue a pardon? A:","completion":"Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University, believes it's a bad idea for Trump to pursue a pardon for several reasons. Firstly, no president has ever tried to pardon themselves, and it would be an unprecedented move, testing the constitutional boundaries. Secondly, Bloch thinks it is unlikely that a court would allow the president to pardon himself. If Trump were to attempt to give himself a pardon, it might lead to impeachment by most congresses due to the controversial nature of the action. Finally, Bloch notes that when most people accept a pardon, it is often seen as an admission of guilt. Thus, if Trump were to pursue a pardon, it could be interpreted as accepting his guilt, which could be detrimental to his reputation and standing as the president."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER II SOMETHING OF THE PAST \\"The horses are running away!\\" \\"Oh, we'll be killed!\\" Such were the cries from the two girls as the mettlesome grays tore along the country highway at a speed that seemed marvelous. \\"Dave, can I help you?\\" asked Ben, anxiously. \\"I don't think so,\\" answered the young driver between his set teeth. \\"I guess I can bring them down. Anyway, I can try.\\" \\"What shall we do?\\" wailed Jessie. \\"Don't do anything--sit still,\\" ordered Dave. He was afraid that Jessie in her excitement might fling herself from the flying sleigh. On and on bounded the frightened team. Each of the grays now had his bit in his teeth, and it looked as if it would be impossible for Dave to obtain control of the pair. And, worst of all, they were now approaching a turn, with the hill on one side of the roadway and a gully on the other. \\"Better keep them as far as possible away from the gully,\\" suggested Ben. \\"That is what I'm trying to do,\\" returned Dave, setting his teeth grimly.

Question: Background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Paragraph: The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues.

Question: As we cease working to develop things our technology levels as a species decreases or increases? Text: The development of better missiles fostered better rocket technologies.","completion":"Analyzing the given text, it is evident that the development of better missiles has led to improved rocket technologies. This can be further understood in the context of technological advancements as a whole. As we cease working to develop new technologies or improve existing ones, the overall level of technology available to our species may either stagnate or decline. This can be attributed to multiple factors. Firstly, innovation is an essential aspect of any species' advancement. By constantly exploring new ways to address problems, improve existing solutions, and enhance efficiency through technology, we can achieve outstanding results that allow for greater convenience, improved understanding of the world, and progress in various fields. Thus, when we stop working on developing things, we prevent ourselves from being exposed to new ideas or opportunities for innovation, which could inevitably hinder our technological progress as a species. Furthermore, when the pace of technological development slows down, it could potentially lead to a reduction in investment and support for research and development activities. Governments, corporations, and institutions might redirect their resources to other areas if technological development isn't seen as a priority. This could have a cascading effect on the financial support mechanisms that usually fund the research and development of new technologies. Moreover, the collaborative nature of technological advancement also plays a part in determining our progress as a species. Often, breakthroughs in one field can have implications for other areas, spurring on further advancements. By halting the development of new technologies in one area, we could inadvertently slow down advancements in other fields. Taking the given text into consideration, the development of better missiles fostered better rocket technologies, which likely encompassed advancements in materials science, propulsion systems, guidance, and navigation, among others. This technological progress in rocketry could have broad implications for various industries, including space exploration, telecommunications, and military applications. In conclusion, if we cease working to develop things, there is a possibility of experiencing a stagnation—if not an outright decline—in our technological advancements as a species. For this reason, it is crucial for our progress that we continue to innovate, collaborate, and seek better solutions to create a future filled with technological marvels and enhanced capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. and a hint : In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Please answer this question : Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions?

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise and the hypothesis are related, but does not necessarily entail one another directly. The entailment deals with the logical connection between the statements and the conclusion that can be drawn when one statement is true or false. Firstly, let us break down the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Oh! I said, rather nonplussed.\\" The premise here indicates that the speaker expressed their reaction (saying \\"Oh!\\") to something while feeling nonplussed. The term \\"nonplussed\\" means to be surprised, confused, or unsure about how to react to a particular situation. Hypothesis: \\"I wasn't sure what to think.\\" The hypothesis here suggests that the speaker was uncertain about their thoughts or feelings about a situation, which can align with the feeling of being nonplussed. Now, let's consider the relationship between the two statements: 1. Does the premise imply that the hypothesis must be true? If someone is nonplussed, it generally implies they are puzzled, confused, or unsure about what to think or feel in response to a situation. In this sense, there is an alignment between the premise and the hypothesis. However, being nonplussed does not always explicitly imply not being sure about what to think – it can simply indicate a momentary confusion or surprise. 2. Does the hypothesis imply that the premise must be true? It is not a requirement for someone who is unsure about what to think to be nonplussed. Uncertainty about one's own thoughts can arise from different emotional states or situations, not just those that evoke a feeling of being nonplussed.

Anjem Choudary among nine arrested in London anti-terrorism raid Anjem Choudary, one of the most high profile Islamists in Britain, has been arrested by police for allegedly encouraging terrorism. Choudary, 47, was one of nine men arrested by officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command on Thursday morning. Police gave only sparse details, but the men were arrested on suspicion of being members of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation, as well as encouraging terrorism. Choudary gained publicity for statements over the years which inflamed some people, but which stayed on the right side of the law. He is a former lawyer, self styled preacher and says he is an expert in Islamic or Shariah law. On Thursday morning his phone was uncharacteristically switched off and a chat group he uses to communicate his message through was silent and saying it was last viewed at 5.33am. The men arrested were aged from 22 to 51 years old and were all detained in London. Police said a total of 19 addresses were being searched, mostly in London. Police said community premises were being raided, as well as residential and business addresses. One address is in Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands, eleven in east London, one in west London, one in north-west London and five in south London. Neighbours said Choudhury appeared to move out of his semi-detached home in Walthamstow, north-east London, last week and that there was significant police activity at the address over the weekend. “The police activity was definitely last week,” said one neighbour, who declined to be named. “Police officers came round and went up the doorstep - two were walking around constantly and there were three police cars parked down the road. They were in pairs. A police car came round a few times. Later that evening I saw the light on upstairs after the police had gone.” The neighbour added that Choudhury lived in the house for two or three years but removed some belongings last week. “We’ve had leaflets from rightwing groups put though our door saying do you know he lives down your street,” the neighbour said, adding that they were on “nodding terms” with Choudhury. Another neighbour, Derek Rayner, 70, said Choudhary “kept himself to himself” but was not popular with local residents. “He hasn’t done me any harm personally and he hasn’t done his neighbours any harm but I just don’t want him on my doorstep,” Rayner said. On Thursday morning the property where Choudhary lived was covered in scaffolding, with a number of workers leaving and entering the house. It is unclear whether Choudhary has moved out of the address permanently or until the works, which started several weeks ago, are completed. In a statement the Met said: “These arrests and searches are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist related terrorism and are not in response to any immediate public safety risk.” Those arrested in Thursday’s raids are being held at police stations in the capital. The Met said: “Officers from the Metropolitan police service’s counter-terrorism command have arrested nine men this morning, Thursday, 25 September, on suspicion of being a member of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation contrary to Section 11 and 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and encouraging terrorism contrary to Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Anjem Choudary, a well-known man in Britain who talks about his beliefs in Islam, has been arrested by the police because they think he was encouraging bad actions called terrorism. Terrorism is when people hurt or scare others to make a point about their ideas or beliefs. The police arrested 9 men, including Anjem Choudary, who were between 22 and 51 years old. They also searched many places like homes, businesses, and community areas in London and another city.

Question: Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description. Which of the following about e--bikes is true? A) The cheaper e-bikes are usually made of lighter materials. B) Most e-bikes in the l,000 range are a bicycle, not a motor vehicle.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ronan Farrow, the biological son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, distinguishing him as one of the country's brightest thinkers. But given their estranged relationship, it is unlikely that Woody will be celebrating along with him. Ronan, 23, and Woody, 75, had a very public falling out when Woody began a romantic relationship with Mia's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 years his junior. Young leader: Ronan Farrow has worked as a UNICEF spokesman and as a special appointment in the State Department. 'He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Ronan has not seen much of Woody since his romantic relationship with Soon-Yi began in 1992 when Ronan was only five years old. Earlier bonds: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow walk as Mia carries their son Satchel, who later changed his name to Ronan. Together: Woody and Mia were a couple for 12 years before it ended in 1992 when Farrow found naked pictures of her adopted daughter in Woody's home. Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Mia split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children. Prodigy: Ronan graduated from Bard College at 15 and Yale Law School at 21. During the proceedings, which were closely followed, Mia claimed that Woody had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated. Mia was awarded full custody, and Woody was only allowed to have supervised visits with Ronan, originally named Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow. Woody was denied visits with Dylan, who later changed her name to Malone, and the couple's other adopted child Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Woody at all. In a PBS documentary titled American Masters, Woody is profiled in detail about his work and Soon-Yi is seen in clips. He never mentions Ronan in the entire three-and-a-half hour series, the second portion of which airs tonight. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with Mia. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. The strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back, and he has been deemed a child prodigy. Controversial: Woody and Soon-Yi have been married since 1997 and have two adopted children together. He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009. After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination. This year, 32 Americans have been nominated for the scholarship that will pay for the expenses of a year of study at Oxford University. Family outing: Ronan seen here with his mother and half-brother Fletcher Farrow Previn, was raised by his mother after she won full custody in 1992. For a man known for his many neuroses, Woody Allen hasn't let that stop him from enjoying his love life. The famous New Yorker has been married three times, in addition to a number of multi-year relationships with actresses Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. Ronan is his only biological son, but he has four adopted children- two that he adopted with Mia and two with his current wife Soon-Yi. He first married at age 19 to a 16-year-old girl named Harlene Rosen, and that marriage lasted for five years. Undeterred, Woody married actress Louise Lasser, and though they divorced three years later, she continued to work with him and was featured in three films after they ended their romantic relationship. The recent release of Diane Keaton's autobiography gives a glimpse into their partnership, and while it only lasted a year, their professional one lasted much longer with Ms Keaton serving as his muse for such films as Annie Hall. 'He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful,' Keaton writes in her book. Keaton was not his first relationship that played out on the big screen, as Woody was rumored to have dated a 17-year-old student Stacey Nelkin in the 1970s and she was said to be the inspiration for his 1979 film Manhattan. Woody's relationship with Mia Farrow, which began in 1980, was quite the Hollywood pairing, ending in explosive Hollywood fashion. Mia had previously been married to Frank Sinatra and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in Rosemary's Baby, so she was famous in her own right when she and Woody started their relationship. The couple never married but were together for 12 years. Mia had three biological children and three adopted children from a previous relationship, one of which was Soon-Yi Previn who Mia adopted from Korea at the age of 8 years old. When she and Woody were together, the couple adopted two more children and she gave birth to their son Ronan. In 1982, Mia found naked photos of Soon-Yi, who was 21 at the time, on Woody's mantelpiece. This discovery prompted a torrid legal battle between Mia and Woody over the custody of their children. Woody was denied access to their daughter Dylan, allowed only supervised visits with Ronan, and their eldest son Moses was given the choice- and decided not to see his father. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children with from his relationship with Mia. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. In spite of the drama, Soon-Yi and Woody stayed together, eventually marrying in 1997. The couple have since adopted two children named Bechet and Manzie Tio, their names paying homage to two jazz musicians. 'The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things,' Woody has said. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The Galápagos Islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands 600 miles off the west coast of South America. The islands are famous for their many species found nowhere else. It was on these islands where Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution. Q: The galápagos islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands 600 miles off the west coast of what continent? Choices: - north america - europe - asia - south america A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"South America. Based on the provided paragraph, the Galápagos Islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands situated 600 miles off the west coast of South America. The islands are well-known for their unique species that are not found anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, it is on these islands where the renowned scientist Charles Darwin started to develop his groundbreaking theory of evolution. The Galápagos Islands play a significant role in the understanding of biodiversity, with a wealth of endemic species that have evolved in isolation due to their remote location. This geographical isolation has led to the development of distinct and unique ecosystems, which in turn provided invaluable data and observations for Darwin's research. The Galápagos Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, and apart from their distance from South America, they are also quite far away from the other continents mentioned as choices: - North America: Though still in the Western Hemisphere, North America is separated from the Galápagos by both South America and a large portion of the Pacific Ocean. - Europe: Across the Atlantic Ocean to the east of South America, Europe is thousands of miles away from the Galápagos Islands. - Asia: On the far eastern side of the world relative to the Galápagos, Asia is situated across the massive expanse of the Pacific Ocean. In summary, the Galápagos Islands' location 600 miles off the west coast of South America makes this continent the correct answer among the given choices. These islands are incredibly important for biodiversity study and played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of evolution thanks to Charles Darwin's work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While almost all of them belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight.

Question: \\"What would indicate that everything is okay?\\" Context: \\"If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of the appointment of an in pectore cardinal, the term \\"everything is okay\\" can be understood as a situation wherein the conditions are deemed favorable and safe for the Pope to publicly announce the identity of the in pectore cardinal without jeopardizing the individual's safety, the interests of the Church, or the broader political and social contexts. Various factors may contribute to assessing whether \\"everything is okay,\\" including the following: 1. Personal safety of the in pectore cardinal: One reason for a cardinal to be appointed in pectore is to protect the individual's safety in cases where revealing their identity might put them at risk. If the individual's safety can be reasonably assured, this might indicate that everything is okay for the announcement to be made public. 2. Stability of the local church and community: The Pope may have appointed the in pectore cardinal to protect a vulnerable local church or Christian community. If there is significant improvement in the stability and wellbeing of that community, it may suggest that everything is okay for the cardinal's identity to be revealed. 3. Diplomatic or political factors: Sometimes, the disclosure of an in pectore cardinal's identity may have political or diplomatic ramifications. If tensions have eased between the Holy See and the government, or if the government's attitude towards the Church has become more favorable, it may be an indication that everything is okay for the announcement to be made. 4. Changes in leadership: If there has been a change in leadership, either within the Church or secular authorities, that creates a more favorable environment for the cardinal's appointment, it may be a sign that everything is okay for the Pope to reveal the identity of the in pectore cardinal. 5. The Pope's judgment: Ultimately, the decision to disclose or not to disclose the identity of an in pectore cardinal will be guided by the Pope's judgment of whether it is safe and appropriate to do so. The Pope's assessment of the various factors leading to the appointment of the cardinal will play a crucial role in determining if everything is okay. 6. Support from other ecclesiastical authorities: If other ecclesiastical authorities within the Church, such as members of the Roman Curia or other cardinals, express support and affirmation of the in pectore cardinal's appointment, this may be another signal that everything is okay for the Pope to proceed with the public announcement. In conclusion, determining if \\"everything is okay\\" for revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal is a complex process that depends on several factors, including personal safety of the cardinal, the stability and wellbeing of the local church and community, diplomatic and political considerations, changes in leadership, consultation with ecclesiastical authorities, and ultimately, the Pope's judgment. When these various conditions have been assessed and the Pope deems it safe to make the appointment public, it can be considered that everything is okay for the cardinal's identity to be disclosed and the individual can rank in precedence alongside other cardinals appointed at the time of their in pectore appointment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Decide when you've made a choice to be bored. Article:","completion":"Title: Overcoming Student Boredom: Identifying Root Causes and Implementing Engaging Strategies Introduction Boredom is a common emotion experienced by many students, affecting their ability to focus, engage, and learn in the classroom. A recent study has revealed that around 63% of students feel bored at least once during a school day, emphasizing the need for both educators and students to address this issue. The first step in overcoming boredom is to identify its underlying causes. In this article, we will examine common triggers, discuss when a conscious decision to be bored might be at play, and offer possible solutions for students and educators. Identifying the Types of Boredom 1. Subject-specific boredom: In some cases, boredom might be confined to specific subjects rather than affecting a student's entire academic experience. Perhaps a particular subject lacks personal interest, is perceived as too difficult, or seems disconnected from real-life relevance. 2. Teaching style: A teacher's style plays a significant role in engaging students. For some, a lecture-based approach might not resonate, leading to disinterest and disconnect. In this case, boredom might stem from a lack of suitable teaching methods or the absence of the student's preferred learning style. 3. Environmental factors: Certain environmental factors can impact a student's ability to concentrate, such as overcrowded classrooms, excessive noise, uncomfortable seating, or inadequate lighting. In such cases, boredom might manifest as a consequence of an uncomfortable physical environment. 4. Emotional and psychological factors: If a student feels unsupported, unchallenged, or overwhelmed by personal circumstances, they may become bored academically. Here, emotional and psychological factors create a barrier to engagement and contribute to the experience of boredom. When a Choice to be Bored is Made There are times when students consciously make the choice to be bored. Passive engagement, or the act of choosing not to participate actively in class-related activities, can be a catalyst for boredom. This voluntary detachment is often a coping mechanism used to avoid the pressure of academic performance, peer judgment, or fear of failure. Identifying when a choice to be bored has been made is crucial in combating the issue. Strategies for Overcoming Boredom 1. Evaluate personal interests: Students should evaluate their interests and identify topics of personal significance. Learning to connect academic subjects with real-life relevance, such as hobbies or future career goals, can stimulate curiosity and promote engagement. 2. Communicate with educators: Establishing open communication with teachers can clarify expectations and enable discussions about alternative learning methods. Students can express their preferred learning style or suggest ideas for diverse teaching methods that align with their interests. 3. Address environmental factors: If environmental factors are the root of boredom, schools should consider making necessary adjustments to create an optimal learning environment. Students can also take personal responsibility by selecting better seating arrangements or utilizing aids that decrease distractive stimuli. 4. Confront emotional and psychological barriers: Students should not shy away from addressing emotional or psychological factors impacting their engagement. Speaking with a guidance counselor or mental health professional can be an effective way to develop coping mechanisms and foster a more positive outlook on learning. 5. Self-reflection and self-awareness: Students should regularly evaluate their choices and behaviors in the learning environment. Identifying when boredom is a result of passive engagement will help in making a conscious effort to participate and challenge oneself in the future. Conclusion Addressing boredom in students requires a comprehensive understanding of its root causes and active participation from both students and educators alike. By identifying the underlying triggers, whether they be subject-specific, teaching style related, environmental factors, or emotional and psychological barriers, students can develop targeted strategies to engage more effectively in their learning journey. Through thoughtful self-reflection, open communication, and a willingness to challenge oneself, both students and teachers have the power to transform dull classrooms into thriving, inspired spaces for growth and learning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yusuke Hasegawa said it was his job \\"to convince\\" the double world champion of Honda's credentials before he made a decision on his future. Alonso is out of contract at the end of the season and says he will make a decision on his future in September. Hasegawa said Honda planned a series of updates over the next few races. The first of these is being introduced at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix and has led to a grid penalty for Alonso's team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne. The Belgian has a new power-unit that has led to a nominal 35-place penalty and means he will start from the back of the grid. Vandoorne is using what Honda calls its 'Phase 3.6' engine in Belgium, which features a change to the induction design. Alonso also has an upgrade - to the so-called 'Phase 3.5' engine - but Honda is allowed to do this without penalty because the parts that needed changing on his engine did not fall under those on which changes are restricted. Hasegawa said the improvements for this race over the specification of engine Alonso used in the last race in Hungary were worth about 0.1secs. Alonso said he was expecting \\"very difficult races\\" in Belgium this weekend and Italy next because they are the two circuits on the calendar where lap time is most dependent on engine performance. The 36-year-old Spaniard said on the pre-Belgian Grand Prix media day on Thursday that he had \\"not been told much (about the Honda upgrade) and I'm not expecting much\\". McLaren are in the process of deciding whether to drop their works contract with Honda at the end of this year, after three difficult seasons plagued by poor reliability and performance, and switch to a customer supply from Renault. A month ago, a move to the French company seemed the favoured option and it remains a possibility, but the chances of staying with Honda have increased over F1's summer break in August. Mercedes and Ferrari have already turned McLaren down and Renault are also said to be reluctant to provide them engines because the competitiveness of the British team's car means it is quite likely they would beat the factory Renault team and possibly even lead customer Red Bull. Alonso was asked whether he felt McLaren had a difficult decision to make over its engine supply in 2018. He replied: \\"I don't think there is any tough choice.\\" Alonso has said his \\"priority\\" is to stay in F1 but has also said he wants a competitive car so he can return to winning races.

Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator. Hint: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding The answer to this question is:","completion":"Animal B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: Is Quora uniquely suitable for scientists with low frustration tolerance? Question 2: What are the top frustrations unique to Millennials in today's workplace? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking about two different topics. Let's break down each question to understand them more clearly. Question 1: \\"Is Quora uniquely suitable for scientists with low frustration tolerance?\\" This question focuses on the platform Quora and whether it is a good fit for scientists who have low frustration tolerance. Quora is a question-and-answer platform where users generate and answer each other's questions about various topics. The question's context suggests that the scientists in question might become easily frustrated with typical research or peer review processes, or perhaps the formatting of information in other platforms. Therefore, the question seeks to identify whether Quora can be a more suitable platform for those scientists. A detailed answer to this question might include an analysis of Quora's features, its user interface, and the type of content that's usually available there. Some advantages of Quora might include the ability to quickly find answers to specific questions, the presence of experts, and the community-building aspect of the platform. However, one may also discuss the fact that information on Quora is not always reliable or reviewed thoroughly by experts, which may be a downside for scientists who require accurate and specific information. Question 2: \\"What are the top frustrations unique to Millennials in today's workplace?\\" This question tackles the subject of Millennials and the frustrations they commonly face in the workplace. Millennials refer to the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s to early 2000s. This question asks for the top unique frustrations these individuals face, which implies that there might be challenges specific to this generation that were not present or not as pressing for previous generations. A detailed answer to this question might include insights into the modern workplace, the expectations and values of Millennials, and how these factors can contribute to unique frustrations. Some potential issues could be the lack of job stability or job-hopping, the impact of automatization and AI on job opportunities, the increased need for adaptability and continuous learning, the work-life balance struggles, student loan debt, underemployment, and the need for regular feedback or a sense of purpose in their work. In conclusion, the first question is centered on Quora as a platform and its suitability for a specific group of scientists, while the second question is focused on the workplace challenges and frustrations faced by the Millennial generation. Although both questions involve the concept of frustration, they address separate issues and are not asking the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the United States of America.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Why did the Latin Americas Upper class support coup o'etats?\\" Possible answers: (I). yes; (II). no;","completion":"(II). No; The sentence \\"Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the United States of America\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"Why did the Latin Americas Upper class support coup d'etats?\\" because it only states that military dictatorships were supported by the United States of America. It does not specifically address the reasons behind the Latin America's Upper class supporting coup d'etats. To provide a more valid answer to the question, we need to analyze and delve into the historical and social context of that time period in Latin America. Multiple reasons contributed to the upper class supporting coup d'etats, some of which include: 1. Preservation of power and status: The upper class in Latin America was often composed of landowners, industrialists, high-ranking military officials, and members of old, powerful families. They aimed to maintain their power and status and were therefore supportive of coup d'etats when they felt their positions were being threatened by democratically-elected governments, especially those with leftist or socialist ideologies. 2. Fear of communism and socialism: During the period of the Cold War, Latin America was a battleground for political ideologies. The United States was strongly against communism, and as a result, was willing to back right-wing military dictatorships in the region to prevent the spread of communism. Many members of the upper class in Latin America shared this anti-communist sentiment and were worried about the potential consequences of socialist policies, such as wealth redistribution or land reforms. This led them to support coup d'etats that aimed to overthrow leftist governments. 3. Economic interests: Latin America's upper class was heavily invested in various industries, such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. They often had strong ties to multinational corporations and benefited from the economic policies of right-wing dictatorships. These regimes consistently favored pro-business policies that served the interests of the upper class and foreign investors, while neglecting the needs of the working class and the poor. As a result, the upper class supported coup d'etats that aimed to maintain or establish such economic policies. 4. Authoritarian inclinations: Some members of Latin America's upper class saw strong, authoritarian leadership as a more efficient and effective way to govern their countries. They regarded democratically-elected governments as weak and incapable of maintaining order or addressing chronic economic and social problems. This led them to support coup d'etats that promised strong, authoritarian rule and an improvement in the overall governance. In summary, the sentence provided does not give a valid answer to the question about the reasons behind the support of coup d'etats by Latin America's Upper class. The answer should encompass a discussion of the preservation of power and status, fear of communism and socialism, economic interests, and authoritarian inclinations as the main factors that contributed to their support for coup d'etats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate... contains an answer for the question: In what year did the colony established by Robert Cavelier de La Salle fail?, what is it ?

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.

It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish . - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Ictalurus is a genus of North American freshwater catfishes. It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\"). - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States. - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Given the question: Process: - Bacteria enter the body - Bacteria start to divide and grow - The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells - Other cells cannot function properly - We feel unwell - The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins - Toxins harm the body - The body tries to react to the toxins - The body&#x27;s natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer bacteria divide and grow happens, how will it affect MORE SEVERE disease occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer bacteria dividing and growing can have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process and the likelihood of more severe disease occurring. Let's go step by step to explain how this perturbation can impact the process: 1. Bacteria enter the body: Regardless of the perturbation hypothesis, bacteria will still enter the body. However, the fewer bacteria dividing and growing might result in fewer bacteria overall, which could potentially reduce the severity and effectiveness of the infection. 2. Bacteria start to divide and grow: Here is where the perturbation takes place. Fewer bacteria dividing and growing means that the overall bacterial population may not increase as rapidly, and there might be a lower overall bacterial count. 3. The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells: With fewer bacteria present and growing, there may be less competition for resources with our body's cells. This could result in less stress and damage to other cells, potentially reducing the severity of the disease. 4. Other cells cannot function properly: Since there are fewer bacteria present, the dysfunction of other cells in our body might not be as severe, allowing them to function better and cope with the bacterial infection. 5. We feel unwell: The overall feeling of being unwell might be reduced due to fewer bacteria and less impact on our body's cells. 6. The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins: With fewer bacteria dividing and growing, the production of toxins might be reduced, leading to less harm to the body. 7. Toxins harm the body: With fewer toxins produced, there may be less overall harm to the body, potentially reducing the severity of the disease. 8. The body tries to react to the toxins: The body's response to the toxins might be more effective due to the lower toxin levels. This could make it easier for our immune system to combat the infection. 9. The body's natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell: Although the body's natural defenses might still cause us to feel unwell, the overall reaction might be less severe due to fewer toxins and bacteria. In summary, the perturbation of fewer bacteria dividing and growing has a direct effect on the overall bacterial growth, toxin production, and competition with our body's resources. This, in turn, can have an indirect effect on the severity of the disease, as our immune system might be more effective in combating a less aggressive bacterial infection, potentially leading to a less severe disease outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Poll: Clinton maintains 50-point lead among Latinos Hillary Clinton is maintaining a 50-point lead over Donald Trump among Latino voters heading into the final weeks of the presidential election, and more Latinos now say they they're very interested in the November contest, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll. The poll found that 67 percent of Latino likely voters back Clinton in a four-way matchup, while just 17 percent back Trump. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein each garner three percent support. In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton leads Trump among Latino likely voters, 70 percent to 17 percent. Clinton's margins are similar to the advantage she enjoyed in a mid-SeptemberNBC/WSJ/Telemundo oversample of Latino voters. But the new data also show that interest in the election among Latinos has increased. That's a boon for the Democratic candidate as she works to build a winning coalition in an election cycle that pits two historically unpopular candidates against each other. Sixty-nine percent of Latino voters now say they are very interested in the election, compared to 60 percent who said the same last month. And more than eight in ten - 82 percent - say they are absolutely certain to vote, a share that rivals pre-election polling before President Barack Obama's win in the 2012 presidential election. Related: Clinton Holds 11-Point National Lead Over Trump: NBC/WSJ Poll What's more, the increase in interest in the election among Latinos has come largely from groups most likely to support Clinton, including younger voters, Democratic-leaning Latinos and those who speak primarily Spanish. Trump's favorability among Latinos remains strikingly low. The new poll shows that 80 percent view him negatively, compared with just 13 percent who view him positively.

This was followed in the 2nd quarter by Manning finding Hicks again on a 12-yard TD pass. The Texans tried to cut the lead when kicker Neil Rackers hit a 38-yard field goal, which was responded by Lawrence Tynes' 45-yard field goal.

A rushing touchdown means that the player ran with the football into the area where points are scored, which is called the end zone. The players who scored rushing touchdowns are Brandon Jacobs from the Giants, who ran 1 yard to score a touchdown, and Derrick Ward from the Texans, who also ran 1 yard to score a touchdown.

He is treated for the rattlesnake bite by a Native American medicine man who advises him to reconnect with his family in order to save his life. This sets the stage for Samuel to return to his estranged daughter, Maggie Gilkeson's (Cate Blanchett), ranch in New Mexico. Maggie is initially very hostile towards Samuel due to his abandonment of the family years prior, but she reluctantly accepts his help after her older daughter Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) is kidnapped by a group of dangerous criminals, who plan to sell her into prostitution in Mexico. Unable to rely on the local authorities for help, Maggie and Samuel set out on a journey, alongside Maggie's younger daughter Dot (Jenna Boyd), to rescue Lilly and bring her home safely. As they track the kidnappers and navigate harsh terrain, the characters must confront their past and learn to rely on one another. Throughout this difficult journey, they also encounter various challenges and life-threatening situations, including the rattlesnake bite that Samuel has to endure. In summary, it is a Native American medicine man who treats Samuel Jones' rattlesnake bite in \\"The Missing.\\" This event plays a significant role in the plot, as it leads to Samuel reuniting with his family and subsequently assisting them in rescuing his kidnapped granddaughter.

Chuck Hagel as his nominee to become the next defense secretary and Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan as the nominee for CIA director on Monday, administration officials told CNN. Two sources close to Hagel have also been told to expect the defense secretary announcement on Monday, and additional sources - a senior administration official and a source familiar with the nomination - said Obama spoke to Hagel Sunday by telephone. The White House was calling senators' offices Sunday to inform them Hagel's nomination is imminent and to help build support for it, a source familiar with the nomination said. CNN reported Friday that the White House had told some senior members of Congress to expect the tapping of Hagel, and another source with knowledge of the nomination called it \\"locked down.\\" At the CIA, Obama plans to nominate Brennan to replace retired Gen. David Petraeus includes and acting CIA Director Michael Morell, according to a senior administration official. The announcement is expected Monday afternoon at the same time Obama nominates Hagel, the official said. Petraeus stepped down from his post in November amid revelations he had engaged in an extramarital affair with his biographer. Morell, a career intelligence officer who was serving as the spy agency's deputy director, stepped in as acting CIA director upon Petraeus' resignation. For Hagel, getting to the Pentagon will mean overcoming already vocal opposition from pro-Israel groups and others who object to his stance on Iran and Hamas. He has also faced opposition from gay rights groups, who were strong supporters of Obama's election campaigns, for a comment Hagel made in 1998 in which Hagel questioned whether a nominee for ambassadorship was suitable because he was \\"openly, aggressively gay.\\" He apologized for that remark in December. On Sunday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham labeled Hagel's expected nomination as \\"in your face,\\" expressing concerns on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" about Hagel's past positions on Iran and Israel, which have been the subject of scrutiny since his name was first floated as a potential defense secretary five weeks ago. MORE: GOP Senators: Hagel in for a fight Republicans have also struck upon comments in a 2007 interview that some perceive as anti-Jewish, when Hagel said the \\"Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers.\\" They've also lambasted positions Hagel took as a GOP senator, including his opposition to unilateral sanctions against Iran, as well as votes opposing the labeling of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. He also opposed the \\"surge\\" of troops in Iraq favored by then-President George W. Bush and members of his administration. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said Sunday that Hagel would receive a \\"thorough vetting\\" just like any other presidential nominee. \\"Whoever is nominated for secretary of defense is going to have to have a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat, and the importance of having a robust military,\\" McConnell said on ABC's \\"This Week.\\" \\"So whoever that is I think will be given a thorough vetting. And if Sen. Hagel is nominated, he'll be subjected to the same kinds of review of his credentials as anyone else.\\" A veteran of the Vietman War, Hagel served, by a clerical mistake, side by side with his younger brother, and earned two Purple Hearts, one of those for saving his brother's life. His time in Vietnam would end up forging his thoughts about combat for the rest of his life, and defining his tenure on Capitol Hill as a U.S. Senator with an independent streak, often sidestepping his Republican colleagues. \\"Not that I'm a pacifist, I'm a hard-edged realist, I understand the world as it is, but war is a terrible thing. There's no glory, only suffering,\\" he is quoted in his 2006 biography.

Hagel has said in the past that be believes the Pentagon's budget is overweight. \\"The Defense Department, I think in many ways, has been bloated,\\" Hagel said in a September 2011 interview with the Financial Times. \\"So I think the Pentagon needs to be pared down.” CNN's John King, Athena Jones, Gloria Borger, Mark Preston, Dan Lothian, Lesa Jansen, Mike Mount, Kevin Bohn and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.

The Replacements were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979. Initially a punk rock band, they are considered pioneers of alternative rock. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson and drummer Chris Mars for most of its career. Following several acclaimed albums, including Let It Be and Tim, Bob Stinson left the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. The band soon recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement and handed it to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis, and had also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, \\"Raised in the City\\", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. \\"If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in\\", said Jesperson. \\"I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode\\". Jesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, \\"So do you want to do a single or an album?\\" With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980. Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed, and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later that summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday \\"New Band Night\\". They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. \\"His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely,\\" Mars later said. \\"His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force.\\" After the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write new songs and soon had a whole album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album. Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981.

Answer:","completion":"The name of the small rural town in South Australia that the Victor Harbor Road bypasses is Mount Compass. Located approximately 55 kilometers south of Adelaide, Mount Compass sits in the heart of the Fleurieu Peninsula and serves as a crucial point between Adelaide and the famous tourist destination of Victor Harbor. Mount Compass was established in the 19th century with its primary industries being dairy farming, market gardening, and timber. Over the years, the town has evolved into a vibrant community with the growth of agriculture, viticulture, and tourism industries. The Victor Harbor Road, which serves as the main route between Adelaide and Victor Harbor, was a busy road and an inconvenience for the local residents of Mount Compass due to the increased traffic flow, particularly during holiday seasons. To address this issue, a bypass was planned and constructed around Mount Compass starting in the early 2000s. The Mount Compass Bypass is approximately 6.5 kilometers long, running to the west of the town. It was officially opened on 17th December 2004, allowing motorists to safely navigate the route without passing through the town's center. The bypass has significantly reduced traffic congestion and increased road safety around Mount Compass, resulting in a more enjoyable driving experience for both travelers and the local community. Today, Mount Compass retains its charming rural atmosphere and has become a popular spot for tourists to visit, boasting beautiful countryside scenery, wineries, and a world-class golf course. Additionally, the town's local heritage, rich history, and vibrant community spirit make Mount Compass a unique and welcoming destination in South Australia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide \\"in the closet\\" to protect his \\"reputation\\"! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust.","completion":"Based on the content of the movie review, it can be classified as a positive review. The reviewer has praised the performances of the actors, appreciated the appearances of the actors and actresses, and has drawn a comparison with The Princess Bride, highlighting how Stardust stands out in terms of making the audience believe in the events portrayed on screen. Additionally, the reviewer ends with a recommendation, which further confirms the positive nature of this movie review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel’s laws and was supported by the following observations: • During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of other chromosome pairs. • The sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random. • Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their chromosomal complement. • Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the same number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent. • The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents. Choices: - receptors - neutrons - atoms - chromosomes A: Answer:","completion":"chromosomes The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance states that during meiosis, each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their chromosomal complement. This theory is supported by several observations, including the random sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-gametes, the equal number of chromosomes in male and female gametes, and the combination of gametic chromosomes during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents. In the process of meiosis, the cell undergoes two rounds of division to produce four haploid cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. The reduction in chromosome number is crucial for the formation of gametes, as it ensures that the offspring resulting from the fusion of these gametes (during fertilization) will have the correct chromosome number, maintaining genetic stability across generations. In humans, for instance, each somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes – 23 from the mother and 23 from the father. During the formation of gametes, the chromosome number is reduced to 23 through meiosis, so that when sperm and egg combine during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the proper chromosome count of 46. The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which is consistent with Mendel's laws of inheritance, has been further supported by advances in the understanding of DNA and genetics. It has provided an essential framework for the study of inheritance patterns and the role of chromosomes in transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy.

Answer the following question: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \\"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \\"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile. Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953. Who are most likely to benefit from the 3G services at Mount Everest? A) The telecom firm. B) The local residents. C) Travelers to Nepal. D) Mount Everest explorers. Answer:","completion":"D) Mount Everest explorers The installation of 3G services at Mount Everest will be most beneficial to Mount Everest explorers, including climbers, hikers, and mountaineering enthusiasts. With access to high-speed internet and communication services such as video calls, these individuals can stay connected with their friends, family, and support teams while undertaking their expeditions. This enhanced connectivity not only provides a means for sharing their experiences in real-time but also offers an additional layer of safety, as climbers can now communicate more easily with rescue teams and base camps in case of emergencies. Additionally, the availability of 3G services is also likely to benefit the numerous tourists who visit the Everest region each year as it can enhance their experience and contribute to an increased sense of security. While it is true that the telecom firm, TeliaSonera, would also benefit from the addition of the 3G services on Mount Everest, given their potential to expand their market share and attract more clients, it is the Mount Everest explorers who would experience the most direct and immediate advantages of these improved communication capabilities.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- It's said nothing is certain in life except for death and taxes. For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death. They fear one of Europe's top leagues, newly resurgent following significant investment from mega wealthy Qataris and Russians, could be irreparably damaged by the tax. On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a 1.35 million. The clubs have been lobbying hard against the tax, arguing it endangers their future. It's estimated the tax could increase their costs by up to 30%.

The tax has sparked outrage among the teams and players who have witnessed a revival of the French league due to the massive investments made by foreign investors like the Qataris and Russians. The introduction of this tax could lead to an exodus of talent from France to other European countries where taxes on high-income athletes are comparatively lower. As team owners and club managers scramble to find a compromise that would ensure financial stability and sustainability, they are also evaluating alternative revenue streams, such as commercial partnerships, broadcasting rights, and merchandise sales, which can offset the impact of this tax. Furthermore, clubs will require strategic planning and cost management to ensure they don't go over budget when it comes to player salaries. Another potential cause for concern is the damage the tax could do to the competitiveness of French clubs on a European level, compared to their counterparts in leagues such as England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga, and Germany's Bundesliga. Already, French clubs have struggled in recent years with retaining and attracting top-tier talent, and this tax would only exacerbate that issue. Consequently, this could lead to a shift in the power dynamics within European football and a significant decline in the quality of play within the French league. To mitigate the impact of this tax, French clubs might be forced to focus on nurturing and developing homegrown talent, through investments in youth academies and local player scouting networks. This short-term strategy could help alleviate the financial burden of high-priced foreign players, while at the same time, fostering a longer-term vision of creating a pool of domestic talent that could compete at the highest level. This might also lead to greater collaboration between the clubs and the French Football Federation to ensure a stable and well-structured football ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. In conclusion, the French football clubs' worry about the new tax law is thoroughly justified, as it directly affects their financial growth and competitiveness on the international stage. It will take a combination of short-term cost management and long-term strategic planning, as well as potential changes in the legal and regulatory framework of French football, to counterbalance the negative effects of this tax. The football clubs, players, and federation will need to collaborate closely and innovate in new directions to protect the growth, revival, and sustainability of French football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"The equation you've provided is a simple algebraic equation with the variable m. You want to solve for m, which means isolating m on one side of the equation and moving all the constants to the other side. The equation given is 386*m = 380*m - 12. In order to solve for m, we can start by bringing like terms together by subtracting 380*m from both sides. This will begin to isolate m on one side of the equation. 386*m - 380*m = 380*m - 380*m - 12 This simplifies to: 6*m = -12 The next step is to isolate m by dividing through by the coefficient of m on the left-hand side of the equation, which is 6. (6*m) / 6 = -12 / 6 This division yields the solution: m = -2 Therefore, the solution to the equation 386*m = 380*m - 12 is m = -2. To check the solution, you can substitute -2 in place of m in the original equation and simplify both sides to see if it's equal. Substituting m = -2 in the original equation yields 386*(-2) = 380*(-2) - 12, which simplifies to -772 = -772, confirming that -2 is indeed the solution to the equation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: To clean an electric razor.","completion":"The best way to clean an electric razor involves several steps to ensure its optimal performance and longevity. Different electric razors may have slightly different cleaning processes, so make sure to refer to the manufacturer's instructions. Here is a general step-by-step guide to clean an electric razor: 1. Unplug and disassemble: Safety comes first. Unplug the razor from the power source to avoid any electrical hazards. Carefully disassemble the razor according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, you'll need to detach the shaving head, foil or cutter, and any other removable parts. 2. Brush off hair and debris: Start by using a small, soft-bristle brush (usually provided with the razor) to gently brush away hair and debris from the shaving head, foil, and cutter. Make sure to brush in the direction of the cutting elements to avoid damaging them. 3. Rinse with water: If your electric razor is waterproof or water-resistant, you can rinse the shaving head, foil, and cutter under running water. Use warm water with a bit of dish soap or mild detergent to remove any stubborn residue. If your razor isn't waterproof, avoid using water and stick to the brush for cleaning. 4. Disinfect the blades: Wipe the exterior and interior surfaces of the razor with a cotton pad soaked in some rubbing alcohol. This will sanitize and disinfect the blades, preventing any bacterial growth. 5. Dry the components: Make sure to pat dry all the parts with a towel, and let them air-dry completely. This is crucial as any remaining moisture can lead to rusting and impaired performance. 6. Lubricate the blades: Once the components are dry, apply a thin layer of electric razor lubricant or oil to the blades. This ensures smooth operation and maintains the cutting performance of the razor. 7. Reassemble the razor: After all the components are clean, dry, and lubricated, carefully reassemble the electric razor according to the manufacturer's instructions. 8. Perform a test run: Turn on the razor and check for any unusual sounds or vibrations. If everything seems normal, your razor is ready for use. Remember to clean your electric razor regularly, preferably after every few uses, to ensure its optimal performance and longevity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This version will have commentary from hosts Katie Couric who was tapped to place Matt Lauer after his firing and Mike Tirico who replaced Bob Costas as NBC’s prime-time host after a nearly three-decade run. Tirico made his prime-time debut Thursday night. The Washington Post’s Rick Maese caught up with him before the Games to learn more about his new high-profile assignment. “I think trying to be Bob would be stupid. And that was one of his bits of advice: Be yourself ” Tirico said. “So I’m going to try to do that.” For the full Q&A scroll down to the “Olympics Corner” section of this newsletter. For 11 straight Summer and Winter Games — dating back to 1992 — Bob Costas served as the familiar and reliable face of the Olympics. But Costas is sitting out the PyeongChang Games and has passed the torch to Tirico who will serve as NBC’s prime-time host starting with Friday’s Opening Ceremonies. Tirico joined the network in 2016 after more than two decades at ESPN and was a daytime host of the Rio Games. He recently spoke with The Washington Post’s Rick Maese about his new high-profile assignment. Q: It’s not like you’re a newcomer to this broadcasting game but did you seek out Costas for any advice? A: There’s been a longtime friendship there. I don’t think that’s overstating it. And I can’t imagine this job changing hands more smoothly. Bob has been unbelievable in making himself available if I have any questions. I know I can pick up the phone during the Games and if I have a question I know I’ll get an honest answer. Bob ’s the all-time best. Bob set a standard for the amount of times he did this and the way he did it that likely won’t be matched ever again. So I’m not replacing him ; I’m following him .

What is the answer to this question? what was the original purpose of the rhode island colony?","completion":"The original purpose of the Rhode Island Colony traces back to the early 17th century when a group of English settlers, seeking religious freedom and a more tolerant environment than the Puritan-dominated Massachusetts Bay Colony, established the colony. Rhode Island, officially known as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, was founded by Roger Williams in 1636 in present-day New England, the United States of America. The primary purpose of the Rhode Island Colony was to provide religious freedom and separation of church and state for its inhabitants. At the time, England experienced an intense period of religious persecution and conflict, prompting dissenters to search for an accepting atmosphere to openly practice their religious beliefs and build communities based on tolerance and mutual respect. Therefore, Rhode Island Colony emerged as a beacon of hope for religious outcasts and political dissenters. Roger Williams, an influential theologian and a proponent of religious tolerance, was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his opposition to the rigid Puritan establishment, advocating for the insulation of civil matters from religious ones. As a result, Williams ventured southwards and formed the settlement of Providence in 1636, which later became the foundation of Rhode Island Colony. He was joined by individuals like Anne Hutchinson, who suffered a similar fate as Williams, banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony facing charges of heresy. Some key features that made the Rhode Island Colony distinctly different from other colonies in the 17th century include: 1. Religious Freedom: Rhode Island was probably the first colony to truly embrace religious freedom by not only allowing settlers to practice their faith without interference but granting full citizenship rights to people from diverse religious backgrounds. With this approach, Williams and other Rhode Islanders sought to create a secure and inclusive environment for diverse communities, including Quakers, Baptists, Jews, and others. 2. Separation of Church and State: Unlike the neighboring colonies, Rhode Island Colony refused to incorporate an established state church. This forward-thinking decision contributed significantly to the principle of the separation of Church and State, now recognized as a fundamental tenet of American democracy. 3. Political Independence: As a self-governing entity, Rhode Island Colony had a strong desire to preserve its political independence from England. However, it would not be until 1663, after a prolonged struggle for formal recognition, that Rhode Island would be officially granted a charter by King Charles II, guaranteeing specific rights and privileges. 4. Interaction with native tribes: Unlike the other colonies that engaged in frequent conflicts with native tribes, Rhode Island, under the leadership of Roger Williams, sought peaceful relations. Williams learned the Narragansett language and helped establish trade and mutual respect between the indigenous people and the colonists. In conclusion, the original purpose of Rhode Island Colony was to provide a haven of religious freedom and tolerance for individuals persecuted for their beliefs in England and other neighboring colonies. It also aimed to create an equitable and democratic society with a distinct separation of church and state while fostering mutual respect and interaction with the local indigenous population."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How does O'Barry show the delegates that the dolphin killings are happening?

Rick O'Barry, a charismatic and enigmatic environmental activist, discovers the disturbing truth behind the dolphin slaughters in Oceania. Armed with a passion for saving marine life and evidence of the gruesome killings, O'Barry's mission is to reveal this terrible secret to the world and put an end to the slaughter once and for all. The United Nations convenes a global environmental summit to address pressing marine and wildlife conservation issues. O'Barry sees this as the perfect opportunity to confront the delegates and expose the dolphin slaughterings. Knowing that diplomatic channels are often marred by bureaucracy and corruption, he devises an audacious plan to force immediate action. O'Barry straps a TV to his chest, containing the horrifying scenes of the dolphin massacres. He infiltrates the conference, disrupting the proceedings with his shocking entrance. With all eyes on him, he plays the gruesome footage of the killings, leaving the summit delegates speechless and horrified. The harrowing images of the innocent dolphins bring about instantaneous, visceral reactions from the crowd, forcing them to acknowledge the urgent need to protect these majestic creatures from unnecessary suffering. Rick O'Barry makes an impassioned plea to the international community, urging them to act swiftly to ban the slaughter and protect the dolphins of Oceania. However, a powerful and sinister organization operating in the shadows has a vested interest in keeping the dolphin killings going and will stop at nothing to silence O'Barry. They attempt to discredit, intimidate, and eventually endanger both Rick and his loved ones. As the stakes grow higher, so does the intensity of O'Barry's fight for justice.

Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya's supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favour at Zápolya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Zápolya. After Zápolya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected Báthory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573 Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania. He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position. How many different roles did Báthory have as a supporter of Zápolya?","completion":"Stephen Báthory had three major roles as a supporter of John II Sigismund Zápolya. These roles were: 1. Feudal lord: As a prominent member of the noble Hungarian Báthory family, he held a significant position in the hierarchy of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. His status allowed him to support Zápolya's cause from within the official power structure and provide resources for the struggle. 2. Military commander: Báthory's experience in the military made him an important asset for Zápolya's campaign. He took part in battles and acted as a key leader in their efforts to counter Ferdinand I and the Holy Roman Empire. His ability to coordinate troops and devise battle strategies was crucial in the ongoing power struggle. 3. Diplomat: Due to his connections both locally and abroad, Báthory served as a diplomat for Zápolya, engaging in negotiations and forging alliances. One example of this is when he visited Vienna and was subsequently put under house arrest for two years. Despite the setback, his diplomatic skills allowed him to remain a vital part of Zápolya's power base. In summary, as a supporter of John II Sigismund Zápolya, Stephen Báthory served in three distinct roles: feudal lord, military commander, and diplomat. These positions enabled him to contribute significantly to the success of Zápolya's political ambitions and to the overall power struggle in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: Danish entrepreneur Martin Nielsen never planned to live in Africa. He travelled from his base in London to Kenya in 2012 to spend three months working with 88mph, a seed investment firm based in Kenya, where he launched Mdundo, a mobile platform for downloadable African music. Originally, Nielsen intended to manage the business from Europe, but he soon relocated to Kenya after finding the local and regional market a much more attractive place for entrepreneurs. Martin Nielsen (left), Founder & CEO, MdundoCredit: Mdundo In three years, Nielsen’s business, Mdundo, has become one of the continent’s leading music service sites with more than 1,000,000 active users every month, mainly from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Nigeria. More than 25,000 musicians – well known, and undiscovered, from across Africa contribute to Mdundo, earning revenue every time a user downloads their music. Nielsen believes the same level of growth would have been impossible in Europe. He says there are many compelling reasons for entrepreneurs to consider relocating to smaller markets relevant to their business plans. Amy Guttman: Why did decide to relocate to Africa? Martin Nielsen: The startup space is less crowded here and the problems are much more visible. You cannot go for a walk in Europe without someone talking about starting a business to solve a problem that likely doesn’t exist. Here, problems are real and practical solutions are valuable. Guttman: Basing Mdundo in Kenya makes sense, since the business is Africa-focused. Why does it make sense for other founders to relocate to Africa? Nielsen: Three things stand out as being much easier for starting a business in Africa, than Europe. The way we clear rights here is very similar to Soundcloud because of the difficulty of acquiring music rights in Africa (for Soundcloud the issue is DJ mixes) and we follow the same monetisation philosophy than Spotify, however we build our products to tailor for a wide range of low end devices and we tailor our payment systems to mobile money solutions currently penetrating the African market. Nielsen is currently raising funds to expand Mdundo to six new territories: Mozambique, Rwanda, Zambia, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria.","completion":"\\"From London to Kenya: The Unplanned Journey of Mdundo's CEO, Martin Nielsen, and the Rise of African Music Downloads\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He felt that he'd ruin his relationship with Jen if he took it further, and he didn't want to do that. At the same time, He fight that pushing farther might do what to something good? Possible A: found, destroy, construct, fix, produce Why is \\"produce\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Produce\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it suggests the possibility of generating a positive outcome or result from taking the relationship further. The question clearly presents a dilemma that James is facing: he is torn between not wanting to ruin his relationship with Jen and considering the potential benefits of pushing farther. In this scenario, human common sense dictates that positive outcomes can be achieved if an action is carefully thought out and executed with the best intentions in mind. The term \\"produce\\" has a constructive connotation that implies creation, generation, or the bringing forth of something new or valuable. In the context of relationships, \\"producing\\" something positive typically suggests improved communication, stronger emotional connections, or reaching a milestone together as a couple. By associating this term with the possibility of pushing the relationship further, it gives a sense that there might be a silver lining or potential for growth if James decides to take this risk. This is in contrast to the other possible answers provided (i.e., found, destroy, construct, and fix). For example, \\"found\\" is not fully relevant to this particular situation, as it lacks a direct connection to creating a positive outcome or enriching a relationship. \\"Destroy\\" is clearly negative and would be counterintuitive to James's desire not to ruin his relationship with Jen. Similarly, \\"fix\\" implies that something is broken, which contradicts the initial concern James has about damaging a relationship that may not have any issues at present. Lastly, \\"construct\\" could also be seen as aligned with human common sense as it implies building something new, but \\"produce\\" might be more suitable as it encapsulates potential growth and creation of a thriving relationship for James and Jen. In conclusion, \\"produce\\" is the answer that aligns most closely with human common sense in this context. It acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties surrounding relationships and presents an optimistic outlook that suggests pushing the relationship further could lead to the cultivation of something good for James and Jen. This choice demonstrates the intricate understanding and intuition humans often have when it comes to decision-making, emotions, and interpersonal relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance. - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display.

Ted Haggard, the former megachurch pastor and former National Association of Evangelicals chief whose career was undone by a gay prostitution and drugs scandal in 2006, plans to start a new church. Standing in front of his barn, Haggard and his family announced Wednesday that they are starting a church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called Saint James. The church, which will not be affiliated with any denomination, will have its first gathering Sunday at the Haggard home. \\"All are welcome. Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, gay, straight, bi-[sexual], tall, short, addict, recovering addict. ... I believe Jesus' arms are open to all,\\" he said. In 2006, Haggard acknowledged having received a massage from a Denver, Colorado, man who said that the prominent pastor had paid him for sex over three years. Haggard also admitted he had bought methamphetamine but said he threw it away. Those statements led the Board of Overseers at New Life Church to fire Haggard as senior pastor. The church's independent investigative board said he was guilty of \\"sexually immoral conduct.\\" After the allegations were made public, Haggard resigned as president of the influential National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group representing more than 45,000 churches with 30 million members. As part of his severance package with New Life Church, Haggard was barred from speaking publicly for a year. After that time elapsed, he made various media appearances, including starring in a documentary on HBO about his life. Sunday's service will mark his first return to the ministry in a full-time capacity. \\"This is an emotional morning for me,\\" he told reporters.

The company says it plans to replace more than 60 separate policies for different products with one main policy. Privacy activists criticized last month's announcement. They are concerned that the new policy will make it easier to track the activities of users across Google's many products -- from Gmail to YouTube. Marc Rotenberg heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. He says Google's aim is to create a single unified profile of its users. \\"We believe that not only is that a threat to privacy, we actually believe it is illegal, because last year Google entered into an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission in which they said they would not engage in that kind of data sharing without the permission of their users.\\" Google says its new policy will make it simpler for users to share information across services like Google Search, Gmail and Google Calendar. And it says the new policy will help personalize each user's experience. Over time, it says, users can expect to see better search results, fewer unwanted advertisements and more content targeted to their interests. But Marc Rotenberg says in return, people who choose to use Google will lose control over the information they share. \\"The type of information you might provide for an e-mail service, for example, such as your address book, which contains private information, is different from the type of information that you might provide for a social network service where people purposely make information publicly available to their friends.\\" Mr. Rotenberg says these two kinds of services should be kept separate. \\"By trying to combine these two services, in our view, Google is actually undermining a very well established expectation of privacy, especially for popular Internet services like electronic mail.\\" Critics also see a bigger problem with Google's new policy. The plan would not give users a choice to drop out of the data sharing. \\"In our view, if... Question: What's Google's purpose to change its privacy policy according to Marc Rotenberg?

Let's break down the components of the phrase to further understand the dual nature of its tone: 1. \\"is hard to dismiss\\": This part of the sentence carries a positive connotation. It implies that the subject being described is too prominent, captivating, or intriguing to be disregarded or ignored. It evokes a sense of curiosity and interest in the reader or listener. 2. \\"moody\\": This word possesses a negative connotation. Moody generally refers to a person or situation that exhibits unpredictable and intense emotional shifts or swings. This can create an atmosphere of uncertainty, instability, or discomfort. 3. \\"thoughtful\\": This part of the phrase has a positive connotation. Thoughtful implies that the subject provokes deep thinking, introspection, or reflection. It suggests that the subject is engaging on an intellectual or philosophical level, which is generally seen as a desirable quality. 4. \\"and lit by flashes of mordant humor\\": This expression has both negative and positive aspects.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Food Network may need to wipe the egg off its face. It's being sued for stealing the idea and technique for a snow globe cupcakes how-to video by a woman who runs recipe site SugarHero.com. During the 2014 holiday season, Elizabeth LaBau posted a recipe instructing people on how to use gelatin sheets and small water balloons to make edible globes — which, when placed atop a cupcake, transform an otherwise commonplace dessert into a holiday novelty. The dessert recipe went \\"viral\\" the next year thanks to a Facebook post, LaBau says, and it got so much traction that it crashed her website. LaBau says her food passion is a full-time job and she relies on advertising revenue from her site to keep SugarHero afloat. That one viral post \\"more than tripled\\" her income that month, according to the suit filed Thursday in California federal court. Given the success of the recipe, LaBau decided to create a how-to video and posted it on Dec. 3, 2016. Three weeks later, she says, the Food Network posted a similar video on its Facebook page — and, now, LaBau is suing for copyright infringement, claiming it ripped off her work shot-for-shot and won't give her credit. Copyright law does not protect recipes that are \\"mere listings of ingredients\\" — but it does protect original works of authorship, and the U.S. Copyright Office website states that may include \\"expression\\" of a recipe such as \\"a description, explanation, or illustration.\\" So LaBau's suit raises an interesting legal question as to whether her how-to video warrants protection while the underlying recipe does not. \\"The Food Network video copied numerous copyrightable elements of Plaintiff’s work precisely, including but not limited to choices of shots, camera angles, colors, and lighting, textual descriptors, and other artistic and expressive elements of Plaintiff’s work,\\" writes LaBau's attorney William Bowen. \\"Defendants’ video as of the signing of this Complaint has garnered 145,000 likes and over 11,000,000 views, business and attention that would have gone to Plaintiff and her business but for Defendants’ wrongful acts.\\" Food Network declined to comment on the lawsuit, which is posted in full below. ||||| Food Network Sued Over Snow Globe Cupcakes How-To Video https://t.co/mZYStTb4ad — ZenCupcake™ {Robyn} (@MyZenCupcake) June 4, 2017 Elizabeth LaBau’s holiday cupcake recipe was so popular it crashed her food blog. It was clever, after all. LaBau, who runs SugarHero.com, had figured out a way to make edible snow globe cupcakes by coating small balloons in sheets of gelatin and letting them harden into translucent domes. After lots of trial and error, she posted the the recipe to her website in late 2014. It went viral in the days that followed, garnering about 740,000 shares on Facebook — the traffic caused her blog to go dark temporarily — and tripling her site’s income that month. She would go on to describe it as her “signature recipe.” LaBau continued to ride the recipe’s success last Christmas, posting a tutorial video showing how to make the cupcakes. Like her original post, the video was a major success for the do-it-yourself dessert maven, drawing millions of views in December alone. Then along came Food Network with a video of its own, LaBau says in a new lawsuit filed in federal court in California. About three weeks after she published her tutorial, LaBau alleges, Food Network produced a how-to video on snow globe cupcakes that was so similar that it constituted copyright infringement. LaBau’s lawsuit calls the minute-long, made-for-Facebook video a “shot-for-shot” theft of her own. The camera angles are the same, she says, along with the colors, lighting, text and other elements. Food Network “willfully and intentionally sought to appropriate” LaBau’s work “for their own profit without bearing the cost,” the lawsuit reads. “The time commitment of recipe development and the cost of ingredients, coupled with the time cost of photographing and videoing the cupcakes, was a substantial investment for Plaintiff, an individual who runs a website based solely on her own work.” A Food Network spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Because recipes can’t (for the most part) be copyrighted, LaBau’s lawsuit focuses specifically on the video that helped popularize the snow globe cupcakes. It calls the video a “proprietary work” and says Food Network’s version infringes on multiple copyrightable aspects of it. LaBau says her blog began as a passion project that bloomed into a full-time job “through years of hard work and late nights.” So when Food Network posted its video, it was not just taking her ideas but hurting her brand and depriving her of income, she alleges. “Competing with numerous corporate food websites, often backed by large companies with deep pockets, is very difficult as an individual and requires endless work,” the lawsuit reads. It cites several awards and accolades SugarHero has won in recent years, including being named “Best Baking Blog” by Better Homes and Gardens in 2015. LaBau said Food Network’s video caused her “severe distress,” distracting her from the normal business of running her blog, which features recipes for hundreds of holiday-themed desserts and other sweets. She said she contacted Food Network asking for it to remove the video or at least give her credit and attribution for her work, but to no avail. Her lawsuit seeks as much as 150,000 in damages per copyright infringement. The two videos follow the same format as many cooking tutorials found on food websites large and small, with each step in the recipe demonstrated in short, user-friendly segments as upbeat music plays in the background. Food Network’s version shows more professional-level studio production, but some moments in the footage are strikingly similar to those in LaBau’s video. Whether those similarities constitute copyright infringement is, of course, up to a federal judge to decide.

(Associated Press) Norway's Martin Johnsrud Sundby, left, and Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo celebrate after winning the gold medal in the men's team sprint freestyle cross-country skiing final at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2018. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (Associated Press) PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (AP) — Marit Bjoergen made Olympic history and the United States women's cross-country team won its first medal ever — and it was gold. Bjoergen won her 14th medal at the Winter Games by taking bronze with her Norwegian teammates on Wednesday in the team sprint. That made her the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, breaking the tie she held with Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen. Jessica Diggins and Kikkan Randall led the way as the American women pulled off a huge upset in the same race. The only other American to win a medal in cross-country skiing was Bill Koch, who took silver in the 30-kilometer race at the 1976 Innsbruck Games. The Americans posted the fastest time in the semifinals and started on the front row in the final. Diggins passed the Swedes and the Norwegians on the final lap to win the first Olympic gold medal for the United States in the sport. Sweden took silver. The 37-year-old Bjoergen has won four medals at the Pyeongchang Games. She took gold in the women's 4x5-kilometer relay, silver in the 15-kilometer skiathlon and bronze in the 10-kilometer freestyle. She still has one event remaining — the 30-kilometer mass start on Sunday — if she chooses to participate. Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo and Martin Johnsrud won the men's team sprint, giving Norway a 13th medal in cross-country events at Pyeongchang. A team of Russians took silver and France edged out Sweden for third. It was the third gold medal for Klaebo, equaling French biathlete Martin Fourcade for the most golds so far at Pyeongchang. The 21-year Klaebo became the fourth male athlete to win three gold medals at the Winter Games before turning 22, joining American speed skater Eric Heiden, Austrian Alpine skier Toni Sailer and South Korean short-track speedskater Ano Victor ___ More AP Olympics: https://wintergames.ap.org ||||| Media playback is not supported on this device Winter Olympics 2018: Norway's Marit Bjorgen creates history as USA win women's team cross XXIII Olympic Winter Games Venue: Pyeongchang, South Korea Dates: 9-25 February Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button, Connected TVs, BBC Sport website and mobile app. Full coverage times The United States won gold in the women's team sprint free as Marit Bjorgen became the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time. It was the first time the US have won a cross-country skiing medal in a women's event. Bjorgen, who took bronze with Norway, picked up her fourth medal at these Games and now has 14 overall. The 37-year-old has won a medal in every event she has contested in Pyeongchang. Swedish pair Charlotte Kalla and Stina Nilsson took silver. It was a three-way sprint going into the final stretch but American Jessica Diggins held off the challenge of Sweden's Nilsson to win with a photo finish. Norway's Maiken Caspersen Falla followed shortly in third, ensuring her compatriot won her 14th Winter Olympic medal. Diggins' teammate Kikkan Randall set a new record for most events before claiming a medal at the Winters, winning gold in her 18th attempt. \\"That is the race the USA have been waiting for for two or three decades,\\" BBC commentator Ollie Williams said. \\"They will be talking about this all over America.\\" American duo Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins celebrate winning gold BBC Sport's Rob Walker added: \\"This is huge for the sport in America. An amazing finish from two American women who have produced the race of their life against some of the all-time greats. \\"It has been a privilege to watch.\\" Bjorgen surpasses compatriot Ole Einar Bjorndalen, who won 13 medals including eight golds in biathlon, to become the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time. She can add another medal when she competes in the 30km classical event on Sunday. \\"It's hard to understand, actually,\\" she said. \\"When you're still an athlete you just have focus on other races.

Article: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute Forget diamonds in the sky — it may actually be raining diamonds on Saturn and Jupiter, according to two planetary scientists1. Researchers have long wondered whether the high pressures inside the giant planets could turn carbon into diamond2, and even though some researchers dispute their claim, Mona Delitsky of California Specialty Engineering in Flintridge, and Kevin Baines of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, now say it is possible. They are laying out their argument this week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences in Denver, Colorado. In their scenario, lightning zaps molecules of methane in the upper atmospheres of Saturn and Jupiter, liberating carbon atoms. These atoms then stick onto each other, forming larger particles of carbon soot, which the Cassini spacecraft may have spotted in dark storm clouds on Saturn3. As the soot particles slowly float down through ever-denser layers of gaseous and liquid hydrogen towards the planets' rocky cores, they experience ever greater pressures and temperatures. The soot is compressed into graphite, and then into solid diamonds before reaching a temperature of about 8,000 °C, when the diamond melts, forming liquid diamond raindrops, they say. Precious rain Image courtesy of Michael Carroll Alien Seas: Oceans in space (Springer 2013 ) Inside Saturn, the conditions are right for diamond 'hail' to form, beginning at a depth of about 6,000 kilometres into the atmosphere and extending for another 30,000 km below that, says Baines. He estimates that Saturn may harbour about 10 million tonnes of diamond produced this way, with most of it made up of rocks no bigger than a millimetre and perhaps some chunks spanning 10 centimetres. \\"If you had a robot there, it would sit there and collect diamonds raining down,\\" Baines says. Indeed, this is just what happens in a piece of sci-fi the authors wrote to augment a recent non-fiction book chapter4 on the science of Saturn's fluid atmosphere. In their vision of the year 2469, diamonds would be collected on Saturn and used to make the ultra-strong hulls of mining ships delving deep into the planet's interior to collect helium-3 for clean-burning fusion fuel. The diamonds must stay in Saturn to prevent havoc in financial markets on Earth. Delitsky and Baines concluded that diamond would be stable inside the giant planets by comparing recent studies that experimentally fleshed out the temperatures and pressures at which carbon takes on different forms5, such as solid diamond, and others that modelled the pressure and temperature at different depths within the giant planets6. \\"We put together two pieces of information from different sources to conclude that diamonds are likely to be existing in the deep interiors of Saturn and Jupiter,\\" says Delitsky. Thermodynamic objections But others dispute the researchers' claim, arguing that these two gas giants of the Solar System are probably devoid of bling. David Stevenson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, says the pair did not properly account for thermodynamics. Methane forms a very small fraction of the mostly hydrogen atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn – 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. In such dilute systems, \\"thermodynamics favours mixtures\\", says Stevenson. \\"It's the same thermodynamics that explains why a small amount of sugar or salt will dissolve in a large amount of water, especially at high temperature,\\" he says. \\"Even if you made carbon dust, it would just dissolve as it went down into the interior very very quickly.“ Luca Ghiringhelli, a physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, Germany, is also sceptical of the pair's conclusions. His own previous research7 showed that the concentration of carbon is not high enough in Uranus and Neptune — which are several times richer in carbon than Jupiter and Saturn — to grow diamond from the 'ground up', building the crystals atom by atom. He did not model whether diamond could instead form by the compression of soot, but says it is premature to assume that would do so. \\"It is very optimistic to drive conclusions on the existence of diamonds on Saturn from the scarce data we have, and without a convincing model,\\" he says. That may give financial regulators one less thing to worry about in the coming centuries. ||||| [ Watch the Video: Are There Diamonds On Saturn And Jupiter? ] Lee Rannals for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online Scientists speaking at the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society say that Saturn and Jupiter may hold what many consider to be the key to a woman’s heart: Diamonds. And lots of them. A team from the California Specialty Engineering and the University of Wisconsin, Madison said that Jupiter and Saturn could contain solid diamonds in their cores. The scientists say that liquid diamonds could also be found deeper inside the core because temperatures would be so high that the gems would melt. Scientists have believed for some time that Neptune and Uranus likely contain diamonds deep below their surfaces, but this is the first time a team has reported similar evidence for Jupiter and Saturn. The diamond core on Neptune and Uranus would most likely stay solid because the temperatures inside these planets are lower. “Previously, only Uranus and Neptune were thought to have conditions in their interiors that would allow the formation of diamond at their cores. It appears that the interior of Jupiter gets hot enough to reach the liquid diamond region of the carbon phase diagram, whereas the interior of Saturn includes regions of temperature and pressure where carbon could exist as solid diamond,” the researchers said in an abstract written about their findings. According to the researchers, diamonds in the solar system’s two biggest planets formed from methane found in their atmospheres. During lightning storms on these planets, this smelly gas blasts apart to create fluffy, jet-black soot similar to what is found inside a fireplace. The team traced where the soot ends up by using calculations developed by scientists to look deep inside planets. They also used recent data showing how carbon reacts to high temperatures and pressures. “As carbon descends through the atmosphere, amorphous carbon becomes graphite which then is converted into diamond, creating various strata of carbon allotropes according to their densities,” the researchers said. Findings revealed that the sinking soot first turns into graphite, which is a form of carbon used in pencils. As the bits of graphite continue their journey to the center of the planet, the growing pressure and temperature squeeze and heat them into specks of diamonds floating in a sea of helium and hydrogen. “This kind of study shows that we are still far from understanding the composition and structure of Jupiter and Saturn, two planets which are respectively about 300 and 100 times the mass of our Earth and were crucial players when the whole Solar System formed,” Tristan Guillot, planetary researcher at the Observatoire de la Cote d’Azur in France, told CNN. Although the idea of mining for diamonds on another planet seems intriguing, Peter Read, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, says we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves. He told CNN that diamonds in these planets would look different than what we have on Earth, adding that they could be clouds of condensed diamond material. Regardless of whether or not man will be able to actually utilize this resource in the future, the concept of a diamond core itself remains a subject of interest to scientists. The researchers said that Jupiter and Saturn could be holding “diamond rain” or even “diamond oceans.” “At the boundaries (locations of sharp increases in density) on Jupiter and Saturn, there may be diamond rain or diamond oceans sitting as a layer,” the team said. “However, in Uranus and Neptune, the temperatures never reach as high as 8,000K (14,000 Fahrenheit). The cores are -5,000K (-8,500 Fahrenheit), too cold for diamond to melt on these planets. Therefore, it appears that diamonds are forever on Uranus and Neptune but not on Jupiter and Saturn.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"It may be raining diamonds on Saturn and Jupiter, according to planetary scientists Mona Delitsky of California Specialty Engineering and Kevin Baines of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

In my first year out of high school in college, I didn’t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise. The next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn’t over - yet. Fast forward some 45–60 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. “His car crashed.”, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut. But as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights. The van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving. Basically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right.

It is a ceremonial county and a historic county, covered by three unitary authorities: Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, and Luton. - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels. - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. - Bedford is the county town of Bedfordshire, England. It had a population of 107,590 in 2011 together with Kempston but the urban area has a population of about 122,943. - Luton is a large town, borough and unitary authority area of Bedfordshire, England. Luton and its near neighbours, Dunstable and Houghton Regis, form the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area with a population of about 258,000. It is located east of Aylesbury, west of Stevenage, north-northwest of London, and southeast of Milton Keynes. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Shuttleworth College is a further education college in the village of Old Warden in Bedfordshire , England . The college is part of Bedford College , and mainly offers courses and training related to agriculture and the natural environment . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - Biggleswade is a market town and civil parish located on the River Ivel in Bedfordshire, England. It has grown in population by nearly 10% over the past decade, primarily due to good transport links, being situated along the A1 road between London and the North, as well as having a railway station on the main rail link North from London (the East Coast Main Line). New housing developments mean that expansion is predicted to continue into the foreseeable future. - Central Bedfordshire is a unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire, England. It was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009. With a budget of £500m the unitary council provides over a hundred services to a quarter of a million people, and is responsible for schools, social services, rubbish collection, roads, planning, leisure centres, libraries, care homes and more. - Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind. This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, and electrical properties and forces. On earth it includes: sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances. - A foundation degree is a combined academic and vocational qualification in higher education, equivalent to two thirds of an honours bachelor's degree, introduced by the government of the United Kingdom in September 2001. Foundation degrees are available in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, offered by universities, by colleges that have their own foundation degree awarding powers, and by colleges and employers running courses validated by universities. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - College (Latin: \\"collegium\\") is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, or an institution offering vocational education. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some part of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather, and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. - The East of England is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It was created in 1994 and was adopted for statistics from 1999. It includes the ceremonial counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Essex has the highest population in the region. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Old Warden is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England, just west of the town of Biggleswade. It has a population of 275, increasing to 328 at the 2011 Census. The village grew up under the protection of the Cistercian Wardon or Warden Abbey nearby. - Edexcel, now known as Pearson - London Examinations, is a multinational education and examination body owned by Pearson. Pearson Edexcel, the only privately owned examination board in the UK, and part of Pearson PLC, is a portmanteau term combining the words Education & Excellence. It regulates school examinations under the British Curriculum and offers qualifications for schools on the international and regional scale. Edexcel is the UKs largest awarding organisation offering academic and vocational qualifications in schools, colleges and work places in the UK and abroad. It is also recognised internationally. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A secondary school, often referred to as a high school or a senior high school, is a school which provides secondary education, between the ages of 11 and 19 depending on location, after primary school and before higher education. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude> - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - An apprenticeship is a system of training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading). Apprenticeship also enables practitioners to gain a license to practice in a regulated profession. Most of their training is done while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade or profession, in exchange for their continued labor for an agreed period after they have achieved measurable competencies. Apprenticeships typically last 3 to 6 years. People who successfully complete an apprenticeship reach the \\"journeyman\\" or professional certification level of competence. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.

(CNN) The family of a Mexican national fatally shot by police in Pasco, Washington, has filed a 25 million claim against the city alleging that three officers killed the unarmed man \\"execution style.\\" Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was shot by police Tuesday after he allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and Pasco officers. The city and the police department weren't commenting on the claim, Pasco City Manager Dave Zabell said Saturday. The case is attracting attention because a video posted on YouTube shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. The shooting has sparked local protests and anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force against an unarmed man who is a minority. Zambrano-Montes' widow, Teresa De Jesus Meraz Ruiz, 32, and the couple's two minor daughters accused three Pasco officers in \\"the murder\\" of Zambrano-Montes, according to the claim filed Friday. Antonio Zambrano-Montes One officer, Ryan Flanagan, \\"has a prior history of official misconduct in civil rights matters,\\" the claim alleges. The other two officers are Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz, the claim said. Flanagan is a nine-year veteran; Wright, a firearms instructor with eight years' experience; and Alaniz, an officer with two years on the job, officials said.

Police have alleged that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers. Officers attempted \\"voice commands and low level force,\\" and used a Taser, police said, but those efforts were unsuccessful. After two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force.

A very brief encounter occurred between Zambrano-Montes and police, \\"during which the officers may have tried to taser\\" him, the claim said. Zambrano-Montes separated from the officer and walked away from them in the crosswalk, the claim said. \\"He had his back to the officers,\\" the claim said. \\"At this point, the officers started shooting at Mr. Zambrano-Montes. \\"After Mr. Zambrano-Montes reached the other side of the street and got on the sidewalk, he continued to walk away from the officers with his hands out where they could be seen, again showing that he had no knife, no gun or nothing else in his hands that would cause a threat to the three officers who were then lined up on the sidewalk behind ...

About 500 people gathered at a park to protest the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, who was killed Tuesday after three officers chased him through a busy intersection with their guns drawn. As he turned to face them, raising his arms, he was felled by their bullets. According to police reports, Mr. Zambrano-Montes had been throwing rocks at cars and officers. His death was caught on video by a bystander and the footage has been widely disseminated on social media, fueling anger among the mainly Hispanic population of this quiet agricultural hub in southern Washington State, and drawing comparisons to the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo. “What happened could have happened to any family, to my family,” said Maria de los Angeles Perez, 42, who had come from nearby Kennewick to show her support. She began to cry softly as she signaled to her two sons, Santiago and Samuel. Mr. Zambrano-Montes’s family has settled in the region — many came here more than a decade ago to gather apples and asparagus in local fields. Dozens of cousins, aunts and neighbors attended the event. “We cannot count on a just government,” said one cousin, Rosa Cisneros-Zambrano, 50, in an interview before the protest. “Only on a just God.” Supporters held signs in English and Spanish, urging officers to “use your training not your guns” and calling for “protection, not intimidation.” One man, taking the microphone, yelled into the crowd “We are all Antonio.” But the protest held less vitriol than those that roiled Ferguson in the days after Mr. Brown’s death. Leaders here called for peace and demanded that protesters remove masks. The event was capped by a performance from a man named Fermin Cruz, 42, who strummed a guitar and sang a song called “El Inmigrante,” about a man who wished he were a tree, so he would never have had to leave his homeland. As he sang, many women held each other. Also at the protest was a group of four people who had come to show support for the Pasco police and set up folding chairs at the edge of the gathering. The group included Kenneth Taylor, 60, a retired police officer whose partner was killed during a traffic stop. “Social media has the tendency to incite people,” he said, adding that people should wait until a full investigation had been conducted before drawing conclusions about whether the shooting was lawful. “What’s upset me is the immediate conviction.” Police departments in the area have been involved in four other fatal shootings in the last seven months, and this one has drawn national attention to police practices in the Tri-Cities area, a group of municipalities with a population of about 250,000. The Pasco Police Department, in conjunction with neighboring departments, will conduct an investigation to determine whether charges should be brought against the officers. They have been placed on leave, pending the outcome. The coroner of Franklin County has said that he will order an inquest into the killing, a rare move that will allow a jury of six to determine whether the killing was justified. City officials chose not to participate in the demonstration — they did, however, listen to the protesters. Mid-protest, Dave Zabell, the city manager, was standing at the border of the gathering, dressed in khaki colors. He could hear voices booming over the microphone — and he commended residents for their measured response to the killing. “They’re trusting the process,” he said. ||||| But here in Pasco, a city of 68,000 that is 56 percent Hispanic, the public killing has pierced the immigrant enclave, spurring protests that have attracted hundreds and highlighting a division between the city’s increasingly Latino populace and its power structure — the police, the city government — which remains largely white. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While many Hispanics have found work and stable, if not particularly affluent, lives here, the killing has drawn attention to their lack of clout. And, as with blacks in Ferguson, it has intensified feelings among Hispanics that they remain second-tier residents, despite their deep roots here, defined by the many Latino shops that now dominate the main thoroughfare, Lewis Street. “They had him like a deer, hunting him,” said Maria Paniagua, 41, a resident with six children. “What happens when one of my kids gets in a jam and runs. Will they shoot him down?” Photo Though Latino workers have been here since at least the 1960s, attracted by jobs gathering fruit and asparagus in the region’s vast fields, few have moved into law enforcement or city government. Of the city’s 68 officers, 14 are Hispanic. A dozen officers speak Spanish fluently, and some residents cite language barriers that complicate interactions with the police. The City Council has one Latino member. The five-member school board, which oversees a system that is 70 percent Latino, typically has one or two Latino members, but this year has none. “People are finally getting their feelings out through this whole Antonio issue,” said Alicia Coria, 18, a former neighbor of Mr. Zambrano-Montes’s who moderated a recent protest, guiding a sea of Latino residents through local streets, signs and fists held high. “The Hispanic community is finally trying to have the power.” All three officers involved in last week’s shooting have been placed on paid leave. One of them, Adrian Alaniz, a Pasco native, is Hispanic. The shooting has caused soul-searching among some city officials, who, even as they urge the residents to wait for the results of an investigation, say the protests have uncovered anger bubbling below the surface. “This was about more than just Antonio,” said City Manager Dave Zabell, who took over the job last August. “It’s part of a community emerging,” he continued, “and frankly, it’s welcomed.” Mr. Zambrano-Montes was raised in Michoacán, Mexico. He came to the United States about a decade ago to work in the orchards, said family members, who described him as both caring — guiding newly arrived relatives — and troubled. His wife obtained a protection order against him several years ago, they said, alleging that he had abused her. She, along with their two daughters, eventually moved to California. Mr. Zambrano-Montes was in the country illegally and did not speak English. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He was arrested for assaulting a police officer in January 2014. The police said he had thrown objects at officers and tried to grab an officer’s pistol. He pleaded guilty in June. In recent months he was out of work and appeared increasingly depressed and disoriented, his aunts and cousins said, after falling from a ladder in an apple orchard and breaking both his wrists. Then, in January, he was trapped in a house fire where he was renting a room, which burned his belongings. Video “What I know is that he was alone, that his wife had left him, that he couldn’t see his daughters,” said his cousin Pedro Farias, 32. “I don’t know what his reasons were” for throwing rocks at the police, “but I know all of this affected him.” There are some Hispanics who hold prominent positions in Pasco. Saul Martinez is a council member. Eight of 20 Pasco schools are headed by Latino principals. And the Police Department said that it had worked to recruit Hispanic officers in recent years, recognizing the need to reach the group. An Explorer program is one of several recruitment efforts. Intended to train residents ages 14 to 21 in police practices, it has 15 enrollees, all but two or three of whom are Hispanic, said Capt. Ken Roske.

Community leaders cite several reasons, including apathy, lack of English skills and education, and the fact that many Latinos are not citizens and cannot vote. “There are so many barriers, not only linguistic but psychological, that act like an obstacle,” said Gabriel Portugal, 61, a former vice principal who came to Pasco from Mexico in the 1970s. He is now part of a community group called Consejo Latino, which lobbies the municipality for changes that will help immigrants and their children. The video has been a near constant presence here in recent days, played repeatedly on television news in crowded taco shops and bakeries, each time drawing the gaze of those perched over plates of pupusas or pan dulce. Reyes Juarez, 54, said that she had slept little since viewing it, imagining her own son gunned down each time she shuts her eyes. “It’s like having the badge gives you the right to take the life of a Mexican,” she said. The killing of Mr. Zambrano-Montes has also drawn attention to past accusations of police misconduct. One officer involved in the shooting, Ryan Flanagan, was a defendant in a 2012 lawsuit in which he was accused of using excessive force in 2009 against Maria Davila-Marquez, then 30. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Davila-Marquez was walking to pick up her children from child care after work when Officer Flanagan stopped her, somehow confusing her with a teenage suspect. When she requested an interpreter, he refused, said her lawyer, Vito de la Cruz. Another officer arrived, he said, and Ms. Davila-Marquez’s hands were twisted behind her back and her face was shoved onto the hood of the hot car, causing burns.

Like Rush Limbaugh, many times, I refer to the Washington Times often. I find The Washington Times National Weekly Edition to be well written and right on top of the issues. In fact, The Times has repeatedly scooped all other news sources on major national issues like the Clinton scandals. Perhaps more important, The Washington Times National Weekly Edition reports stories the liberal news media intentionally ignores because it does not fit their version of the news. If you want to stay truly informed and get the facts about what's really happening in the world, I strongly suggest that you read The Washington Times National Weekly Edition.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You can use a jar, ziplock bag, or any sealed container. If you develop symptoms within two weeks of the bite, take the jar with you to the doctor. The doctor can send the tick out for testing. If you want to save a tick for testing, do not squash it, burn it, or put it in alcohol. Simply put it in the container, and leave it until you are ready to test it. Medical testing can be expensive. Even if the tick carries a disease, it does not mean that you have been infected. Attach the tick onto a piece of paper with a sturdy piece of transparent tape, like packing tape. This will keep it contained until you can identify what type of tick it is. Different species are likely to carry certain diseases. If you become sick, this information can help your doctor make a diagnosis. You can bring it to the doctor or you can look up different species of ticks online to identify it yourself. Black-legged ticks are more likely to carry Lyme disease while lone star ticks and dog ticks can give you Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If you do not want to save the tick, kill it with alcohol. Fill a cup or bowl with rubbing alcohol, and dunk the tick inside. Leave it for several minutes. This will likely kill the tick. Just to be safe, you should avoid throwing out a tick in the trash. Instead, wrap it in a piece of toilet paper, and flush it down the toilet. This will ensure that the tick is safely out of your home. Next time you go outside, try to prevent ticks from latching onto you. There are many things you can do to reduce your chance of a tick bite. Apply an insect repellent containing DEET. If you have children, spray the repellent on for them. Use permethrin on all of your clothing and gear. This is usually available at outdoor stores. Check everyone for ticks after coming inside. Pay special attention to their arms, knees, waist, belly button, ears, and hair. Remember to check pets as well! After coming inside, put your clothes in the dryer on high heat for an hour to kill any ticks that might be hiding in your clothing. Light-colored clothing will let you see ticks more easily. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and boots if possible. Tuck these into one another.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The sentence \\"Nikdo do mě nebude strkat ty hnusnej červe\\" is in Czech language. When translated to English, it means \\"No one is going to stick that disgusting worm into me\\". This sentence appears to be an emphatic statement, expressing a strong objection or refusal towards something repugnant or unpleasant (in this context, the metaphorical 'disgusting worm'). It could be a slang or colloquialism in Czech language, thereby carrying a unique cultural context. The specific connotations and the intensity of the sentiment being expressed could depend on that cultural or situational context. In general, idiomatic expressions, metaphors, or slangs when translated literally might not convey the same connotations in the target language (in this case, English) as they do in the source language (in this case, Czech). Thus, to comprehend the nuanced meaning fully, a deeper understanding of the Czech language and culture could be beneficial. Further, the tone of the sentence indicates a strong emotion, like disgust or repulsion, and the use of the future tense ('nebude strkat' translates to 'is not going to stick') suggests an anticipation of an undesirable action, but a firm decision to prevent it from happening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments.

If more atoms become unstable, it could lead to a higher rate of decay or even potentially cause radioactive emissions in the coal. This increased instability might make the coal more hazardous, which could lead to stricter regulations and limitations on coal transport and usage, resulting in less coal arriving at the power station. Furthermore, if the coal becomes more unstable and hazardous, alternative energy sources might become more attractive and economical, leading to a potential shift in energy production. This would also contribute to less coal arriving at the power station."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries.

The paper was founded in 1885 by Axel Danielsson and August Palm, and existed up to 1944 when it changed name to \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" (\\"The Morning Paper\\"). \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" existed up to 1958. - Västra Götaland County is a county or \\"län\\" on the western coast of Sweden. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Axel Danielsson (15 December 1863 30 December 1899) was a Swedish socialist agitator, journalist and writer, born in Värmland. He was a prominent leader of the early Swedish Social Democratic Party. Danielsson retranslated Karl Marx's \\"Communist Manifesto\\" into Swedish in 1886. - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - The Swedish Social Democratic Party, (SAP; literally, \\"Social Democratic Workers' Party of Sweden\\"), contesting elections as the \\"ArbetarepartietSocialdemokraterna\\" ('The Workers' Party The Social Democrats'), usually referred to just as the 'Social Democrats' (\\"Socialdemokraterna\\"); is the oldest and largest political party in Sweden. The current party leader since 2012 is Stefan Löfven; he has also been Prime Minister of Sweden since 2014. - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Karl Johan ( K.

How is \\"17.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the number 17 is said as \\"seitsemäntoista.\\" Finnish, like some other languages, forms numbers by combining words, and in this case, we can break down the word \\"seitsemäntoista\\" into two parts to understand its formation: 1. seitsemän: This translates to the number \\"seven\\" in English. In Finnish, numbers from 0 to 10 have distinct names just like in many other languages. 2. toista: This part comes from the word \\"kymmentä,\\" which means \\"ten\\" in Finnish, combined with the postfix \\"toista\\" that is added to form a number between 11 and 19. In this case, \\"toista\\" means \\"on top of ten\\" or more literally, \\"in the second ten.\\" Putting these two parts together, \\"seitsemäntoista\\" can be understood as \\"seven on top of ten,\\" which translates to the number 17 in English. Finnish belongs to the Uralic language family and has its own unique way of forming and expressing numbers. Just like 17 is \\"seitsemäntoista,\\" other numbers are also formed through unique combinations of words. For example, 21 is \\"kaksikymmentäyksi,\\" which can be translated as \\"two tens and one,\\" and 57 is \\"viisikymmentäseitsemän,\\" which means \\"five tens and seven.\\" This method of forming numbers is consistent throughout the Finnish numeral system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods? , can you please find it? Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.

Please answer the following question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails? - not enough information - to stop eating at night - to attempt to lose weight - to be able to eat more during the day A:","completion":"The most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trials was to attempt to lose weight. The study aimed to examine the effects of restricted night time eating on weight loss, and the participants were likely interested in understanding if this strategy could effectively help them shed some extra kilos. The results showed that by reducing their food intake during the evening hours, they indeed consumed fewer kilojoules and lost weight during the period of restricted eating. The idea of eating less food at night time being sensible for someone trying to lose weight is not completely true, as the total amount of food consumed over days and weeks is more crucial for weight gain or weight loss. However, the study highlighted the benefits of eating less at night in reducing the total quantity of food intake and promoting healthier dietary habits. Also, it's worth mentioning that overeating in the evening can often be connected to unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles. Therefore, even though the advice to eat less at night time may not have strong scientific backing in terms of its direct impact on weight loss, it can still effectively help individuals maintain a balanced diet and develop healthier eating patterns that would ultimately contribute to their weight loss journey. In summary, restricting night time food intake can be beneficial for weight loss, not necessarily because of the time at which the food is consumed, but rather because it generally results in a lower overall food consumption. The participants in the study likely joined the trial to explore this approach to weight loss and to see if it would work for them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. But I can use this background: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. What is an answer for this question: In which sample the momentum would not be conserved, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"In this situation, we need to determine in which sample, A or B, the momentum would not be conserved. To do this, let's first examine the properties of the samples and then discuss the concept of momentum conservation. Sample A contains gas particles. The background information provided states that particles in a gas are constantly colliding with one another and that one assumption we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This means that the total momentum and kinetic energy of the colliding particles before the collision are equal to the total momentum and kinetic energy after the collision. In such cases, no energy is lost in other forms, like light or heat. This assumption is important because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, potentially resulting in a condensation of the substance into a solid form. Sample B does not contain gas particles, meaning it could be composed of either liquid or solid particles. In the case of liquids and solids, the collisions between particles are generally considered to be inelastic. This is because the particles are more likely to experience non-conservative forces during the collision, such as friction or deformation, which can transform kinetic energy into other forms. In an inelastic collision, momentum is still conserved; however, kinetic energy is not. Instead, some kinetic energy is lost from the system or converted to other forms, like heat or deformation energy. Now, let's address the question of which sample would exhibit a lack of conservation of momentum, sample A or sample B. According to the principles discussed above, momentum is conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions. Therefore, both sample A, with gas particles undergoing elastic collisions, and sample B, with either liquid or solid particles undergoing inelastic collisions, would conserve momentum throughout the process. So, in neither sample A nor sample B would the momentum fail to be conserved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star. The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes. Which planet caused more climate change? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Earth I, where the inhabitants released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, caused more climate change compared to Earth II, which focused on protecting the environment from anthropogenic changes. The release of greenhouse gases contributes to global warming, which causes adverse effects on the planet and its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: Information: - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area. - Benedetto Ghirlandaio (14581497) was an Italian (Florentine) painter. His brothers Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525) and Domenico Ghirlandaio (14491494) were both painters, as was his nephew Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (14831561). Benedetto died in Florence on 17 July 1497. - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci. - Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525), also known as David Ghirlandaio and as Davide Bigordi, was an Italian painter and mosaicist, active in his native Florence. - Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449 11 January 1494) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Florence. Ghirlandaio was part of the so-called \\"third generation\\" of the Florentine Renaissance, along with Verrocchio, the Pollaiolo brothers and Sandro Botticelli. Ghirlandaio was the leader of a large and efficient workshop which included his brothers Davide Ghirlandaio and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, his brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi from San Gimignano and later his son Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Among the many apprentices that passed through his workshop, the most famous was Michelangelo. Ghirlandaio's particular talent was his ability to depict contemporary life and portraits of contemporary people within the context of religious narratives. This brought him great popularity and many large commissions. - Giorgio Vasari (30 July 1511 27 June 1574) was an Italian painter, architect, writer, and historian, most famous today for his \\"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\", considered the ideological foundation of art-historical writing. - Filippo Brunelleschi (1377 April 15, 1446) was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture, recognised to be the first modern engineer, planner and sole construction supervisor. He was one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance. He is generally well known for developing a technique for linear perspective in art and for building the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Heavily depending on mirrors and geometry, to \\"reinforce Christian spiritual reality\\", his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century. It also had the most profound and quite unanticipated influence on the rise of modern science. His accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy. Unfortunately, his two original linear perspective panels have been lost. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (or Ghirlandajo) (Florence 14 February 1483 6 June 1561) was an Italian Renaissance painter active mainly in Florence. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio was the son of the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. - Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449 9 April 1492) was an Italian statesman and \\"de facto\\" ruler of the Florentine Republic, who was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Renaissance. Also known as Lorenzo the Magnificent (\\"Lorenzo il Magnifico\\" ) by contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. He is well known for his contribution to the art world by sponsoring artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. His life coincided with the mature phase of Italian Renaissance and his death coincided with the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace that he helped maintain among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence. - The Ospedale degli Innocenti ('Hospital of the Innocents', also known in old Tuscan dialect as the Spedale degli Innocenti) is a historical building in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who received the commission in 1419 from the Arte della Seta. It was originally a children's orphanage. It is regarded as a notable example of early Italian Renaissance architecture. The hospital, which features a nine bay loggia facing the Piazza SS. Annunziata, was built and managed by the \\"Arte della Seta\\" or Silk Guild of Florence. That guild was one of the wealthiest in the city and, like most guilds, took upon itself philanthropic duties. - Bastiano Mainardi (1460 1513) was an Italian painter born in San Gimignano. - Bartolom ( m ) eo di Giovanni , also known as Alunno di Domenico for his relation to his master Domenico Ghirlandaio , was an early Renaissance Italian painter of the Florentine School who was active from about 1488 until his death in 1501 . He studied with and assisted Domenico Ghirlandaio , painting the predella of Ghirlandaio 's Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti , the foundling hospital in Florence , in 1488 . Bartolomeo di Giovanni also worked under the guidance of Sandro Botticelli . This painter should not be confused with either the Italian sculptor and architect , Bartolomeo di Giovanni d'Astore Sinibaldi ( 1469 -- 1535 ) , or with the Italian painter and architect , Bartolommeo di Giovanni Corradini ( active mid- 15th century ) . - Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, known as Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445 May 17, 1510), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later in his \\"Vita\\" of Botticelli as a \\"golden age\\". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Nostradameus was a power metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. They were formed in 1998, and disbanded in 2016. Their latest release is \\"Illusion's Parade\\". - U.D.O. is a German heavy metal band founded by lead singer Udo Dirkschneider in 1987. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - AFM Records GmbH is a music label based in Schwalmstadt, Germany. They focus on the heavy metal musical genre, signing bands such as U.D.O., Doro, Kotipelto, Masterplan, Nostradameus, and Annihilator.

Input: Paragraph: \\"President Donald Trump and top health officials in his administration are now openly at odds over hydroxychloroquine. Both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House task force, have said careful studies show the drug doesn’t speed recovery from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Still, at an Aug. 3 White House event, Trump said he has taken hydroxychloroquine and it is \\"\\"very highly thought of.\\"\\" Trump said the drug is politically toxic because he supports it. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health and overseer of the virus testing effort, said it is time to \\"\\"move on.\\"\\" \\"\\"There have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to Hydroxychloroquine,\\"\\" Giroir said Aug. 2. \\"\\"So, at this point in time, we don't recommend that as a treatment. \\"\\" We asked Giroir’s office to name the five studies he referenced in that interview. Not all of them used placebos, but they all randomly assigned patients to hydroxychloroquine treatment and conventional treatment groups. The drug proved itself in none of them. Before we summarize the studies, a brief word about why this sort of study matters. If you want to know if a drug works, ideally the only difference between a patient who gets it and one who doesn’t is — no surprise — the drug itself. That’s harder to do than meets the eye. People aren’t identical. You can weigh them, look at their medical histories, check their blood oxygen levels and temperature, and yet, you still might miss something. That’s where randomly assigning patients to treatment and non-treatment groups comes in. \\"\\"You don’t know all the possible things going on in the background and all that noise is what randomizing helps filter out,\\"\\" said Boston University infectious disease modeler Brooke Nichols. \\"\\"It’s the best way to be sure that the only effect is the effect of the drug.\\"\\" Letting a computer program assign patients also prevents any subconscious choices by doctors from distorting the results. The whole approach is designed to take human foibles out of the picture. To really minimize the human factor, not only do you randomly assign patients to groups, but the patients and the health care workers themselves don’t know what group they are in. So everyone gets a pill, but for half of them, the pill might be just sugar or something equally neutral. That neutral pill is a placebo. \\"\\"That’s the gold-gold standard of research,\\"\\" said Nichols. \\"\\"And just one one small notch below that is the randomized controlled trial without a placebo.\\"\\" Nichols said that the lack of a placebo takes on more importance when a non-placebo study comes up with different results than one with a placebo. \\"\\"When the results are in agreement, it doesn’t matter as much,\\"\\" Nichols said. Giroir’s office sent us a list of the studies he had in mind. All of them used the randomized control approach. Two of them used placebos, and three did not. They all found the drug ineffective. Here’s Giroir’s list (plus a couple more we found ourselves): A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Prevention of Covid-19 Transmission and Disease, MedRxIV, July 26, 2020. No placebo. This study out of Spain aimed to see if the drug prevented the disease. It involved about 2,300 people who had been exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus. After random assignment, one group got a dose of hydroxychloroquine for a week, and the other didn’t. The differences were small, too small to be statistically significant. In the treatment group, 5.7% caught the virus. In the non-treatment group, 6.2% did. \\"\\"Post-exposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection,\\"\\" the authors wrote. Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, July 23, 2020. No placebo. This study from Brazil assigned 665 patients (504 with testing-confirmed COVID-19) to three groups: standard care, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine alone. \\"\\"Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care,\\"\\" the authors wrote. Hydroxychloroquine in Nonhospitalized Adults With Early COVID-19, Annals of Internal Medicine, July 16, 2020. Placebo used. This study of 491 patients in the United States and Canada used two groups: one receiving hydroxychloroquine and the other a placebo. Participants either tested positive, or had the symptoms of COVID-19 and lived or worked with someone who had tested positive. They could not have had symptoms for more than four days. \\"\\"We hypothesized that starting hydroxychloroquine therapy within the first few days of symptoms could alter the course of COVID-19 by reducing symptom severity and duration and preventing hospitalizations,\\"\\" the authors wrote.

No placebo. This study out of the United Kingdom randomly assigned over 4,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group and a standard care group. Researchers measured the death rate and symptoms after 28 days. Among the treatment group, 25.7% died, compared to 23.5% for the standard care group. That was not statistically different. And there were no \\"\\"beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes.\\"\\" \\"\\"Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs.,\\"\\" the researchers wrote. The data has yet to be released. A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, June 3, 2020. Placebo used. This study focused on hydroxychloroquine as a way to avoid getting the disease. They randomly assigned 821 people with no symptoms — but who had spent time close to a person who tested positive — to a treatment or placebo group. The hydroxychloroquine group was slightly less likely to test positive after two weeks, 11.8% compared to 14.3% in the placebo group, but the numbers were too small to pass statistical muster. We found two other randomized controlled studies in addition to those Grigoir referenced. One out of Spain worked with 293 people with confirmed infections, but who were not hospitalized. There was no placebo. They found that hydroxychloroquine did not cut the risk of hospitalization, or help people recover more quickly. An early study in May in Shanghai, China, assigned 75 COVID-19 patients to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group, and another received typical care. It also found no difference in the speed of recovery. There has been one large study in Detroit that concluded that the drug worked. However, patient data in that study was collected after the fact and there was no randomized control process. Giroir said there were five \\"\\"randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine.\\"\\" He is largely correct. There have been more than five randomized controlled trials that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective, either at preventing people from catching the virus, or helping them recover if they become ill. He exaggerated the number of studies that used placebos — out of his list, two did and three did not. The infectious disease modeler we reached said placebos improve the quality of a study, but the lack of one matters less if the results are in line with placebo-driven trials.\\" Claim: “There have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine.” Output:","completion":"Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health, claimed that there have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine. While it is accurate that there have been more than five randomized controlled trials that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective, Giroir's statement slightly exaggerated the number of studies that used placebos. Out of his list, two trials used placebos and three did not. These trials focused on either preventing people from catching the virus, or helping them recover if they became ill. Despite the discrepancy in the number of placebo trials, the results were consistent in finding hydroxychloroquine ineffective."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],D={key:0},q={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
