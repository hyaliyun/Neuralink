Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. \\"Fragilaria\\"), fans (e.g. \\"Meridion\\"), zigzags (e.g. \\"Tabellaria\\"), or stars (e.g. \\"Asterionella\\"). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial \\"Bacillaria paradoxa\\", was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality. - Trigonella is a genus from the family Fabaceae. The best known member is the herb fenugreek. - Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, \\"tres\\" \\"three\\" + \\"folium\\" \\"leaf\\"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled, cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include \\"Melilotus\\" (sweet clover) and \\"Medicago\\" (alfalfa or Calvary clover). - Alfalfa , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 1020 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine. - Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, NN, to be used in other ways. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the \\"Trifolium\\" clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide. - Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (\\"M. sativa\\"), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, \\"medica\\", from median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (\\"M. arborea\\") is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in \\"Medicago\\" range from 2\\"n\\" = 14 to 48. - Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. \\"Rhizobium\\" species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of legumes and \\"\\". - Medicago falcata is a plant species of the genus Medicago . It is native to the Mediterranean basin , but is found throughout the world . It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which is capable of nitrogen fixation . Its common names include blue alfalfa , sickle alfalfa , sickle medick , yellow lucerne , and yellow - flowered alfalfa . - Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the group of saponin compounds. Triterpenes are a type of terpene containing 30 carbon atoms. Triterpenes are assembled from a five-carbon isoprene unit through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to make a thirty-carbon compound. Some triterpenes are steroidal in nature. Cholesterol, phytosterols and phytoecdysteroids are triterpenes. The triterpenes are subdivided into some 20 groups, depending on their particular structures. Some triterpenoid compounds are found as saponin glycosides which refers to the attachment of various sugar molecules to the triterpene unit. These sugars can be cleaved off in the gut by bacteria, sometimes allowing the aglycone (triterpene) to be absorbed into the bloodstream or to insert into cell membranes. - Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word \\"flavus\\" meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites. - Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. The Fabaceae include legume crops such as beans and peas. - Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium (rhizobium). It forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera \\"Medicago\\", \\"Melilotus\\" and \\"Trigonella\\", including the model legume \\"Medicago truncatula\\". This symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule. The \\"S. meliloti\\" genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases) and two chromids, pSymA (~1.4 megabases) and pSymB (~1.7 megabases). Five \\"S. meliloti\\" genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11 - Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant 1060 cm tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, 12 cm long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod. - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. What is the relationship between 'medicago falcata' and 'medicago sativa'? A:","completion":"Medicago falcata and Medicago sativa are both plant species belonging to the genus Medicago in the family Fabaceae.

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision.

The Inner Harbor is located at the mouth of Jones Falls, creating the wide and short northwest branch of the Patapsco River. The district includes any water west of a line drawn between the foot of President Street and the American Visionary Art Museum. - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district. - A one-way pair, one-way couple, or just couplet is a pair of parallel, usually one-way streets that carry opposite directions of a signed route or major traffic flow, or sometimes opposite directions of a bus or streetcar route. - Jonestown is a neighborhood in the southeastern district of Baltimore .

Well, Louis Braille's work changed the world. Born in a small town near Paris in 1809, shortly after his third birthday Louis blinded himself in one eye while playing with a sharp pointed tool in his father's workshop. He soon lost the sight in his other eye when the infection spread. He wanted to go to school, but in his small town there was no school for him. At that time, blind people did not get any school education. Braille went to Paris to study, but there were few books for the blind. Louis knew that books were the key to learning. He struggled with ideas for three years. Finally, at fifteen, he invented an alphabet made with raised dots . Blind people could \\"read\\" by feeling the patterns of the dots.

Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

Alternatively, have her write about how that person has influenced her. Remind her that the deceased lives on through her. Memory books can help in the grieving process. Compile mementos, photos or stories about the deceased person. This helps one come to terms with the magnitude of the loss and to focus on the realities of one’s new life without forgetting the lost loved one. Place an open chair opposite the grieving person and ask her to imagine the deceased person sitting in that chair. Give the bereaved person the opportunity to speak to the person in the chair and say all the things that she would like to have said to that person. Playing out situations from the past or rehearsing difficult future situations may help bring closure. The use of objects and memorabilia, such as jewelry and other objects which the bereaved person is comfortable with, can be used to facilitate talking and bringing the mourning process to a close. Some people will want to clear their heads or process their loss before trying to commemorate their loved one. Many people have difficulty talking about what has happened. It is your job to give the grieving party ideas about how to move on. It is not your job to force them to do something they do not want to do.

I had a baby here this year and I would never suggest anybody give birth at this hospital. Nurses are rude! I had maybe 1-2 nice nurses. This old lady tried to force kick me out of my room so she can have people clean...ugh I just had a baby dumb dumb. I had random people that werent my nurse coming into my room when I'm breastfeeding my son. They will sometimes use my bathroom area as a kick it spot. So I had to get up out of bed while in pain at least 10 times a day to make sure my door was fully shut so they can't come in. What a pain. Literally. I hAd to also tell all these nurses I've met to close the door behind them because they will leave it open and next thing u know random people is in my room. Dangerous. Even people that aren't employed. The stupid nurse had our paperwork and turned it in having things crossed out without our knowledge and admin won't accept it so now my sons father is not on the birth certificate. Idiot! Little things like that now I have to go correct. I was so drained, tired, and in horrible pain after giving birth I literally couldn't get out of bed fast. Everything was hurting. Then I get this nurse who was trying to force me to go to breastfeeding class after I just told her if it's optional than I'm not going. I read all the breastfeeding things I need to know and etc. I mainly didn't want to go because I couldn't even keep my eyes open. I felt weak and exhausted. She kept forcing me sevetal times after i politely declined every time, but after 20 times trying to make me go i finally stated again to her rudely I'm not going that's the end of it. She backed off. I've been breastfeeding my son for almost a year. I have no problems. Another occasion happened when I took my son in for a circumcision. OMG! After my son went thru surgery, I came back there to calm him down. He was crying hysterically because of course the pain from the surgery. Tell me why this old witch grabs my son from me snd sticks a pedialyte down his throat where his crying was less quiet because the nipple from the bottle was blocking his throat. I told this witch don't be sticking it down his throat to stop him from crying he just came out of surgery. I grabbed my son back and she said he's such a drama queen. Excuse u ugly bitch. That got me mad. My son needed me do much I couldnt curse the bitch out. His crying had me occupied. After taking the bottle out of his mouth his crying was worse! This angers me thinking about it still. A lot of these do called nurses don't dI their job right.

Article: The patterns of 1792 are among the most intriguing stories in the history of U.S. numismatics. Carl Carlson published an extensive article about them in the March 1982 Numismatist. In this lengthy and worthwhile article, he brought together findings from previous researchers who had examined the series, and led in a methodical fashion queries into when the pieces were struck, by whom, and where they were manufactured. The article leaves open several questions, some of which have yet to be resolved. One is the question of which Birch the coin refers to. There are two varieties of Birch cents: The “regular” design has BIRCH on the bust truncation and is represented by 15-20 pieces today (including both Judd-4 and Judd-5). The other design is a unique white metal specimen with GWPt on the reverse, an abbreviation for “George Washington President.” As superficially different as these two coins appear, they are actually different engraving states of the same die. The two designs are punch-linked, indicating the same person engraved both at about the same time. The obverses are closer in treatment, but the reverses show evidence of considerably more drastic die work. The half disme and the Birch cent are definitely related and from the same engraver. The half disme is virtually a mirror image of the Birch cent, with Liberty facing left rather than right as on the cent. Carlson’s article makes a clear case for the time frame of the striking of these coins from a December 1792 letter written by Thomas Jefferson. In this letter he implies there were no cents struck in the Mint itself before December, which leaves production of these coins to sometime before October, when the Mint presses were first operational. This leaves only one possibility for the location of the production of the Birch cents: John Harper’s coach house. The question of just which Birch was actually responsible for these pattern cents has since proven to be not Thomas Birch, previously believed to have engraved the dies. Thomas Birch was born in England in 1779 and was only 13 years old in 1792. It is more likely that William Russell Birch, a famous Philadelphia miniaturist, visited Philadelphia in the spring and summer of 1792, although he only moved his family there in 1794. Carlson lays out the most logical origin of the Birch cent: “Were the original ‘GWPt’ dies engraved in Philadelphia, or were they prepared in England prior to Birch’s departure for America to serve as a sample of his work to show Mint officials and Harper upon his arrival? He would certainly have had the necessary contacts at the various private Mints in England to have cut the original dies there and made some trial strikes in white metal as samples. The punches for the cent … were of British origin and do not appear on any dies over here other than the cent. The revised version of the cent required recutting but not punches.” Questions remain today about the specific origins of the Birch cent. Although we have evidence, we still do not conclusively know: Exactly which Birch was the engraver? Did Birch himself modify the GWPt die? Can these coins be punch-linked to British tokens of the period to identify exactly where the dies were engraved? Nevertheless, the Birch cent shares a prestigious spot in the birth of U.S. coinage, along with the silver center cent, half disme, disme, and Eagle on Globe quarter, all highly interesting and historic issues from the first year the Mint was established. ||||| \\"They are a great store value, and will only be worth more in the future,\\" Lipton said. \\"They are literally Mona Lisas of our coinage.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The patterns of 1792, including the Birch cent, hold a significant place in the history of U.S. numismatics.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). The answer is:","completion":"The digital compact discs (CDs) took over the home entertainment market in the late 1980s, when they outsold analog disc records."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Waves hit the coast - Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment - The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper - Water washes the sediment back A:","completion":"The final step of the process involving waves hitting the coast, having energy that pushes water and sediment, the sediment eroding land like sandpaper, and water washing the sediment back can be described as follows: After the water has washed the sediment back into the ocean, the process now enters a stage called sediment transport and deposition. This is the final step of this coastal process known as coastal erosion and sedimentation. Sediment transport refers to the movement of eroded sediment materials by the action of waves, currents, or other natural agents. In the context of this process, the waves carry the eroded sediment materials back into the ocean, where they are transported along the coast or moved even further offshore depending on the strength of the waves and currents. As the sediment materials are transported, they will eventually be deposited in new locations when the energy of the waves and currents decreases. These locations can be along the same coastline or completely different shores, depending on the distances traveled and available depositional environments, such as beaches, estuaries, or underwater deposits like sandbars. Sediment deposition is a vital part of this process as it contributes to the formation of new landforms, such as sand dunes, barrier islands, and deltas. These depositional landforms not only provide habitats for various plants and animals but also act as a buffer against strong waves, proving stability and protection to the coastline. Throughout this entire process, the coast is continually being reshaped due to the interaction of waves, coastal landforms, and sediment materials. These dynamic changes ensure that coastal environments remain some of the most diverse and fascinating ecosystems on our planet. In summary, the final step of the process is the sediment transport and deposition, resulting in the formation of new landforms and contributing to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of our coastlines. This process helps maintain the ecological and geological balance of these important ecosystems, which are vital for preserving coastal biodiversity and supporting human populations who depend on coastal resources for their livelihoods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cinderella and the Prince are having a picnic to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Meanwhile, at the Tremaine mansion, Cinderella's stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella are bitterly doing Cinderella's old chores. Anastasia wanders off to avoid work and stumbles upon the picnic. When the Fairy Godmother drops her wand, Anastasia takes it to her mother. In the ensuing struggle, Anastasia inadvertently turns the Fairy Godmother into a garden gnome. Lady Tremaine, reveling at yet another chance to ruin Cinderella's life, uses the wand to go back in time to the day the Grand Duke fitted the glass slipper on Cinderella. She uses the wand to expand the slipper so that it can fit Anastasia, and the Grand Duke declares she must be the girl the Prince is looking for. Cinderella arrives on the scene too late, and Lady Tremaine destroys Cinderella's other slipper – the only clue to her identity that she was the girl who danced with the Prince on the night of the ball. Cinderella decides to follow Lady Tremaine and her stepsisters to the palace with Jaq and Gus. At first the Prince claims Anastasia is not the girl he danced with at the ball, but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to alter his memory, and he accepts Anastasia as his bride. Jaq and Gus witness this and inform Cinderella that Lady Tremaine has the Fairy Godmother's wand. Cinderella poses as a maid to get into the Tremaines' room, but she is spotted by Lady Tremaine and captured by the palace guards as an intruder.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved. Morrison resolves to never let that happen, and Donatti hopes so for her sake. Two weeks later, Dick is at a party where he is the only guest...

A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. The extremely rare archive boasts almost 200 posters issued between 1914 and 1916, which hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting. They highlight the increasingly menacing tone used in the run-up to compulsory conscription in 1916 after Britain suffered so many losses on the Western Front. Hidden history: A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. These two posters from 1915 (left) and 1914 (right) hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting. Haul: Arthur Maxted inherited the collection, including this pair from 1915) from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. He kept them in his attic for 30 years and only realised their true value recently. Arthur Maxted inherited the collection from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. Mr Maxted has kept the posters in the loft of his home in Kent for the past 30 years, forgetting all about them, and only realised their true importance recently when he started researching and documenting the collection. Now, 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000. 'The posters were collected by my maternal grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war,' said 72-year-old Mr Maxted. 'It is a mystery as to why he kept hold of them, as they were not of any monetary worth back then. Collection: 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters, such as this one which urged men of all backgrounds to enlist, are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000. Justice: These two posters feature Britannia and urge men to recall the deadly December 1914 raid by the Imperial German navy on Scarborough (left) and the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1198 lives (right) Anger: This poster (left) also recalls the sinking of the Lusitania as well as other wartime atrocities, while a 1917 design sought to remind men that others, including women and children, were doing their bit. 'My aunt passed them on to me about 30 years ago and they spent many years in my loft. 'It was only recently that I started to document them and realised they might be quite valuable.' The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops. They were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. Change: When it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled and recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Mission: The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops, and were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain’s declaration of war against Germany. Many thought the war was an opportunity for adventure with friends - but when it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled. Recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Tragedy: Another poster with its focus on the Scarborough raid, this time showing a damaged home and a little girl left alone to care for a baby. Messages included ‘Why aren’t you in khaki? You’ll be wanted. Enlist at once’, ‘Don’t stand looking at this - go and help!’ and ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’. Others targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. One read: 'To the women of Britain. Some of your men folk are holding back on your account. Won’t you prove your love for your Country by persuading them to go?' Target: Many posters, such as these two from 1915, targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. Appeal: This 1915 poster (left) was also geared towards women, telling them their the safety of their children depended on men going out to fight, while another played on the insecurities of fathers who wanted to make their children proud. By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. The collection, which is only missing eight posters, is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'With an inevitability of war approaching and a shortfall in soldiers, Parliament authorised an increase in the army of half a million men in August 1914. 'As a result the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee was formed to boost the recruiting effort and part of the drive included creating posters which were put up in public places. Positive: The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain¿s declaration of war against Germany. 'Interestingly, the posters show how over time the methods and messages used to recruit men changed. 'Many of the early posters depended on patriotism. 'Early. recruits viewed the war as a great adventure which was not to be. missed, particularly as the general view was that it would all be over. by Christmas 1914. 'Initially. these methods of propaganda provided a steady stream of new recruits. but by November 1914 there was a marked decline in numbers. 'As. it became clear the war was not going to be over as quickly as first. thought, more sophisticated and sinister methods were employed. Output: By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. This poster from 1916 (right), bearing the message 'Forward', was the last printed before forced enlistment was introduced. Collection: Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions with the collection of posters. They are expected to reach £20,000 when they go up for auction on July 9. 'The messages were much more direct and even targeted the wives and children of potential soldiers, such as the now famous ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’ 'This collection is almost complete - it includes every poster issued by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee apart from about eight. 'A collection like this is incredibly rare and serves to remind us of the iconic images used to recruit soldiers for this historic war.' The posters will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9. At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up - many of them as part of 'Pals battalions' from the same workplace, football team or friendship group. However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits. Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service. The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers. Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal. Married men were subject to conscription following the passing of a second Act in May 1916, and in 1918 a further law raised the age limit to 51. Conscripted men were not given a choice of which service, regiment or unit they joined. However, if they expressed a preference to join the Navy then it had first refusal on whether to take him. Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year. Source: www.parliament.uk.

Given the question: Question: What is food that is able to be eaten? Options: - spoiled - necessary to live - edible - supermarket - unhealthy Explain why a human would choose \\"edible\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"edible\\" to answer the question above because it is the best fitting option for describing food that is able to be eaten. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this choice: 1. First, let's analyze each option to see how it relates to food that is able to be eaten. a. Spoiled - This describes food that has gone bad and is not suitable for consumption. b. Necessary to live - While this describes an important attribute of food, it does not directly indicate if it's suitable for eating. c. Edible - This term directly relates to whether something can be eaten or not. d. Supermarket - This is a place where people buy food but does not describe the quality or characteristics of the food itself. e. Unhealthy - This describes a negative attribute of food and its potential impact on health. However, it does not necessarily mean that the food is inedible. 2. Since the question specifically asks for food that is able to be eaten, it is essential to consider which option answers this directly. From the options given, \\"edible\\" fits this description, as it refers to food that is safe and suitable for consumption. 3. The other options have varying degrees of relevance, such as \\"necessary to live\\" and \\"unhealthy,\\" but none of them is as pertinent to the question as \\"edible.\\" 4. Thus, a human will choose \\"edible\\" as the answer to the question because it accurately and precisely addresses the given problem, and none of the other options do so as effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reasoning behind this is that it mentions a man approaching a weight (which could be the \\"large and heavy weight\\" from the initial scenario), and a woman watching from the side (which could be the \\"woman in a suit\\"). Option (a) is incorrect because the scenario is taking place on a college field, while in the original context, the event was described as a professional sports event. The settings are inconsistent.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan, Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source, Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack, Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The Friday after the American holiday of Thanksgiving is called Black Friday. It's said that it's the day that store ledgers move into the black and companies become profitable. On that day, retailers slash prices to get consumers to buy. It is also a time when many Americans start their Christmas shopping. VOA's Elizabeth Lee tells us how the economy may affect consumers on that bargain day. This day should be a shopper's dream. \\"It's just the deals, the sales and everything you can get for a lesser price,\\" said Sandy Thomas, a shopper. But it's a nightmare for others. \\"I think it's crazy. I've done all of my shopping throughout the week so I don't have to go out on Friday,\\" she said. It's called Black Friday, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season in the United States. Every year it's the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Stores open before sunrise and there are deep discounts everywhere you look. Last year a crowd of bargain-hunters killed a Wal-mart worker in a New York suburb. This year, many stores are increasing security while they slash prices. \\"This is a huge time for the retail stores,\\" said Fred Joutz from George Washington University. \\"This is when they begin making their profits for the year.\\" Economics professor Fred Joutz says how Americans spend the weekend after Thanksgiving is a good indication of how consumers feel about the future. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Joutz says Americans are saving more and spending less. Some retailers are attracting consumers by opening on Thanksgiving Day, when shops are traditionally closed. Other stores open their doors anywhere from midnight to four in the morning. And shoppers will be lining up in front of the doors in order to be one of the first ones to walk through and get a big discount. Electronics like flat screen TVs are usually the first items to go. Sandy Thomas says it's an annual family tradition and well worth it. \\"I just save maybe half of what I would have spent on a regular, you know, shopping trip,\\" she... Question: Why are many stores increasing security according to the passage? Options: A: Because there are too many people saving more and spending less.

Premise: Meatballs of minced lamb, usually served with a tomato sauce, are called kofte. Hypothesis: Kofte is a dish of lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce. Step 2: Compare the premise and hypothesis. In the premise, we have the definition of kofte being meatballs made from minced lamb, typically served with a tomato sauce. This suggests that kofte may sometimes be served with tomato sauce, but not always as it says \\"usually\\" and not \\"always.\\" In the hypothesis, it states that kofte is a dish of lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce. This implies that the dish always has a tomato sauce accompanying the lamb meatballs. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis. Although the hypothesis is close to the premise, the hypothesis implies that kofte always has a tomato sauce, while the premise only says that it is \\"usually\\" served with a tomato sauce. This suggests that there might be cases where kofte is served without a tomato sauce. Step 4: Choose the appropriate option. Available options: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 81*y - 82 + 164 = 82 for y, we can follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the constants on the left side of the equation. 81*y - 82 + 164 = 82 Since -82 and 164 are constants, we can add them together: 81*y + (164 - 82) = 82 81*y + 82 = 82 Step 2: Subtract the constant from both sides of the equation. Now, in order to isolate the y term, we need to get rid of the constant on the left side. We can do this by subtracting both sides of the equation by 82: 81*y + 82 - 82 = 82 - 82 81*y = 0 Step 3: Isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by its coefficient. We need to isolate y to find its value. To do this, we should divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 81: 81*y / 81 = 0 / 81 y = 0 The value of y that satisfies the equation 81*y - 82 + 164 = 82 is y = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: When toxic concentrations are reached , there may be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity occurs . Do these two sentences convey the same information? Available options: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(a). no Although these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they do not convey the same information. There are differences in the specific details and sequence of events they present. Let's break down each sentence to understand the differences better. Sentence 1: \\"If maximum concentrations are reached, there may be a delay of one or two days before toxic toxicity occurs.\\" In this sentence, the primary focus is on the maximum concentrations being reached first. It suggests that after maximum concentrations have been reached, toxicity (harmful effects due to the presence of a toxic substance) may not be immediate. There might be a delay of one or two days before the organism or system experiences toxic effects. This sentence highlights the fact that even when the maximum concentration of a toxic substance is present, it may take some time for the toxicity to manifest. Sentence 2: \\"When toxic concentrations are reached, there may be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity occurs.\\" In contrast, the second sentence focuses on toxic concentrations being reached first. Once the toxic concentrations have been reached, it will not immediately result in maximum toxicity (the highest degree of harmful effects caused by the toxic substance) in the organism or system. There could be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity is observed. This sentence emphasizes that reaching toxic concentrations does not instantly lead to the most severe toxic effects but may take some time to develop. In summary, while both sentences discuss the presence of toxic substances and a delay in experiencing their harmful effects, the order of events and their focus are different. Sentence 1 focuses on reaching maximum concentrations first and then waiting for toxicity to occur, while Sentence 2 focuses on reaching toxic concentrations first and then waiting for maximum toxicity to occur. Therefore, the two sentences do not convey the same information, and the answer to this question is (a). no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

Write an article that answers the following question: What country provided reinforcements?","completion":"Title: Uncovering the Country That Provided Reinforcements: A Deep Dive into the World of Military Support Introduction Throughout history, numerous countries have provided reinforcements to their allies and partners in various military endeavors. It is essential to understand the context and motives behind these supportive actions to better grasp international relations and military strategies. In this article, we shall investigate which nation provided reinforcements and the underlying reasons for their commitment to this action. Context and Scenario Given the numerous instances of countries offering military assistance, it is crucial to identify the specific scenario in question that entails reinforcements from one nation to another. Reinforcements can materialize as troop deployments, military hardware supplies, financial backing, or logistical support. These measures heavily depend on the political alignment, nature of conflict, and geographic proximity of the countries involved. Therefore, to provide an accurate response, we shall discuss one of the major recent events where a country extended significant reinforcements - the Russian support to Syria during the ongoing Syrian Civil War. Russia's Intervention in the Syrian Civil War The Syrian Civil War began in 2011, when pro-democracy protests erupted across the country. The government's violent response further ignited the unrest, leading to the formation of various opposition groups and foreign involvement. As a crucial ally of the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad, Russia entered the fray in 2015, providing reinforcements in the form of air support, military advisors, and equipment. Reasons for Russia's Involvement There are several reasons why Russia decided to provide reinforcements to the Syrian government: 1. Strategic Interests: Russia has maintained a naval base in Tartus, Syria, since 1971, which is the only Russian naval base in the Mediterranean region. Securing this base and expanding its military presence in the Middle East was of high importance to Russia as it directly affects its geopolitical ambitions. 2. Counterterrorism Objectives: The presence of the Islamic State (IS) and other extremist factions in Syria posed a severe threat to Russian citizens and national security, given the likelihood of radicalized fighters returning to Russia. By combating terror groups within Syria, Russia sought to limit and eliminate these potential risks. 3. International Influence and Image: Russia's intervention served to strengthen its role in regional and global politics. By supporting Syria, Russia displayed its capacity to project power and influence events beyond its borders. Furthermore, it reaffirmed its commitment to its allies, creating an image of a reliable partner in the international arena. 4. Economic Considerations: Russia's economy heavily relies on energy exports. Given the significant gas and oil reserves present in the region, Russian involvement aimed to secure access to these resources and maintain influence over their distribution. Outcome and Impact of Russia's Reinforcements Russia's support has had a profound impact on the Syrian Civil War. Its military intervention has bolstered the capabilities of Syrian government forces, allowing them to recover territories lost to opposition groups and secure key areas. Moreover, it strengthened the regime's political position, showcased Russia's military prowess, and shifted the balance of power in the conflict. Additionally, Russia's involvement has ensured that any negotiated settlement in Syria would have to involve Moscow's participation, guaranteeing its influence over Syria's future. Lastly, Russia's military maneuvers within the conflict have led to criticism from Western nations, further highlighting the increasing geopolitical rift between Russia and the West. Conclusion In conclusion, while many nations have provided reinforcements throughout history, Russia is the principal country that extended substantial support in the context of the Syrian Civil War. It provided critical military aid to the Syrian government, motivated by protecting strategic interests, combating terrorism, strengthening international influence, and securing access to the region's energy resources. Russia's reinforcements have played an undeniable role in shaping the outcome of the ongoing conflict and ensuring Moscow's place as a major player on the global stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: In March 2003, a second rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia, began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast. Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year, and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month. By July 2003, the rebels had launched an assault on Monrovia. Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement, Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in Nigeria. What is \\"Movement For democracy in Liberia\\"?","completion":"The Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) is a rebel group that was formed in March 2003 during the Second Liberian Civil War. Its primary objective was to challenge the rule of then-President Charles Taylor and bring about democratic change in Liberia, a West African nation that had been plagued by political instability and civil strife for several years. MODEL emerged as the second major insurgent group in Liberia, alongside the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). The group began launching attacks against Taylor's forces from the southeastern regions of the country. Aiming to restore democracy and address human rights abuses in Liberia, MODEL quickly gained momentum and support. Its actions put additional pressure on Charles Taylor's government, which was already facing challenges from LURD. As the conflict intensified, peace talks between the various factions, including the government and rebel groups, commenced in Accra, Ghana in June 2003. In the same month, the Special Court for Sierra Leone indicted Charles Taylor for crimes against humanity, charging him with orchestrating violence, murder, rape, and the use of child soldiers during the Sierra Leone Civil War. These developments further weakened Taylor's position and authority in Liberia. By July 2003, MODEL and LURD rebels had launched a joint assault on Monrovia, Liberia's capital city. Amidst this chaos, a domestic peace movement called Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace played a significant role in advocating for an end to the violence and pressing for Taylor's resignation. The international community likewise put heavy pressure on Taylor to step down. Eventually, Charles Taylor resigned in August 2003, subsequently going into exile in Nigeria. His resignation marked the beginning of the end of the Second Liberian Civil War and paved the way for Liberia's transition to a more democratic and stable political climate, with the establishment of a transitional government and later, successful general elections in 2005."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"What was the amount that the plotters used to fund their attack?Which entities funded these plotters?\\" Answer: \\"Between 400,000 and 500,000. Al Queda funded the plotters\\" Is this answer correct?

Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip. Question: \\"What is picked up by the water?\\" Answer: \\"Stalactites\\" Is this answer correct? Available choices: (a). no. (b). yes....I think the answer is","completion":"(a). no. The answer \\"Stalactites\\" is incorrect because stalactites are mineral deposits that form inside caves as water continues to drip.

Does take mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the verb \\"take\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In the English language, the verb \\"take\\" can have several different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the different meanings of \\"take\\" in them. Sentence 1: \\"Tomorrow the doctor will take the cast off her arm.\\" In this sentence, \\"take\\" is used in the context of removing something from a particular place or position. The doctor is removing the cast from the patient's arm. Here, \\"take\\" denotes an action of separation, detaching, or clearing away an object, specifically the cast, from the patient's arm. This usage of \\"take\\" is often associated with the idea of getting rid of something or ceasing its connection from where it was originally attached. Sentence 2: \\"Can you take this bag, please.\\" In this sentence, \\"take\\" has a different meaning. It is used to request someone to hold, carry, or accept something, in this case, the bag. The speaker is asking someone else to assume responsibility or possession of the bag, either to help them with a task or to transfer ownership temporarily. In this context, the primary focus of \\"take\\" is on the action of acquiring or receiving something from someone else. To summarize, while both sentences use the verb \\"take,\\" they convey different meanings in each context. In Sentence 1, \\"take\\" refers to the action of removing a cast, while in Sentence 2, \\"take\\" means to accept, hold or carry a bag. The versatility of the verb \\"take\\" in the English language allows it to adopt different meanings based on the situation, making it essential to consider the context in which it is used to understand its meaning accurately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The Valencia Cathedral was called Iglesia Mayor in the early days of the Reconquista, then Iglesia de la Seo (Seo is from the Latin sedes, i.e., (archiepiscopal) See), and by virtue of the papal concession of 16 October 1866, it was called the Basilica Metropolitana. It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood. In Gothic times, it seems to have been dedicated to the Holy Saviour; the Cid dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin; King James I of Aragon did likewise, leaving in the main chapel the image of the Blessed Virgin, which he carried with him and is reputed to be the one now preserved in the sacristy. The Moorish mosque, which had been converted into a Christian Church by the conqueror, was deemed unworthy of the title of the cathedral of Valencia, and in 1262 Bishop Andrés de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building, with three naves; these reach only to the choir of the present building. Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the chapter hall, and James I added the tower, called El Miguelete because it was blessed on St. Michael's day in 1418.

Sometimes the mom’s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining. Nothing is worse than the look on a woman’s face when she is looking forward to her first glimpse of her baby only to be told that the baby is not alive. It doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it.

I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water.

Step 2: Analyze Through my research, I have found that the Chicago flag has four red stars, each with six points, positioned between two horizontal blue stripes on a field of white. The stars represent major events and important landmarks in Chicago's history. Step 3: Present The stars on the Chicago flag represent the following: 1. First Star: The first star represents Fort Dearborn, a United States fort built in 1803 along the Chicago River. This star symbolizes the founding and establishment of Chicago as a city. 2. Second Star: The second star stands for the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 that destroyed much of the city. It represents resilience and the rebuilding of the city after the disaster. 3. Third Star: The third star represents the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, an international fair held in Chicago to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World. It symbolizes the city's progress and its role in the international community. 4. Fourth Star: The fourth star symbolizes the Century of Progress Exposition, another important world's fair held in Chicago in 1933-1934 to celebrate the city's centennial. It represents the continued growth and development of Chicago. In summary, the stars on the Chicago flag represent key historical events and landmarks in the city's history: Fort Dearborn, the Great Chicago Fire, the World's Columbian Exposition, and the Century of Progress Exposition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does word \\"hit\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? Where am I going to get my next hit? After three misses she finally got a hit.","completion":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"hit\\" does not carry the same meaning. In each sentence, \\"hit\\" takes on a different connotation based on the context. Let's closely examine these sentences to determine the differences in meaning. 1. Where am I going to get my next hit? In this sentence, \\"hit\\" likely refers to a dose of a drug, such as an illicit substance or legal medication. In this context, a \\"hit\\" implies a desired, satisfying, or pleasurable effect resulting from the drug's consumption. The speaker may be asking where they can obtain their next dose or potentially seeking the next source of pleasure, often implying a sense of dependency or addiction. 2. After three misses, she finally got a hit. In this sentence, \\"hit\\" refers to a successful outcome or accomplishment, often following other failed attempts (\\"misses\\"). Without additional context, it may be challenging to pinpoint the specific activity in question; however, the usage of \\"hit\\" here generally implies a tangible result. For instance, this phrase could pertain to a sports context (e.g., a baseball player successfully hitting a ball), a strategic game (e.g., a board game like Battleship), or even target practice at the shooting range. In summary, although \\"hit\\" appears in both sentences, the word holds distinct meanings in each case: 1. A dose of a drug/pleasurable effect 2. A successful outcome or accomplishment The context within which \\"hit\\" is employed ultimately determines its meaning, demonstrating the importance of context when interpreting language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined. - Dancer in the Dark ( Danish : Danser i mørket ) is a 2000 Danish musical drama film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Icelandic singer Björk , Catherine Deneuve , David Morse , Cara Seymour , Peter Stormare , Siobhan Fallon Hogan , and Joel Grey .

She appeared in films such as \\"Men in Black\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"The Negotiator\\" and \\"Daddy Day Care\\". What is the relationship between 'dancer in the dark' and 'color'? A:","completion":"\\"Dancer in the Dark\\" is a 2000 Danish musical drama film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Icelandic singer Björk, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Cara Seymour, Peter Stormare, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, and Joel Grey. The film is focused on Selma (played by Björk), a Czech immigrant who is slowly losing her eyesight due to a genetic disorder and struggles to save enough money for an operation that could prevent her son from suffering the same fate. In terms of the film's relationship with color, \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" utilizes a distinct visual style to enhance its narrative and evoke emotions. For most of the film, the color palette is deliberately muted, with dark and dull tones dominating the scenes. This choice of color reflects Selma's deteriorating vision and her bleak reality, adding to the film's overall atmosphere of despair and hardship. However, there are moments in the film where Selma escapes her grim reality through her love for musicals and her daydreams. In these moments, which take the form of visually and musically distinct sequences, the color palette shifts to much brighter and more vibrant tones. The use of color in these sequences conveys a sense of optimism, fantasy, and hope, contrasting sharply with the somber tones present in Selma's everyday life. In conclusion, the relationship between \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" and color lies in the way the film effectively employs different color schemes to represent its protagonist's emotional states and highlight the contrast between her harsh reality and her optimistic daydreams. The use of color serves as a crucial narrative device that enhances the story's emotional impact and helps to convey its themes of struggle, sacrifice, and hope."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: what are the reasons for historical change? Would \\"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The reasons for historical change are multifaceted and complex, influenced by a combination of factors such as economic developments, technological innovations, social and cultural shifts, political events, and the actions of individuals. Analyzing and understanding these changes in history is important for gaining insights into the development of societies and the world as a whole. The given statement, \\"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation,\\" highlights the broad and diverse nature of historical inquiry. While this statement accurately reflects the scope of historical studies, it does not directly address the reasons for historical change. However, it can be viewed as a stepping stone to understanding those reasons. Here is a more focused answer regarding the reasons for historical change: Historical change can be attributed to a variety of factors and influences. Some common reasons for historical change include: 1. Economic factors: Changes in trade, industry, and economic systems can lead to significant shifts in the course of history. Examples include the Industrial Revolution and the spread of capitalism. 2. Technological advancements: Innovations in technology can drive historical change by improving communication, transportation, and production methods. The invention of the printing press, for example, facilitated the spread of information and ideas, sparking the Protestant Reformation and the Renaissance. 3. Social and cultural factors: Shifts in social and cultural norms, beliefs, and values can also contribute to historical change. Key examples include the women's rights movement, the civil rights movement, and the LGBTQ+ rights movement. 4. Political events and decisions: The actions of political leaders, the establishment or collapse of governments and empires, and the outcome of wars and conflicts can all lead to changes in the course of history. 5. The actions of individuals: Sometimes the actions of individuals or small groups can produce significant change on a historical scale. For example, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria is credited with sparking World War I. Therefore, while the given statement provides a reasonable introduction to the scope of historical study, a more direct answer on the reasons for historical change might focus on specific factors such as economic developments, technological advancements, social and cultural forces, political events, and individual actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A large rather expensive hotel. Then add to that image a rather drunk and buxom young lady who is lying on the floor in a drunken slumber after taking off a lot of her clothes. She was just in her underwear. We were called to look after her. On our arrival she was absolutely fine. Stood up, walked to the stretcher and lay down. Whining about how we were the ' oppressors of society', and other such drivel Because I had the cheek to try and give her a tiny bit of dignity by covering her up with a blanket. She didn't want that. We made it to the ambulance without any hassle and started to do the necessary checks we do on every patient. Blood pressure etc etc when out of the blue she decided that she wanted to release her rather large breasts. Try as I might to give her a little bit of dignity she wasn't interested so we just made sure no one could see inside the ambulance. After a few minutes she calmed down so I put the blanket over her.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? very very strong","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"very very strong,\\" I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the main words and phrases in the sentence. 2. Determine the sentiment of each word or phrase. 3. Evaluate the overall sentiment of the sentence based on the sentiment scores of the words and phrases. Step 1: Identify the main words and phrases In this sentence, the main words are 'very', which is used twice for emphasis, and 'strong.' Step 2: Determine the sentiment of each word or phrase - 'very': This word is an intensifier and doesn't have a sentiment by itself, but it strengthens the sentiment of the word it's modifying. - 'strong': This word has a positive sentiment. In the context of a movie review, 'strong' often implies that something about the movie (e.g., performance, storyline, visuals) was powerful or impressive.

According to Sahih al-Bukhari, the Quran was recited among Levantines and Iraqis, and discussed by Christians and Jews, before it was standardized. Its language was similar to the Syriac language.[citation needed] The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament. Muslims believe the common elements or resemblances between the Bible and other Jewish and Christian writings and Islamic dispensations is due to their common divine source,[citation needed] and that the original Christian or Jewish texts were authentic divine revelations given to prophets. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who has claimed that Christians and Jews had heard and discussed the Quran before it took on its standardized Arabic form?","completion":"The claim that Christians and Jews had heard and discussed the Quran before it took on its standardized Arabic form is not explicitly found in Sahih al-Bukhari or other primary Islamic sources. However, the Quran does acknowledge the existence of previous scriptures, and Muslims believe that the Jewish and Christian texts, such as the Torah and Gospel, have common origins with the Quran, as they are all believed to come from the same divine source. As for the claim that its language was similar to the Syriac language, it could be based on the research of scholars who have studied the influences and connections between Syriac (Aramaic) and the Arabic language. It is important to recognize that early Islamic history and the emergence of the Quran took place in a multicultural context, where various Semitic languages, including Syriac, were spoken and used for liturgical purposes. The idea that Jewish and Christian communities in the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant were exposed to the Quran before it was standardized may be conceivable due to the interactions and cultural exchanges among these religious communities. However, it is important to note that this claim is not explicitly present in the primary Islamic sources, such as Sahih al-Bukhari. Nonetheless, the Quran does emphasize the shared prophetic history among the Abrahamic religions and features many of the prophets and stories found in the Jewish and Christian texts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about the author?

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack.

Vibrant colors danced among the lush greenery, as she had meticulously selected each plant for its visual appeal. Roses, lilies, and tulips brushed elbows with daffodils, sunflowers, and lavender, creating a spectacle of hues and fragrances that captivated anyone who passed by. Step 1: Assess the current direction of the story Given the focus on the mother's garden and the beautiful plants she has cultivated, the story currently centers on the mother's dedication to her garden and her love of nature. Step 2: Consider potential developments Potential avenues to explore include the impact the garden has on the mother's relationships, challenges the mother might face in tending to her garden, or the garden's influence on others in the community. Step 3: Choose a direction to take the story Focusing on the garden's influence on others in the community allows for exploration of themes such as the power of nature and the importance of nurturing beauty. Step 4: Develop the chosen direction As the mother's garden grew, it soon became more than a personal haven for her and her family. People from around the neighborhood would take detours on their daily commutes just to catch a glimpse of the breathtaking array of flowers, and some would even stop to chat with the mother about her botanical pursuits. One day, a young girl named Lucy approached the garden along with her grandfather. She was taken aback by the dazzling assortment of flora, and the rich scents that enveloped her senses. As they neared, her grandfather noticed the mother working on a particularly delicate vining plant, its tendrils wrapping around the base of a trellis. Step 5: Introduce conflict Introducing a conflict will help to create tension and sustain interest in the story. In this case, a conflict can emerge from the beauty of the garden being threatened by external factors such as environmental issues or changes in the mother's life. Step 6: Develop the conflict As the gardening season progressed, the mother noticed signs of a new threat to her carefully curated domain. A prolonged drought in the region had left many plants thirsty for water, and local resources were being rationed to reserve sufficient water for drinking and essential needs. With each passing day, the mother could see the leaves of her plants wilting and blossoms fading, and she began to worry that her oasis might be doomed. Step 7: Resolve the conflict To resolve the conflict, the mother and the community work together to address the problem and ensure the survival of her garden. In doing so, they enrich their relationships and gain a deeper appreciation for the process of nurturing and preserving beauty. Step 8: Develop the resolution Word of the mother's struggle reached beyond her usual circle of admirers, and neighbors banded together to offer support. People shared tips for water-saving gardening methods, others suggested collecting rainwater during the sparse showers, and some even offered to share their own limited supplies to save the endangered plants. The mother, moved by this outpouring of compassion, vowed to find a sustainable solution to preserve her garden, not only for her own pleasure but for the community that had grown around it. In the end, even Lucy and her grandfather contributed to the garden's salvation, and its lasting beauty served as a lasting testament to the community's collective dedication.

By Associated Press Reporter At least 28 bodies have been recovered from a mass grave in Veracruz, an eastern Mexican state plagued by attacks on migrants and drug cartel violence, officials said Wednesday. The state government said officials found the grave on a ranch outside the town of Tres Valles. It said investigators were still excavating the grave, but did not release any more details.

The gruesome discovery highlights the ongoing issue of widespread violence and organized crime that continues to grip the region, causing anguish and fear among local communities. Amidst this climate of fear and insecurity, countless families have reported their loved ones missing, with some even forming support groups to actively search for their missing family members, urging authorities to take more effective actions against the cartels and protect innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. In recent years, multiple mass graves have been unearthed in the eastern Mexican state, bringing to light the enormity of the challenge faced by law enforcement and the government to dismantle the powerful criminal organizations operating with near impunity. Just last year, 166 skulls were found in a mass grave near the city of Veracruz, in what was considered one of the largest clandestine burial sites in the country. These mass graves serve as a chilling reminder of the human cost of the drug war, which has claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 people since 2006. As the Mexican authorities double down on their efforts to combat the cartels, many communities are increasingly swept up in cycles of violence and retribution fueled by deep-rooted structural issues, including poverty, corruption, and weak governance. This longstanding crisis has left many Mexicans feeling abandoned and disillusioned by the state's inability to protect them, spurring calls for a new approach in tackling organized crime and drug trafficking. Some proposals for alternative strategies include the decriminalization or legalization of certain narcotics, the strengthening of social programs to provide educational and economic opportunities for those at risk of falling into the world of crime, and the creation of more effective witness protection and victim support systems. While such strategies are not without their controversies and challenges, they signal a growing recognition of the need for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to addressing the complex and interconnected issues driving the violence and insecurity in Mexico. Amid this struggle, the discovery of the 28 bodies in Veracruz serves as a somber reminder of the urgency of finding a more effective solution to the ongoing challenge of cartel violence and the relentless price paid by countless innocent lives. Time and again, the mass graves bear witness to the need for concerted action and a renewed commitment to addressing the root causes of this crisis, in order to ensure that the people of Mexico can finally live free from fear and pursue their dreams in safety and dignity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather? ? Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the...

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen .

I read this background article the other day: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.

Summarize the following: Exercising depletes the body of essential nutrients and fluids. In order to make your workout successful, you have to replace these to help your body recover and build muscle. Use the ingredients suggested in this section to put together a high-quality meal that will help you build muscle and avoid affecting your blood sugar. Protein is the essential ingredient for building muscle. While doing your weight training regimen, include proteins in every one of your meals to give your body the building blocks it needs to strengthen your muscles. There are many options for including protein in your diet. Nuts. Any kind of nut is high in protein. You can't go wrong including these in your meals or just snacking on them throughout the day. Beans. Not only do these give you a high dose of protein, but they have a low glycemic index, so they won't affect your blood sugar. If using canned beans, be sure to drain the liquid so you don't overdose on sodium. Fat-free dairy products. Milk and yogurt are great sources of protein. Have a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt for an easy dose of protein. Fish. Salmon, tuna, and herring are usually considered the best options for protein, but any fish will do as well. Make sure you avoid fried fish, however, or you'll consume saturated fats that could be harmful. You need carbohydrates in your diet because without them, your body will use protein for energy. This will divert protein from your muscles and you won't build any mass. Carbohydrates from bleached or enriched products like white bread have a high glycemic index and will raise your blood sugar. Whole wheat products, however, will give you non-enriched carbohydrates. Eat whole wheat bread, pasta, and cereals to give yourself a good serving of carbohydrates. It is a fallacy that we should cut fat out of our diets. While saturated and trans fats should be avoided, mono and polyunsaturated fats are beneficial for your health. They can reduce your cholesterol levels and also help you build muscle. Try some of these foods for good sources of good fats. Avocados. Fish. Salmon and sardines contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Olive oil. Seeds, especially sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds.","completion":"Regular exercise leads to the depletion of essential nutrients and fluids in the body, making it crucial to replace them for successful muscle recovery and growth. A well-rounded meal that helps build muscle and maintains stable blood sugar levels should be rich in protein, carbohydrates, and some healthy fats. Protein is a vital component in muscle building and should be incorporated into every meal during your weight training regimen. There are numerous protein-rich options to choose from, including nuts, beans, fat-free dairy products, and fish. Nuts can be easily integrated into meals or consumed as snacks, while beans provide not only protein but also have a low glycemic index, making them an ideal choice for maintaining blood sugar levels. Fat-free dairy products like milk and yogurt are also convenient sources of protein. Fish, especially salmon, tuna, and herring, contain high amounts of protein, but it's essential to avoid fried fish to minimize the intake of harmful saturated fats. Carbohydrates are necessary in your diet as they provide energy, preventing your body from utilizing protein as a fuel source. Consuming whole wheat products, such as bread, pasta, and cereals, offers non-enriched carbohydrates without causing a drastic increase in blood sugar levels. Contrary to common belief, not all fats need to be eliminated from our diets. While saturated and trans fats should be limited, mono and polyunsaturated fats are beneficial for overall health, cholesterol management, and muscle building. Healthy fat sources include avocados, fish like salmon and sardines (high in omega-3 fatty acids), olive oil, and seeds such as sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds. In summary, to support muscle growth and maintain stable blood sugar levels, it is essential to consume a balanced diet comprising of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Incorporating a variety of nutrient-rich whole foods can aid in efficient muscle recovery and overall well-being during an exercise regimen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences convey the same information about Mercer's familial relationships, but they are structured differently. Sentence 1: Mercer was the brother of George Mercer, John Francis Mercer and father of Charles Fenton Mercer. Sentence 2: Mercer was the brother of George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and father of Charles Fenton Mercer. In both sentences, it is mentioned that Mercer has two brothers, George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and he is also the father of Charles Fenton Mercer. The only difference between the two sentences is the way they are constructed. In Sentence 1, the familial relationships are listed one after the other. There's a mention of being the brother of two siblings, George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and then father of Charles Fenton Mercer. The list is separated by a comma, which might cause confusion to some readers, as it may be interpreted that John Francis Mercer is also a father to Charles Fenton Mercer. However, when interpreting the sentence as a whole, it is understood that all the relationships refer to Mercer. In Sentence 2, the relationships are separated by a conjunction \\"and\\" which makes the meaning of the sentence more clear. The sentence states that Mercer is the brother of two siblings, George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and then uses the conjunction \\"and\\" to state that Mercer is also the father of Charles Fenton Mercer. The use of \\"and\\" aids in clarifying the intended meaning and helps to avoid confusion.

Question: Who was the enemy? Context: Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties— with about one third killed— would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

Following West Virginia's victory over UCF, the head coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers, Rich Rodriguez, began to focus his attention on their next matchup, which was against No. [opponent's rank and team name not provided]. In this context, West Virginia's football team may have been engaged in a series of games over the season. The match against Central Florida was significant as it was an opportunity for both teams to showcase their talents and gain crucial match experience. The game took place in an intense and challenging environment due to the steamy weather conditions in Orlando. This posed a test for the players, as they needed to overcome both physical and mental fatigue in order to secure victory. Coach Rich Rodriguez, who was the head coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers at the time, played a key role in guiding his team to victory. As a college football coach, Rodriguez's responsibilities extended beyond just the technical and physical aspects of the game. He was also responsible for instilling discipline, teamwork, and motivation in his players, as well as helping them develop their skills and grow as athletes. When West Virginia managed to defeat Central Florida, the ordeal didn't end there. Rodriguez had to quickly shift gears and start preparing his team for their next opponent, who was ranked in whatever ranking system was being used at the time. This demonstrates the demands placed on college football coaches, as they constantly need to maintain focus on both short-term and long-term objectives in order to succeed in a highly competitive environment. The next game against the ranked opponent promised to be a more formidable challenge, as facing a highly-ranked team generally means they possess a stronger team with more talented players. In addition, such teams often have significant support from fans, adding to the pressure on opposing teams. This makes it even more essential for coaches like Rodriguez to implement effective strategies and tactics, make sound decisions, and keep his team focused and motivated throughout the entire season. It's worth noting that this particular situation highlights the importance of adaptability and resilience in both individual athletes and team dynamics. Players need to be capable of adjusting to different opponents, environmental conditions, and game situations. Coaches like Rodriguez are instrumental in facilitating this adaptability, while also providing support and guidance for their players as they navigate the challenges of a demanding college football season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Neil but not Kyle was more likely to be prepared in an emergency situation because Pick from: + Neil panicked.. + Kyle panicked..","completion":"Kyle panicked. From this sentence, we can infer a lot about the characteristics, abilities, and personalities of both Neil and Kyle in the face of a challenging situation like an emergency. Let's say, hypothetically, that Neil and Kyle are field operators in a company that often makes them confront unpredictable situations. In such high-stake environments, one’s ability to hold their nerve, think clearly, and act decisively can be the thin line between tragedy and survival. This sentence suggests that Neil was better equipped for such high-pressure situations, probably because of his higher stress tolerance, better crisis management skills, or simply a more composed demeanor under pressure. On the other hand, the sentence indicates that Kyle was more likely to panic in an emergency situation. This could mean that he was less prepared to deal with such circumstances than Neil. Kyle’s reaction to an emergency situation might involve extreme anxiety and excessive worry, making his decision-making process slow and ineffective. Panic is usually a sudden overwhelming fear that can cloud judgement and impede action. When a person panics, they might freeze up, make rash decisions, or simply be unable to make any decision at all. This is likely what happens to Kyle in emergency situations, and it makes him less reliable or capable compared to Neil in these circumstances. This conclusion is based on the information provided. Of course, panicking is a human response, and there are ways Kyle can improve his reactions to emergencies, such as by training, gaining experience, or learning stress management techniques. Overall, the sentence, \\"Neil but not Kyle was more likely to be prepared in an emergency situation because Kyle panicked..\\" suggests that in a dire situation, Neil remains calm and is likely to respond effectively, while Kyle is apt to panic and respond less efficiently. This also implies that Neil’s emergency preparedness makes him a more reliable choice in critical conditions compared to Kyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why dowries are taken in olden days?","completion":"No, the following two questions are not the same. They address two distinct topics related to the customs and practices of the past. Let's briefly analyze each question to understand why they are different. 1. In olden days, how did soldiers manage to fight from dawn to dusk? This question pertains to the military practices of the past, specifically focusing on the endurance and stamina of soldiers in battle. To answer this question, we would have to look at various factors such as training, motivation, tactics, strategies, and the societal norms of combat at the time. In the olden days, soldiers trained rigorously to build strength and stamina, which allowed them to engage in prolonged battle. Military training often involved intense physical activity, martial arts, and weapon handling. Soldiers also needed to be mentally and emotionally prepared to face the hardships of war. This preparation was achieved through discipline, camaraderie, and bonding with fellow soldiers. The motivation to fight was usually rooted in factors like the protection of one's homeland, religious beliefs, or loyalty to a ruler. As a result, soldiers were often driven by a strong sense of purpose and duty, which allowed them to maintain their energy and focus for extended periods. In terms of tactics and strategies, armies would employ a variety of methods to ensure their soldiers could continue fighting for long durations. These methods included the rotation of soldiers on the front lines, utilizing reserves to replace tired or injured personnel, and planning the deployment of forces according to their physical and mental capabilities. 2. Why were dowries taken in olden days? This question deals with the cultural and social practice of dowry, a system through which the bride's family provides financial support to the groom's family during marriage. This topic is unrelated to the military practices and focuses on the social customs and traditions of societies in the past. The dowry system has its roots in various historical, cultural, social, and economic factors. Some possible reasons for the practice of dowry in the olden days include: - Financial security: Dowry helped to provide the receiving family with a financial cushion, ensuring the bride’s ongoing financial security and well-being within her new family. - Property and inheritance: In patriarchal societies, where property and inheritance were usually passed down to male heirs, dowry allowed brides to retain a share of their familial wealth, which they would bring into the marriage. - Social status: A significant dowry could elevate the social standing of both families involved, as it showcased their ability to offer wealth and indicated a favorable alliance between two families. - Gender imbalance: In some societies, the dowry system became prevalent due to a skewed gender ratio, resulting in a decreased number of eligible bachelors for marriage. This scarcity led to increased competition amongst families, who offered larger dowries to secure a suitable groom for their daughters. - Marriage negotiations: Dowry acted as a bargaining tool during marriage negotiations, as it enabled families to secure favorable terms of agreement based on the financial offerings provided by the bride's side. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same because they address different aspects of life in the olden days – one focuses on the military practices and soldiers' stamina, while the other explores the cultural practice of dowry and its historical implications. Both questions require separate investigations into the respective fields of military history and social customs and traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","completion":"To answer this question, we will follow the story step-by-step and identify the correct scenario based on the given instructions. 1. Jackson entered the office. 2. Evelyn entered the office. 3. The spinach is in the red_crate. 4. Evelyn exited the office. 5. Jackson moved the spinach to the red_cupboard. Now, let's analyze the scenarios: Scenario 1: The individual's belief matches reality. Scenario 2: The individual's belief does not match reality. Scenario 3: An individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. In the story, Jackson moves the spinach to the red_cupboard after Evelyn has left the office. Therefore, scenario 2 seems to be the most relevant because Evelyn's belief (the spinach is in the red_crate) does not match reality (the spinach is in the red_cupboard). However, the question asks about Jackson's belief regarding where Evelyn would search for the spinach. This falls under scenario 3. Jackson was present when the spinach was initially in the red_crate, and he moved it to the red_cupboard after Evelyn left the office. As a result, Jackson would logically assume that Evelyn would search for the spinach in its original location, which is the red_crate.

Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near-equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake MichiganHuron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either. - The St. Clair River is a river in central North America which drains Lake Huron into Lake St. Clair, forming part of the international boundary between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan.

It is shared on the east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the west by the state of Michigan in the United States. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. The main inlet is the St. Marys River and the main outlet is the St. Clair. - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada.

The Straits of Mackinac connect two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The straits are wide and deep. Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one, which is called Lake MichiganHuron. Historically, the region around the Straits was known by the native Odawa people as Michilimackinac. - In Canada, an Indian reserve is specified by the Indian Act as a \\"tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\\" - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada.

The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis. - Southwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario, centered on the city of London. It occupies most of a peninsula that is bound on three sides by water: Lake Huron, including Georgian Bay, to the north and northwest; the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River, to the west; and Lake Erie to the south. To the east, on land, Southwestern Ontario is bounded by Central Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe. The region had a population of 2,504,878 in 2011. - Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2011 population of 72,366. It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, which forms the Canada-United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site \\"The Rapids\\" when he had horses and men pull his barque \\"Le Griffon\\" up the almost four-knot current of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679. - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec) were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. - Georgian Bay (French: \\"Baie Georgienne\\") is a large bay of Lake Huron, located entirely within Ontario, Canada. The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. To its northwest is the North Channel. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.

Context: Yes, and I am not proud of it, but grief makes you do some really stupid things. My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Question: Why did the writer's wife leave him? Options: A. not enough information B. The writer was too unpleasant and difficult to love. C.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more gases being emitted would have a direct effect on the process of the greenhouse effect. As more gases are released into the atmosphere from various sources, the concentration of these greenhouse gases increases. This, in turn, leads to a greater ability of the atmosphere to trap heat and energy from the sun's light. Consequently, more heat is retained in the Earth's atmosphere, which amplifies the greenhouse effect and further contributes to global warming. This significant increase in greenhouse gases can have substantial impacts on the Earth's climate, leading to a range of environmental consequences."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - The is a major Japanese railway line of the Japan Railways Group (JR Group) network, connecting and Kbe stations.

It has its headquarters in Kita-ku, Osaka. - A suburb is a residential area or a mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city. In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities.

Natalie hated cats while Lauradidn't so","completion":"every time the two friends met up, a heated debate over the furry creatures was inevitable. Natalie could never understand why Laura was so enamored by the fickle creatures, with their sharp claws and moody attitudes. On the other hand, Laura couldn't comprehend how Natalie could resist their soft fur, clever minds, and beautiful eyes. One sunny afternoon, the two friends decided to go to the local park for a picnic. As they were preparing to find a spot under a large oak tree, Natalie let out a fake gasp and said in a sarcastic tone, \\"Look Laura, there's a stray cat. Aren't you just dying to be its best friend?\\" Step 1: Continue with the current scene. Justification: Continuing the current scene allows for further development of the situation and character relationships. Laura rolled her eyes and chuckled, \\"You know, not all cats are evil. Besides, a stray cat might need help.\\" That moment, the two noticed that the cat had indeed looked quite scruffy and malnourished. Step 2: Introduce a problem regarding the cat. Justification: Presenting a problem adds some depth to the story and can lead to character growth. Though Natalie was reluctant, they both decided to get closer to the cat to see if it needed any assistance. To their surprise, the cat approached them without hesitation and let out a weak meow. Step 3: Show the characters interacting with the problem. Justification: This provides an opportunity for the characters to display their traits and values while advancing the storyline. As Laura fished out some leftover turkey sandwich from their picnic basket, Natalie commented, \\"Fine, we can help it. But, just for today.\\" Watching the cat hungrily devour the food, even Natalie's heart softened a little. Step 4: Indicate character development. Justification: Showing change in a character's attitude adds depth and makes the story more engaging. After feeding the cat, the two friends began to discuss what to do next. Ultimately, they concluded that they couldn't just leave the cat in the park. So, they decided to take it to a nearby animal shelter to give it a chance at a better life. Step 5: Resolve the introduced problem. Justification: Resolving the problem gives the story a sense of closure and progress. Over time, Natalie's experience with the stray cat changed her perspective on cats. Although she still didn't completely understand Laura's love for them, she now hesitated less in supporting her friend when it came to helping feline friends. And while their debates about cats continued, they were no longer heated, but rather filled with playful banter and understanding.

Garden was lacking in nutrients. Once upon a time, in a quaint little town, there stood a beautiful garden, lovingly cared for by Mrs. Winston. This garden had various plants with breathtaking flowers that bloomed year-round, bringing joy and admiration from everyone who passed by. Little did they know that the garden's most beautiful and fascinating story came from a seemingly ordinary rose bush. One day, Mrs. Winston found a delicate rose withering in the garden as the soil seemed to lack the nutrients it desperately needed to survive. With a heavy heart, she dug up the rose and its roots with the utmost care, hoping that maybe it could still be saved. She transplanted the frail rose into a pot, placed it on her windowsill, and provided it with all the love and attention that her other flowers received. To her amazement, the once-withered rose began to grow heartily in the pot, regaining its vigor and sprouting vibrant new buds. It seemed that the pot's soil provided the essential nutrients needed for the rose to thrive, something the garden soil could not accomplish. As the rose continued to flourish, it not only regained its former beauty but even surpassed it. With each blooming season, it seemed to become even more enchanting, captivating the hearts of all who gazed upon it. The once lifeless flower now blossomed with delicate petals, rich with deep shades of red and an intoxicating scent that few could resist. It was a miraculous transformation, a testament to the resilience and determination inherent in nature. The rose's story quickly spread throughout the town, and curious visitors flocked to Mrs. Winston's house to witness firsthand the magical transformation. The splendid rose even earned a nickname from the locals – \\"The Resilient Rose.\\" It became a symbol of hope, strength, and perseverance, inspiring everyone who heard its tale. One day, a renowned botanist named Dr. Claire Horton came to visit the town and heard about \\"The Resilient Rose.\\" Intrigued by the story, she decided to study the rose in an attempt to uncover the secret behind its rejuvenation. After conducting numerous tests and observing the flower closely, she discovered that the pot's soil contained a unique blend of nutrients customarily absent from the garden soils in this region. These nutrients were the critical missing ingredient that allowed the rose to regain its strength and beauty. Dr. Horton proceeded to share her findings with the community, teaching them how to replicate the nurturing environment that the pot provided. Slowly but surely, gardens all around town began to integrate Dr. Horton's discoveries, transforming their soils into rich habitats for roses and many other plants. In turn, the town bloomed with newfound prosperity, becoming a haven for botanical enthusiasts and horticulturalists alike – all thanks to \\"The Resilient Rose\\" and those willing to learn from it. Through the years, \\"The Resilient Rose\\" continued to occupy its cherished spot on Mrs. Winston's windowsill. It grew into a magnificent and inspiring testament to the beauty of nature and the importance of understanding and nurturing the world in which it thrives. And as the town flourished around it, Mrs. Winston couldn't help but feel a deep sense of pride and fulfillment for having brought a once fragile and dying rose back to life, creating a symbol of hope and a lasting legacy that would be remembered for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He managed to download 90GB of “secure files” and customer accounts, although it’s unclear exactly what part of the network infrastructure he accessed. He reportedly developed multiple backdoors and evaded detection up until a raid on his parents’ home exposed a bunch of stolen files and instructions saved in a folder very obviously named “hacky hack hack.” Australian police also seized two laptops, a phone, and hard drive from the teen. He also apparently relied on some sort of software to help him inside, but again, it’s not clear what function this software served. He has pleaded guilty and is due next month for sentencing. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update if we hear back. an obviously named file folder This, of course, isn’t the first time hackers have been drawn to Apple data. Most infamously, hackers accessed multiple celebrities’ iCloud accounts through a phishing campaign that led to the publishing of female victims’ nude photos. It’s possible that this Australian hacker also infiltrated iCloud accounts as opposed to some deep layer of Apple’s network. More recently, the Turkish Crime Factory claimed to have stolen hundreds of millions of iCloud credentials, but ultimately was found to have just recycled already public data.

According to The Age newspaper, the boy’s lawyer told the children’s court in Melbourne on Thursday that his client had hacked into the Apple network on multiple occasions over one year because he admired the company. The boy, who studies in a private school, stored the saved information in a folder titled “hacky hack hack”, the newspaper said. There’s ingenuity behind Apple’s great success. But we must guard against its might | Will Hutton Read more Despite the court being told that the teenager had downloaded 90GB of secure files and accessed customer accounts, Apple – the world’s most valuable company – has denied that customers were affected. The company said it identified the security breach and notified the FBI, which in turn referred the matter to the Australian federal police. “At Apple, we vigilantly protect our networks and have dedicated teams of information security professionals that work to detect and respond to threats,” a company spokesman told Guardian Australia in a statement. “In this case, our teams discovered the unauthorised access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement. We regard the data security of our users as one of our greatest responsibilities and want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised.” The Age said customer data had been accessed, and that the boy managed to obtain customers’ authorised keys – their login access. The AFP searched the teenager’s home last year and seized two computers. The serial numbers of the devices matched those of the devices that had accessed the internal systems, a prosecutor told the court. The boy also shared details of his hacking with members of a WhatsApp group. Apple would not specify to Guardian Australia what information had been accessed by the boy, or how they identified the breach. The boy pleaded guilty and will return to the court for sentencing in September. Dr Suelette Dreyfus, a privacy expert from from the University of Melbourne’s school of computing and information systems, urged against a punitive sentence. “I have researched a number of teen hacker cases internationally,” Dreyfus said. “Almost all these teens grew out of the technology boundary-pushing of their youth, and then went on to live useful lives and contributing to society. Putting them in prison is often a waste of that potential. “Young people often make mistakes when they are exploring and rule-breaking especially online – including boasting about their exploits.

Given the background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. and the situation: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method. Answer the following question: Which farmer didn't cause the predation of the crop itself?

Answer the above question based on the context below: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two Pakistani television networks that transmit from Dubai in United Arab Emirates were ordered off the air Friday at the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and BBC -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. This latest action prevents the two Pakistani networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. \\"","completion":"After weeks of protests and mounting international pressure, President Pervez Musharraf eventually lifts the state of emergency and allows the banned networks, including GEO-TV and ARY Digital, to resume operations. Freed from the restrictions, the media channels return to their regular programming, reporting on the political landscape in Pakistan, including instances of governmental misconduct and abuses of power. While the media channels appreciate their newfound freedom, they know that they must continue to hold the Musharraf government accountable and urge for reforms to prevent a recurrence of the situation. In time, these efforts contribute to political change in Pakistan, and many citizens view this period as a turning point in the country's struggle for press freedom and democracy. Ultimately, Musharraf's regime weakens, making way for a more democratic government that puts protections in place for freedom of the press and vows to prevent a similar crisis from happening again. The story ends as Pakistan moves forward on the road to increased transparency, and press freedom is championed by both the media and the nation's people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was claimed by the United Kingdom and placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1933. It is the largest territory of Antarctica claimed by any nation. In 1961, the Antarctic Treaty came into force. Article 4 deals with territorial claims, and although it does not renounce or diminish any preexisting claims to sovereignty, it also does not prejudice the position of Contracting Parties in their recognition or non-recognition of territorial sovereignty. As a result, only four other states recognise Australia's claim to sovereignty in Antarctica. AAT consists of all the islands and territory south of 60°S and between 45°E and 160°E, except for Adélie Land (136°E to 142°E), which divides the territory into Western AAT (the larger portion) and Eastern AAT. It is bounded by Queen Maud Land in the West and by Ross Dependency in the East. The area is estimated at 5,896,500 km. The territory is inhabited by the staff of research stations. The Australian Antarctic Division administers the area primarily by maintaining three year-round stations (Mawson, Davis and Casey), which support various research projects. The territory is divided into nine districts, which are from West to East: These regions are split into two separate areas geographically, with George V Land and Oates Land lying to the east of the French Territorial claim of Adélie Land, and all other districts lying to its west. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who controls Antarctica? 2. All of Antarctica? 3. How big an area? 4. Since when have they claimed it? 5. Did Autralians conquer it themselves? 6. Do a lot of countries recognize their ownership? 7. How many do? 8. What other countries claim part of Antarctica? 9. What sort of work is done there? 10.

Sentence 2: There are 20 Chaples in the heart of Chalki. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence. While the first sentence provides valuable information about the heart of Chalki and the presence of small Byzantine chapels in the valley, it does not give an exact number of chapels like the second sentence does. The first sentence states that the heart of Chalki has a Venetian tower, which is an important landmark, demonstrating historical significance of the area. It also mentions that the valley area, in general, has a number of small Byzantine chapels. The presence of these chapels could suggest rich cultural influence and history, as well as the religious importance of the area. The use of the phrase \\"a number of\\" implies that there are multiple chapels, but it is not specific enough to determine an exact count. This phrase could mean anywhere between a few chapels to even many dozens, but does not specify \\"20 chapels\\" as stated in the second sentence. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that the first sentence entails the second. In summary, the first sentence provides descriptive information about Chalki's heart and valley, mentioning the existence of a Venetian tower and small Byzantine chapels. However, it does not offer an exact number or specifics about the number of chapels, leaving the reader unaware of the total count. The second sentence claims that there are 20 chapels in the heart of Chalki but this detail is not entailed or supported by the information provided in the first sentence.

Adeline Virginia Woolf (; nee Stephen; 25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941) was an English writer who is considered one of the most important modernist twentieth century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Virginia Stephen was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London. She was the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Stephen, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, had three children from her first marriage, her father Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter, and four children were born in her parents' second marriage, of whom the most well known was the modernist painter, Vanessa Stephen (later Vanessa Bell). Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when Virginia was only 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially, her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother's death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where a number of their mother's family lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother's role in caring for Virginia's mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister. George Duckworth also assumed some of their mother's role, taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa, then Virginia, in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage which resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virgina regarding the conventional expectations of young upper class women \\"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires - say to paint, or to write - could be taken seriously\\". Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \\"room of one's own\\" to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \\"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\\". The death of Stella Duckworth, her pregnant surrogate mother, on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to Virginia's sense of self, and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her mother and Stella as \\"1897-1904 -- the seven unhappy years\\", referring to \\"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should, normally and naturally, have made those years, not perhaps happy but normal and natural\\". In April 1902 their father became ill, and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. Virginia's father's death precipitated a further breakdown. Later, Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a \\"broken chrysalis\\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolf's writing but the \\"broken chrysalis\\" was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief. At his death, Leslie Stephen's net worth was PS15,715 6s. 6d.

Carol, the employee in charge of packing and shipping, carefully selected the more expensive box as she knew its sturdiness would better protect the valuable item being sent to a client. The client had spent a significant amount of money on the piece, and ensuring that it arrived in pristine condition was Carol's top priority. With the box in hand, Carol began the packing process.

Next, she placed the bubble-wrapped item in the heart of the high-quality box, making certain there was even a layer of padding on all sides. While the quality of the box was most important in this situation, Carol decided to save a little bit on costs by opting for the cheaper tape to seal the package. She reasoned that, as long as the box was durable and secure, the tape serving as a seal should be sufficient.

He wanted to talk about Anthony Scaramucci, whose 10-day tenure as White House communications director had just ended in ignominy. Stone said that Scaramucci reminded him of “a suicide bomber,” then switched centuries for his next metaphor. “The administration is like the French Revolution,” Stone said. “You never know who will be beheaded next.” But Stone didn’t believe that Scaramucci would stay far from the president for long. “As you know, none of us are ever really gone. He still has the president’s cellphone, the president’s private number. Just because he’s not in the White House, no one should think his influence has gone.” When I spoke to Scaramucci on Tuesday afternoon, the financier was more interested in justifying his recent past. From the beginning of his time in the Trump White House, way back on July 20, critics said that Scaramucci was too similar to Trump, too eager to be on TV, to last. Scaramucci was keenly aware of that particular liability. It explains why his opening news conference was so filled with compliments for the president. He knew there was only one person watching whose opinion of him mattered. “The president thought I killed it,” Scaramucci told me the following day, still clearly hyped up by his experience in the White House briefing room. The administration is like the French Revolution. You never know who will be beheaded next. Republican strategist Roger Stone “If you were 7 inches taller, I’d be worried,” Trump told Scaramucci, according to someone familiar with the conversation who asked not to be named quoting the president. The euphoria wouldn’t last long. A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine. Scoop: Trump is dining tonight w/Sean Hannnity, Bill Shine (former Fox News executive), & Anthony Scaramucci, per to 2 knowledgeable sources — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) July 26, 2017 Senior White House official tells me that Melania was also at the dinner tonight with Trump, Hannity, Shine, and Scaramucci. — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) July 27, 2017 Scaramucci was livid about the information being passed on to a reporter. For one thing, he said the guest list was incomplete. The tweets didn’t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence, who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner. For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of “The Five” on Fox News. Early the next morning, Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine confirmed that Guilfoyle was there. A source close to Scaramucci tells me that additionally, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the Fox News host, was there. https://t.co/vMz3lVNP5K — Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) July 27, 2017 Scaramucci realized that the inclusion of Guilfoyle would raise suspicion. He said he was aware that some associates and members of the media were gossiping about his friendship with the Fox host and feared this particular connection would only make matters worse. He said he took it as “an attack.” Scaramucci strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Guilfoyle. Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle’s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle “are very close friends but nothing more.” He added, “He is way too short for Kimberly.” Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she’s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are “good friends.” As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night’s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview, published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a “paranoid schizophrenic” and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio. Scaramucci said he felt burned by the interview. “The Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.” Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that. Anthony Scaramucci on The New Yorker interview When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back: “I’ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been ‘old family friends,’ though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that’s what he’s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.” According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing. Scaramucci said he offered to resign before the weekend. The president told him that wouldn’t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to “watch it” in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation. I spoke with Scaramucci on Saturday morning, and he sounded defeated. “I think I have strep,” he said. On top of everything else, the night before, The New York Post had broken the news of his impending divorce from his second wife, Deidre Ball. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci arrives with President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One in Ronkonkoma, New York, on Friday. On Monday, Scaramucci was out of a job. That Scaramucci’s marriage was in trouble was hardly a secret. Long before Ball filed for divorce on July 6, Scaramucci was open with friends and associates about what he believed to be the sorry state of their union and how they were struggling through regular counseling sessions. He just hated that his relationship was being discussed in public. A follow-up report from the Post said that Scaramucci didn’t attend the birth of their son last week. Instead, he sent Ball a short congratulatory text. Scaramucci said this is an unfair characterization of events. He told me that Ball’s due date was Aug. 9, so when he boarded Air Force One to West Virginia last Monday to attend the president’s address at the National Scout Jamboree, he didn’t think he’d be in danger of missing the birth. As soon as she texted him that she was going into labor, he said, he looked into chartering a plane from West Virginia but discovered that there was a wide no fly-zone around Air Force One. He explained that he decided to wait to fly back to Washington with the president, then travel to New York from there. As of Tuesday afternoon, he still hadn’t met his son. Scaramucci claimed that right after the birth Ball texted him her request for some space. When I asked about this text, Ball’s lawyer, Jill Stone, responded: “Any texts of that nature had nothing to do with the baby or seeing the baby.” (Jill Stone said she couldn’t comment on the rest of Scaramucci’s version of events.) When I spoke to Scaramucci on Saturday, he didn’t have much to say about the collapse of his marriage. “It’s fine. I mean, what am I going to do?” He perked up when he started talking about the fantastic team he was going to bring into the White House’s communications shop and the big plans he was going to enact after a tumultuous first week. But on Monday morning, Scaramucci knew he was cooked. Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, the new chief of staff, who insisted that all White House staff report to him, asked for his resignation. “It was a very polite conversation,” Scaramucci says. Scaramucci then went to see Trump, who was unavailable. He ended up speaking with the president, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, separately later in the day by telephone. All were gracious, he said. “The president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship.” So what are you going to do next, I asked him. “I am now going to go dark,” he said. And then? “Then I will reemerge.” He paused. “As me.” ||||| Anthony Scaramucci Moocho Dinero Waiting After D.C. On Public Speaking Circuit Anthony Scaramucci Can Turn White House Debacle into 75k Speaking Engagements EXCLUSIVE Anthony Scaramucci's absurdly brief gig in the White House is going to pay off big-time, and help make the rich man even richer ... IF he chooses to cash in on making speeches. Multiple sources plugged into the public speaking circuit tell us the Mooch is such a hot ticket right now, he could haul in 75,000 per event. We're told his market value as a hedge fund magnate and entrepreneur already made his speaking engagements worth roughly 25-50k -- but those 10 days in the West Wing make him a bigger draw, which means way more dough. Our sources say the high drama around his administration stint adds extra appeal ... especially if he wanted to play the \\"sacrificial lamb.\\" However, it's doubtful Scaramucci would turn on Trump in speeches just to make a buck. He's got plenty of money, and most D.C. insiders agree loyalty to the Prez wasn't his issue. Bottom line -- Mooch is in position to clean up, and -- as they say -- come out smelling like a rose. ||||| I received a call Monday night from Roger Stone, the infamous political prankster and Donald Trump confidant. He wanted to talk about Anthony Scaramucci, whose 10-day tenure as White House communications director had just ended in ignominy. Stone said that Scaramucci reminded him of “a suicide bomber,” then switched centuries for his next metaphor. “The administration is like the French Revolution,” Stone said. “You never know who will be beheaded next.” But Stone didn’t believe that Scaramucci would stay far from the president for long. “As you know, none of us are ever really gone. He still has the president’s cellphone, the president’s private number. Just because he’s not in the White House, no one should think his influence has gone.” When I spoke to Scaramucci on Tuesday afternoon, the financier was more interested in justifying his recent past. From the beginning of his time in the Trump White House, way back on July 20, critics said that Scaramucci was too similar to Trump, too eager to be on TV, to last. Scaramucci was keenly aware of that particular liability. It explains why his opening news conference was so filled with compliments for the president. He knew there was only one person watching whose opinion of him mattered. “The president thought I killed it,” Scaramucci told me the following day, still clearly hyped up by his experience in the White House briefing room. The administration is like the French Revolution. You never know who will be beheaded next. Republican strategist Roger Stone “If you were 7 inches taller, I’d be worried,” Trump told Scaramucci, according to someone familiar with the conversation who asked not to be named quoting the president. The euphoria wouldn’t last long. A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine. Scoop: Trump is dining tonight w/Sean Hannnity, Bill Shine (former Fox News executive), & Anthony Scaramucci, per to 2 knowledgeable sources — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) July 26, 2017 Senior White House official tells me that Melania was also at the dinner tonight with Trump, Hannity, Shine, and Scaramucci. — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) July 27, 2017 Scaramucci was livid about the information being passed on to a reporter. For one thing, he said the guest list was incomplete. The tweets didn’t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence, who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner. For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of “The Five” on Fox News. Early the next morning, Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine confirmed that Guilfoyle was there. A source close to Scaramucci tells me that additionally, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the Fox News host, was there. https://t.co/vMz3lVNP5K — Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) July 27, 2017 Scaramucci realized that the inclusion of Guilfoyle would raise suspicion. He said he was aware that some associates and members of the media were gossiping about his friendship with the Fox host and feared this particular connection would only make matters worse. He said he took it as “an attack.” Scaramucci strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Guilfoyle. Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle’s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle “are very close friends but nothing more.” He added, “He is way too short for Kimberly.” Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she’s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are “good friends.” As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night’s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview, published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a “paranoid schizophrenic” and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio. Scaramucci said he felt burned by the interview. “The Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.” Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that. Anthony Scaramucci on The New Yorker interview When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back: “I’ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been ‘old family friends,’ though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that’s what he’s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.” According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing. Scaramucci said he offered to resign before the weekend. The president told him that wouldn’t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to “watch it” in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation. I spoke with Scaramucci on Saturday morning, and he sounded defeated. “I think I have strep,” he said.

This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I've recently got my copy! Although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'CAPITAL CITY' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of Head Trader Wendy Foley's (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms, interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and, to most people, seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast. In fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old-fashioned senior management of Shane Longman as represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by Wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' Peter Longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy, relaxed modern way of business become a reality. To a certain degree Wendy's (I am led to believe) immediate supervisor Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for Wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground' on most occasions. The main interest in the series, I believe, stems from the simmering romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge's Declan and the cool self-assured blonde haired German trader Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell) which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship/fondness that they undoubted have.

Why are few people born transgender? How are transgender people born? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"At a glance, the two questions may appear to have a similar meaning, but upon closer examination, we can notice a subtle distinction between them. The first question asks why there are only a few people born transgender, while the second question inquires into how transgender people are born. Let's address each question in detail: 1) Why are few people born transgender? The underlying reason only a few people are born transgender primarily lies in the multifaceted nature of gender identity, which is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. The term \\"transgender\\" speaks to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The exact cause of being transgender is not completely understood, and it is thought to involve an interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. Research has shown that several genes play a role in the development of gender identity. Similarly, hormonal factors (especially during prenatal development) are considered vital in shaping one's gender identity. Nonetheless, the prevalence of transgender individuals is subject to the survey methods used to gather data and the societal openness to transgender issues. Up-to-date studies suggest that approximately 0.5% - 1.2% of the population identifies as transgender. It is essential to consider that many transgender individuals may remain unidentified due to factors such as social stigma, discrimination, and lack of awareness or understanding. 2) How are transgender people born? As mentioned earlier, no single cause can sufficiently explain why some people are born transgender. It is typically attributed to a combination of various genetic, hormonal, and environmental components. Here are some factors that experts believe could play a role: - Genetic factors: Studies have found a potential link between specific genes (like those involved in hormone metabolism) and the likelihood of being transgender. It is suggested that genetic predispositions might interact with other factors to impact an individual's gender identity. - Hormonal factors: Hormones such as testosterone and estrogen play a crucial role in the development of fetal sexual characteristics. In some cases, prenatal exposure to atypical hormone levels may affect the fetus's gender identity development. This theory suggests that transgender individuals may experience a mismatch between their assigned sex at birth and their gender identity due to hormonal variations during critical stages of fetal brain development. - Environmental factors: Some experts believe that the environment, both in the womb and during formative years, can influence the development of gender dysphoria (a condition in which there is a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify). These factors may include cultural and societal norms, family dynamics, and individual experiences. In conclusion, while the two questions discussed do address the same subject, they focus on different aspects of the transgender experience. The first question looks into the prevalence of transgender individuals, while the second question seeks to explain the factors involved in the development of transgender identity. Researchers are still working to uncover the various influences that shape gender identity, and our understanding of the subject continues to evolve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: Where can a person buy a snake? Options: - tropical forest - walmart - north america - feild - pet shops Explain why a human would choose \\"pet shops\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"pet shops\\" as the answer to the question of where a person can buy a snake for several reasons: Step 1: Identify the relevant options - In the list of options provided, first, we can recognize that some options are habitats or geographic locations (tropical forest, North America, field) and some are businesses or stores (Walmart, pet shops). Step 2: Assess the likelihood in context - Since we are considering where someone could buy a snake, focus should be on the options that are more relevant to the transaction context. This means that the habitats and geographic locations are less important, as people typically do not 'buy' anything from these places. This leaves us with two choices - Walmart and pet shops. Step 3: Evaluate the options for availability and expertise - Walmart is a general merchandise store that mostly sells household items, groceries, and some electronics. It is highly unlikely that Walmart sells live snakes. On the other hand, pet shops specialize in selling various types of animals, including exotic pets like snakes. Moreover, pet shops are more likely to have knowledgeable staff who can guide buyers on how to properly care for a snake and what to expect throughout the snake's life. Step 4: Make an informed decision - Based on the evaluation, it is clear that \\"pet shops\\" is the most reasonable and appropriate answer to the question. The human chooses \\"pet shops\\" because it is a business that is specialized in selling animals, including snakes, and can also provide expert advice on how to care for them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What do holocaust survivers think of the movie Schindler's list? What do holocaust survivors think of the 1993 movie Schindler's List? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both ask for the opinions of Holocaust survivors on the movie Schindler's List. Now, let's address the main query. Schindler's List, directed by Steven Spielberg in 1993, is a significant film that portrays the brutal reality of the Holocaust during World War II. The movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved over 1,200 Jews from the concentration camps by employing them in his factories. The film has garnered widespread acclaim and has become an important benchmark in Holocaust education. The reaction of Holocaust survivors to the film varies. Some individuals regard it as a powerful and authentic representation of the Holocaust that provides a realistic glimpse into the experiences of those who lived through its horrors. They appreciate the film for its ability to illustrate the complexities of human behavior under extreme circumstances and its efforts to maintain historical accuracy. Some survivors have expressed that the film evoked strong emotions and brought back painful memories, ultimately contributing to keeping the history alive and promoting a better understanding of the Holocaust. However, there are also Holocaust survivors who criticize the movie for various reasons. Some feel that Schindler's List takes certain dramatic liberties, with certain scenes or portrayals overemphasized to create a more engaging narrative. They argue that such embellishments can potentially distort the historical truth and oversimplify the complexities of the Holocaust. Additionally, some survivors feel that the movie focuses too much on the story of one \\"hero\\" (Oskar Schindler), detracting from the broader context and neglecting the millions of lives lost and incredible stories of resistance, resilience, and survival that went untold. In conclusion, Holocaust survivors have a range of opinions about Schindler's List, with some regarding it as an essential and powerful work of art that captures the essence of the Holocaust, while others criticize certain aspects of the film as oversimplified or historically inaccurate. Ultimately, the movie has played a significant role in raising awareness about the Holocaust and promoting discussions about its history, significance, and impact on those who lived through it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but have different characteristics. For example, cell Z is smaller than cell X. Furthermore, scientists studying the two cells have recorded that cell X is more metabolically active than cell Z. Which cell will have more folds throughout the membrane? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, cell X will likely have more folds throughout the membrane. This is because cell X is more metabolically active than cell Z, requiring a larger surface area for efficient transport of materials into and out of the cell. The increased number of membrane folds helps accommodate this requirement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. By saying \\" but they are nothing like their wild cousins\\", the writer means that _ . A) they are no longer feared by other wild animals B) they don't know how to hunt or kill C) a complete change has resulted in the species because of breeding D) to reintroduce them into the wild has become an urgent task Answer:","completion":"B) they don't know how to hunt or kill The writer mentions that the tigers found in the cages of zoos around China \\"have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing.\\" This means that these tigers are not able to care for themselves in the wild, as they have not developed or maintained the necessary instincts and abilities to hunt and kill prey. These captive tigers are \\"nothing like their wild cousins\\" because they lack the essential skills that characterize wild tigers and facilitate their survival in their natural habitat. As a result, efforts to reintroduce these tigers into the wild, such as the program of sending young tigers to South Africa, have become crucial in order to help them regain their hunting and killing instincts and ultimately restore their population in China."},{"prompt":"Title: I hate it Review: The crutch has to button up.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We need to find the value of \\"u\\". Here's the problem: -14*u + 8*u - 18025 = 79*u + 90*u First, let's add the same \\"u\\" parts together on both sides. On the left side, we have -14*u and 8*u: (-14 + 8)*u - 18025 = 79*u + 90*u This simplifies to: -6*u - 18025 = 79*u + 90*u Now let's do the same thing on the right side, adding 79*u and 90*u: -6*u - 18025 = (79 + 90)*u This simplifies to: -6*u - 18025 = 169*u Next, let's get all the \\"u\\" parts on one side and the number parts on the other side. To do that, we can add 6*u to both sides: -6*u + 6*u - 18025 = 169*u + 6*u This simplifies to: -18025 = 175*u Now, to find the value of \\"u\\", we need to get it alone without any numbers next to it. So, let's divide both sides by 175: -18025 / 175 = 175*u / 175 This simplifies to: -103 = u So, the solution to the problem is u = -103.

Additionally, endocrine therapy is the most important treatment in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive advanced breast cancer. This study was aimed to investigate the role of AR in MBC treatment and prognosis and to analyse the relationship between AR and the effect of tamoxifen treatment in MBC patients.', 'AR protein levels and other tumour characteristics (e.g. expression of ER (ESR1), PR (PGR), AR, HER2 (ERBB2) and Ki-67 (MKI67)) in breast cancer tissue from 102 MBC patients were determined using immunohistochemical analysis. Additionally, the relationship between AR status and clinicopathological features was analysed using the χ(2)-test. Association with survival was initially analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for other prognostic indicators.', 'High expression of AR was not correlated with T-stage, histological grade, HER2 status and the status of other sex hormone receptors, but was associated with lymph node metastases (P=0.032).

His marriage is on the brink of collapse, his relationships with his adult children are strained, and he's become disillusioned with the corporate world. As he starts to question the meaning of his life and what he has accomplished, he is approached by a mysterious organization known simply as the \\"Company.\\" Plot: Act 1: The movie opens with Arthur Hamilton waking up to face another monotonous day, entirely void of inspiration and adventure. We see scenes of him at work, surrounded by subordinates who don't respect him, and then at home, where he has a disconnected, cold relationship with his wife and grown children. One evening, while returning home, a shadowy figure hands Arthur a business card with vague contact details of the \\"Company.\\" Intrigued, Arthur connects with the organization and is introduced to the enigmatic Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith reveals that the Company specializes in giving privileged individuals a second chance at life by staging their deaths, providing them new identities, and allowing them to live the lives they've always dreamed of. Skeptical but desperate for change, Arthur eventually agrees to their terms. Act 2: The Company fakes Arthur's death and gives him a new identity as \\"Michael Johnson,\\" a successful painter and world traveler. They provide him with a modern beachfront home, where he enjoys the freedom to indulge in his artistic passions and connect with like-minded people. As Michael, he even meets a local woman named Amelia, with whom he forms a deep and passionate romantic relationship. Over time, however, Arthur starts to feel uneasy about the choices he's made. He misses his grown children and eventually learns that his wife has remarried. The pain of this revelation, coupled with the guilt of leaving his old life behind and lies he has to make to Amelia, begins to trigger deep internal conflict. Act 3: Arthur reaches a breaking point and approaches Mr. Smith, asking to return to his old life. Smith responds that there's no turning back, but offers him one last opportunity for redemption: if he helps the Company complete a critical mission, he will be rewarded with a fresh start and his family's financial security. Arthur reluctantly agrees to the mission and, with the help of Amelia (now fully aware of the Company and Arthur's past life), carries out a dangerous operation to expose corruption within a rival organization. The mission is successful, but tragic consequences ensue when Amelia is killed in the process. In the end, a disillusioned Arthur returns to his old life as a changed man. He begins to rebuild his relationships with his estranged family and find ways to reconnect with the passions he discovered while living as Michael Johnson. Arthur ultimately learns that he doesn't need a secret organization to give him a second chance at life – all he needs is the courage to face his regrets and the determination to change himself for the better. In the final scene, Arthur is shown surreptitiously using the money provided by the Company to set up an art gallery in Amelia's name, as a testament to her love and a symbol of his newfound commitment to living with purpose and passion."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device which he hopes will get rid of pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, creating clean air for the city's mask-wearing people. An electromagnetic field will pull particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. \\"It's like when you have a balloon which has static and your hair goes toward it. Same with the smog,\\" says artist Daan Roosegaarde. His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of tile capital's parks. With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem. Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside. \\"Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low. It lies in a valley so there's not so much wind. It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.\\" \\"We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again.\\" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a practical solution to Beijing's awful air pollution. \\"This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles.\\" However, he hopes the project will make a \\"fundamental statement\\" by allowing the city's people to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.

Justification: The article states that the device created by the Dutch artist and designer, Daan Roosegaarde, aims to remove pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, using an electromagnetic field to pull particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. This device is intended to produce clean air for the people in Beijing.

As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200. - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\" - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners. - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records . - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio albums and one DVD. Their latest album, \\"Incarnate\\", was released on March 11, 2016.

Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \\"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \\"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what else did he propose while serving?","completion":"Ronald Ernest Paul, or Ron Paul, is an important man who has done many jobs in his life. He was a doctor, a writer, and even a member of the United States Congress, which is a group of people who make important decisions for the country. He tried to become the president of the United States three times, but he didn't win. Ron didn't always agree with what the government was doing, especially when it came to how they used money and how they tried to keep the country safe. He was most known for his dislike of the Federal Reserve, which is like a big bank for the government, and how the government collected taxes from people. Over the years, Ron was in Congress a few times: first from 1976 to 1977, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. During his time there, he talked a lot about saving money and making the government smaller. He also didn't like the idea of having to sign up for the military if you didn't want to. Ron did many things while he was in Congress. He started a group called \\"the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education\\" that wanted to teach people about how the government could do better with money. He also started another group called \\"Citizens for a Sound Economy\\" with two other men named Charles and David Koch. They wanted the government to have less control, to lower taxes, and to make fewer rules for people to follow. One thing that Ron proposed while he was in Congress was to have limits on how long people could serve there. He tried to make this a rule a few times, even though he was in Congress for many years himself. In 1984, he decided to leave that job to try and become a senator, which is another important job in the government.

Is \\"These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations.\\" the correct answer? Possible answers: - yes. - no.","completion":"A treaty that is in violation of a peremptory norm, also known as a jus cogens norm, would be considered void and invalid under international law. Peremptory norms represent fundamental values of the international community that are universally accepted as being of the utmost importance, such as the prohibition of genocide, slavery, and aggressive war. Consequently, they hold a higher hierarchical status than ordinary norms of customary international law, and all states must adhere to them without exception. The statement \\"These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations\\" is a correct explanation of peremptory norms. These norms cannot be contracted out of or modified by treaty agreements between states, regardless of the parties' intention or consent. This is because allowing any deviation from or violation of these norms would undermine the values and stability of international law and order. It is important to acknowledge that if a treaty violates a peremptory norm, it will be deemed void and lacking in legal effect from the outset, as specified in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). This provision stipulates that \\"a treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law.\\" Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that the international community plays a critical role in the identification and development of peremptory norms. The formation of these norms depends on the widespread and consistent belief among states that they have a legal obligation to comply due to the significance of the values they represent. Over time, state practice and opinio juris (the belief that such practice is legally required) contribute to the establishment of peremptory norms. Once a norm reaches jus cogens status, it becomes non-derogable and binding on all states, irrespective of their individual consent. In conclusion, a treaty that is in violation of a peremptory norm will be considered void in the realm of international law.

She’s angry over how he’s handling the media circus around her first sit-down interview. Sources tell us Anthony is furious that Baez has been basking in the limelight and rubbing shoulders with top TV talent, but hasn’t nailed down a big interview deal for her. Anthony’s original attorney, Cheney Mason, will take over as her representative to the media, and sources say an announcement is imminent. “Casey doesn’t want to be reading that Jose’s working on all of these deals on her behalf,” a source said, adding that Anthony avidly pores over online reports about herself and her camera-hogging lawyer. “She thinks he’s using her name as a meal ticket,” the source said. Baez has been dangling a 750,000 fee for the first interview with Anthony, who’s been in hiding in Florida. While Anthony finishes her probation, Baez has been making television appearances on her behalf and enjoying the perks of being schmoozed by network bigwigs. “He’s going around taking meetings with TV producers and networks,” a source told us. “She doesn’t trust him anymore.” After the video diary of Casey leaked on the Internet last week, sources tell us her inner circle grew angrier with Baez. “They haven’t been talking for weeks,” our source said. “The video was the last straw.” Baez threatened to sue the perpetrator of the leak in an interview with Geraldo Rivera that aired on Fox News on Sunday, stating that they were private video diaries. Yesterday, it was reported that Anthony told her probation officer that her computer had been hacked and she was upset that the clips were posted on YouTube. Baez and Mason didn’t respond to numerous requests for comment. ||||| Casey Anthony says in her probation report that her computer was recently hacked. The report released by the Florida Department of Corrections on Tuesday says Anthony told her probation officer that her computer had private videos that she had recorded. Video clips surfaced online last week of Anthony talking to a camera in what she described as her video diary. The probation officer describes Anthony as upset that the videos were downloaded from her computer and put on YouTube. Casey Anthony is serving a year of probation at an undisclosed location in Florida on a check fraud charge. The 25-year-old was acquitted last July of killing her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. ||||| By Alexis Tereszcuk – Radar Senior Reporter Casey Anthony’s web videos have caused a renewed interest in the notorious ‘Tot Mom’ and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that a website has offered her an enormous sum for her first post jail sit down interview. Nik Lamas-Richie, founder of the website The Dirty, has offered Casey Anthony a whopping 350,000 for an interview, according to a source close to the situation. While the big four networks have refused to pay Casey for an interview, citing the backlash of groups across the country who are threatening to boycott anyone that gives Casey money for an interview, The Dirty apparently has no qualms about shelling out big bucks for the exclusive get. PHOTOS: Casey Anthony’s Secret Wild Life According to the source, who has seen details of the deal, Casey would be a guest on Nik Richie Radio and the interview would be a one-on-one and would be “pre-recorded” and would be videotaped as well. As RadarOnline.com previously reported, bizarre videos of Casey hit the internet this year where she is showing off her new short blonde hair, a nose ring, and talks about adopting a dog which is “her own.” She does not once mention her little two-year-old daughter Caylee, who tragically died in 2008, and who Casey was acquitted of murdering in July 2011. PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder Casey’s lawyers have cited “security concerns” for their client, and she has been in hiding in Florida where she is serving a year’s probation for a previous check fraud conviction. The offer of 350,000 would be a windfall of cash for Casey, who recently wrote on her probation report that she is unemployed and not generating any income.

Neil had certain advantages and privileges in life that Kyle had never experienced, because Choices: A). Neil had grown up rich.. B). Kyle had grown up rich..","completion":"B). Kyle had grown up rich. Being born into a wealthy family had provided Kyle with many benefits. He had attended the best schools, had access to the finest tutors, and never had to worry about financial stability. While these privileges had certainly made life easier for him in many ways, they also presented their own set of challenges. As a result, Neil's upbringing in a more modest environment often allowed him to approach life and problems differently than Kyle. Neil, on the other hand, had grown up in a middle-class family. He had a close relationship with his parents and siblings, who all understood the value of hard work and perseverance. His parents had taught him to appreciate every opportunity he was given, especially when it came to his education. They had not been able to give Neil everything he wanted, but they had instilled in him the importance of working for what he desired. Step 1: Show the contrast between Neil and Kyle's upbringing. Despite their different backgrounds, Neil and Kyle had become friends in college. They had bonded over their shared love for sports and found that they could learn a lot from one another. Neil taught Kyle how to be more grounded and practical with his decisions, while Kyle shared his perspective on risk-taking and seizing opportunities. Step 2: Establish their friendship and how they contribute to each other's growth. One day, as they walked through the park, Kyle confided in Neil about his recent troubles at the family business. The company had been facing a financial setback, and Kyle's father had tasked him with finding a solution. Feeling overwhelmed, Kyle was unsure how to handle the situation. Step 3: Introduce a conflict that brings their different perspectives into play. Neil listened attentively and then offered some practical advice. He suggested Kyle conduct thorough research into the company's expenses, revenue, and competitors to gain a better understanding of what was causing the financial problems. Furthermore, Neil recommended that Kyle consult with his father and experienced colleagues to gather their insights and devise a plan together. Step 4: Show how Neil's upbringing influences his advice to Kyle. Kyle seemed genuinely appreciative of Neil's guidance, realizing that his initial inclination had been to throw money at the problem in hopes of a quick fix. Instead, he decided to take Neil's advice to heart and work toward a more sustainable and well-informed solution. Step 5: Demonstrate Kyle's growth and their friendship's positive influence. In the end, Kyle was able to devise a strategic plan that addressed the company's financial issues and set it on a path toward long-term stability. His friendship with Neil had not only given him valuable insights into problem-solving but also deepened his appreciation for the struggles that others faced. Neil, in turn, had learned from Kyle that sometimes taking calculated risks can lead to great rewards. The two friends continued to support and learn from one another, often referencing their contrasting upbringings as a source of strength and knowledge. Step 6: Conclude with the positive outcomes of their friendship and how their different backgrounds enriched each other's lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although you may feel that you should only take a little bit of time to mourn the death of an animal, you should also remember that it's okay to take as much time as you need to grieve over your companion. Available choices: 1). Much like mourning, time should also be not everything. Dedicate time to your grieving dog. 2). By mourning a pet, you will be able to feel grief without the need to make the decisions to deal with it. Instead, you can focus your grief on your pet. 3). Give yourself daily or weekly time to mourn the dog and make it part of your schedule. Don't expect your dog to hold you back from grieving. 4). Take a day off from school or work if you need some time work through your feelings. You might tell your supervisor or teacher, \\" my dog died. Answer:","completion":"4). Take a day off from school or work if you need some time work through your feelings. You might tell your supervisor or teacher, \\" my dog died. Explanation: The correct answer is option 4 because it provides practical advice on how to cope with the death of a dog - taking time off. Other options are incorrect because: 1). This option is confusing and does not provide clear advice for a person grieving the death of a dog. 2). This option is also not providing practical advice; it simply states that mourning a pet will allow you to feel grief (which is not really helpful). 3). This option is not ideal because it suggests scheduling your grief, which is not a natural or healthy way to cope with the death of a pet.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"When analyzing these two sentences and their relationship with each other, it's essential to consider the context and specific details mentioned in each statement. Sentence 1: West of Alexandria, civilization gives way to empty desert except along the coast, where the late 1990s saw a building boom. This sentence suggests that civilization is scarce west of Alexandria, as it turns into an empty desert. However, it mentions an exception along the coast, where there was a building boom in the late 1990s. With this information, we can infer that some populated, developed areas exist along the coast west of Alexandria. Sentence 2: There is no civilization in Alexandria. This statement claims that there's no civilization in Alexandria, suggesting that the city is entirely unpopulated and undeveloped. However, the first sentence doesn't provide any details about the state of civilization within the city of Alexandria itself. It only discusses the areas west of the city. Given the information provided in the first sentence, we cannot determine whether the second sentence is true or not. The first sentence doesn't offer any evidence to support or contradict the claim that \\"there is no civilization in Alexandria.\\" It would be necessary to gather more information about the state of civilization within the city of Alexandria to accurately assess the truth of the second statement."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia.

The local sheriff, Poe Jackson, is determined to bring the cunning killer to justice. However, the town's budget cuts have taken a toll on its resources, and Sheriff Poe Jackson must resort to using an old, out-of-shape and seemingly useless horse, named Rusty, as his means of transportation during his pursuit of the ruthless killer. Act I: Introductions and Investigation The movie begins with Sheriff Poe Jackson, a dedicated yet jaded lawman, investigating the latest in a string of grisly murders. As he examines the crime scene, it's clear that the killer leaves no trace, and the evidence is sparse. Poe's commitment to solving the case intensifies when the latest victim is revealed to be a close friend. Frustration mounts as the town's resources are minimal, with the police horses recently sold to manage budget cuts. All that remains is Rusty, an old and seemingly useless horse. Act II: The Unlikely Duo Reluctantly, Sheriff Poe Jackson teams up with Rusty, forming a peculiar crime-fighting duo. As the two embark on their quest to apprehend the killer, they face numerous obstacles – ridicule from the townspeople, Rusty's inability to maintain a reasonable pace and the ever-increasing pressure from the town mayor to solve the case. Meanwhile, the killer successfully eludes capture and continues to leave a trail of carnage in their wake. However, Poe starts to notice patterns in the murders, including the locations and times within which they occur. Slowly but surely, Poe and Rusty develop a strong bond, as Rusty's unique skills come to light, such as an extraordinary sixth sense for detecting danger and an uncanny ability to track the killer's scent. Act III: The Final Showdown With the killer seemingly one step ahead, Poe and Rusty discover the murderer's hideout, an eerie and secluded farm on the town's outskirts. As they approach, Rusty's instincts kick into high gear, and he suddenly becomes a force to be reckoned with. In a tense standoff, the killer tries to escape on a stolen dirt bike, and the stage is set for a thrilling and unconventional chase – Rusty and Poe hot on the killer's trail. Utilizing Rusty's newfound abilities, the two manage to outsmart the killer, ultimately leading to their apprehension. The town's residents, who once ridiculed Rusty, now celebrate him as a hero. The film concludes with Poe placing the handcuffed killer in the backseat of his patrol car, acknowledging that he wouldn't have succeeded in capturing the criminal without Rusty. With newfound respect, a stronger bond, and perhaps a promotion for Poe within the police force, the duo is now prepared to face any challenge that may arise in the future, proving that even the most unlikely of partnerships can lead to great success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The movie begins with Ozzy struggling to make a living as an honest man, but his past keeps catching up to him. One day, Ozzy finds himself entangled with a wealthy business mogul, Clementine Van Hooten (played by Cate Blanchett), who's desperately looking for her missing sister, Eliza. Intrigued by the case and the large reward offered, Ozzy takes on the responsibility of finding Eliza, enlisting the help of his motley crew of former criminal associates-turned-private investigators: 1. Bucky Vermillion (played by Kevin Hart), a nimble and energetic pickpocket turned tech-genius. 2. Rosalinda \\"Rosie\\" Montclair (played by Zoe Saldana), a sophisticated con-woman who now specializes in disguise and social manipulation. 3. Gideon \\"G-Man\\" Sampson (played by Dave Bautista), a man with an incredible strength and combat skills, formerly known as an enforcer in the criminal world, who now provides muscle and intimidation when necessary. As Ozzy and his team dive into the seedy underbelly of Newcrest to gather information on Eliza's disappearance, they soon realize that she was involved in something much bigger than they initially assumed: a potential corporate scandal involving illegal pharmaceutical research. Consequently, they find themselves facing off with a ruthless pharmaceutical company CEO, Sebastian Pierce (played by Tom Hiddleston), and his private security team, led by the formidable and cunning Ariana Hawke (played by Charlize Theron). With their backs against the wall, Ozzy and his team must navigate a labyrinth of lies, corruption, and advanced technological schemes in order to uncover the truth about Eliza's disappearance and bring her back home safely - all while staying one step ahead of Pierce's security forces. Throughout their journey, the team encounters various colorful characters and experiences a series of high-octane adventures - from an improbable car chase through the busy streets of Newcrest, to infiltrating a high-society masquerade ball, to clashing with a mysterious cult led by a charismatic figure known only as \\"The Alchemist\\" (played by Sir Ian McKellen). As Ozzy and his crew become increasingly more entrenched in the web of corporate deception, they begin to question their own morality, the nature of redemption, and the value of their newfound camaraderie. In their pursuit of the truth, they're forced to confront their own complicated pasts while navigating an unpredictable world driven by the overwhelming influence of wealth and power. In a grand finale filled with surprises, revelations, and clever teamwork, the team finally locates and rescues Eliza (played by Emma Stone), as well as manages to save a group of innocent victims caught in the crossfire of Pierce's nefarious experiments.

A study found that about 41 million American workers got less than six hours of sleep every night. Scientists worry that parents are passing their bad sleeping habits down to their children. In the study, Reut Gruber and some other scientists either added or reduced on hour of sleep for healthy children aged 7 to 11. They watched the children for five nights. They wanted to know if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior. Before the study began, students were asked to sleep the same amount of hours as usual. Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. \\"In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy.

About 41 million American workers were found to get less than six hours of sleep every night, and the scientists expressed concern that parents may be passing down their poor sleeping habits to their children. This concern directly correlates to choice D, parents' bad sleeping habits, as a potential cause for children not getting enough sleep.

They were more likely to feel sad and had difficulties paying attention.

While other factors like too much homework (A), pressure from parents (B), and TV and computer games (C) may also contribute to a child's sleep deprivation, the study mentioned in the question specifically focuses on parents' bad sleeping habits being passed down to their children as the cause of concern.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). and the situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What classification of climate is an oceanic climate?\\" Context: \\"As with the rest of the UK, Southampton experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). Its southerly, low lying and sheltered location ensures it is among the warmer, sunnier cities in the UK. It has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at 35.6 °C (96.1 °F) since 1976.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"An oceanic climate, according to the Köppen Climate Classification system, is termed as Cfb. The term Cfb is derived from three letters C, f, and b, elaborating the major climatic conditions of the region. Let's break down what each symbol represents: 'C' represents the group of climates termed 'temperate climates'. These are regions where the average temperature of the coldest month falls between -3°C (26.6°F) and 18°C (64.4°F). The second letter, 'f', stands for 'fully humid.' In other words, these are regions that receive significant precipitation in all seasons including the warmest one and there is no dry season. Lastly, the 'b' denotes 'warm summer', implying that the average temperature of the warmest month is below 22°C (71.6°F) but at least four months have average temperatures above 10°C (50 °F). Now, applying these interpretations to the city of Southampton mentioned in the context, its low-lying and southerly location aided by sheltered geographical status leads it to be among the sunnier, warmer cities in the UK. Still, it fits into this temperate, fully humid climate with a warm summer, given the mentioned climatic characteristics. Moreover, the oceanic climate would also explain the record held by the city for the highest temperature in the UK for the month of June since 1976, a warm but not excessively hot 35.6°C (96.1°F). This falls under the 'warm summer' categorisation without breaching into the hot summer category where the hottest month would average above 22°C (71.6°F). Worth noticing is that such climates are common in the UK, reflecting the overall influence of the Atlantic Ocean. Cities and regions with an oceanic climate are generally characterized by moderate temperature variations between seasons compared to areas with continental climates which have a larger range in temperatures. Oceanic climates can also be associated with frequent cloudy or overcast conditions, and high levels of precipitation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An initial program to study and harness their potential powers and scientific applications soon escalates into an all-out genocide. Shortly after the \\"Purge\\" begins, Selene and Michael are captured by humans. Due to her enhanced vampiric traits, she is imprisoned in cryogenic suspension. After being frozen for 12 years, during which time both species have been hunted to the brink of extinction, Selene manages to escape.

Passage:Born in the Christchurch suburb of Fendalton on 19 October 1925, Gould came from a well-connected Canterbury family. His father was Derrick William Joseph Gould, a prominent businessman, racehorse owner and captain of the New Zealand polo team, and his mother was Elisabeth Mary Gould (nėe Elworthy). His paternal grandfather was George Gould, whose father, also called George Gould, was one of the founders in 1851 of the financial agents Gould Beaumont and Company that in 1919 amalgamated with two other firms to become Pyne Gould Guinness, one of New Zealand's largest stock and station agents. Other notable relatives on his father's side of the family include his father's cousin, the historian George Macdonald, and former British Labour MP Bryan Gould, who is a descendant of the elder George Gould. David's mother was a granddaughter of both Churchill Julius, the first Anglican Archbishop of New Zealand, and Edward Elworthy, an important landowner in South Canterbury. She was thus a first cousin of Charles Elworthy, Baron Elworthy, and niece of Sir George Julius and Awdry Julius. Solution:","completion":"a.

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Answer:","completion":"May Pang"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - LAUNCH Media is a Santa Monica - based media company that created LAUNCH.com , an online music site , and Launch , a magazine issued both in print and as a CD - ROM disk magazine .

The ban of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes is a way the government tries to fight against \\"black money.\\" Black money is the money people make through illegal activities or don't pay taxes on. By banning these notes, the government forces everyone to exchange their old notes for new ones. During this exchange, people with lots of black money might get caught, and the government can collect more taxes. The effect of destroying notes, including both white money (legal money) and black money, can cause problems for people since they need money for their daily activities. The government would replace them with new notes to help those with white money continue their normal life. 2. Micromax Vdeo 2 is a smartphone made by a company called Micromax.

TSA Spends Millions on Body Scanners, Sparking Competition Among Suppliers Despite the firestorm of controversy over the use of high-tech body scanners at airports, the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Transportation Security Administration is spending or looking to spend on them makes it unlikely that they'll be getting shelved anytime soon. Each scanner costs about 130,000 to 170,000, the agency said, and President Obama's budget request for this year calls for 88 million to buy and install 500 new scanners. The TSA already has already spent 80 million on body scanners, including 73 million received in stimulus funds. Needless to say, the technology is big business, and the two companies that supply the scanners to the TSA, L-3 Communications and Rapiscan Systems, have a record of using high-powered political operatives and lobbyists to influence lawmakers. A number of other companies also are vying for future government contracts. \\"TSA competitively bids technologies and makes selections through a comprehensive research, testing, and deployment process,\\" the agency said in a written statement. \\"Technologies must meet detection standards and TSA tests these technologies in both laboratory and field environments.\\" \\"As companies develop new and emerging technologies, they can be included in the competitive process,\\" the agency said. L-3 Communications, which has sold 39.7 million worth of machines to the TSA, has spent 4.3 million on lobbying the federal government thus far this year, though it is not clear how much of that money was spent on lobbying the TSA. Among the key figures lobbying on L-3's behalf is Linda Daschle, wife of former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat. Rapiscan, which has sold 41.2 million worth of body scanners to the TSA, has spent 221,500 on lobbying the federal government. Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff worked briefly last year as a consultant for Rapiscan, but the company said the work was unrelated to the federal government. \\"Mr. Chertoff and his staff of experts provided Rapiscan with advice and analysis with respect to a limited set of well-defined subjects unrelated to aviation security,\\" Peter Kant, executive vice president of the company, said in a written statement. \\"Chertoff Group's activities in that engagement were advisory, and neither Mr. Chertoff nor his staff has ever represented Rapiscan in any communication with the U.S. government.\\" An official with L-3 Communications told FoxNews.com that the company reported nearly 16 billion in revenues in 2009 and that most of its lobbying money is spent on defense and service branches. The official said that any company certified to sell body scanners to TSA goes through a two-year process of having the machines tested in a laboratory and a pilot program before they are accepted. L-3 Communications began its contract with TSA nearly a year ago. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying expenditures on Capitol Hill, said it's common for these companies that have or hope to have contracts with the government to invest in lobbying that can lead to \\"make or break moments.\\" \\"In this case, 4.3 million is an enormous amount of money but a small price to pay for the potential profits they could reap,\\" she said, adding that without the money, companies may not be able to make their case \\"forcefully enough.\\" \\"From our perspective, we want to put a spotlight on the money,\\" she said. \\"It's big bucks, big business. Where it has an impact on policy decisions, we need public oversight. We need the public to take the time to understand the players involved, the money involved and what the outcome is involved.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

The Egyptian Archaeological Mission working at... (Associated Press) SAQQARA, Egypt (AP) — Egypt on Saturday announced the discovery of a private tomb belonging to a senior official from the 5th dynasty of the pharaohs, which ruled roughly 4,400 years ago. Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani announced the find at the site of the tomb in Saqqara, just west of Cairo, which is also home to the famed Step Pyramid. He said drawings on the tomb's walls were \\"exceptionally well-preserved.\\" The drawings depicted the official and his family, he added. The tomb also contained a total of 45 statues carved in rock. Again, they depict the official and his family. In recent years, Egypt has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats in the hope of attracting more tourists to the country. The vital tourism sector has suffered from the years of political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. ||||| A 4,400-year-old tomb constructed for a \\"divine inspector\\" named \\"Wahtye\\" and holding at least 55 statues has been discovered at Saqqara in Egypt, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced this morning (Dec 15). The tomb is \\"exceptionally well preserved and [colorful] with sculptures inside,\\" Egyptian antiquities minister Khaled El-Enany said at the press conference. Beneath the tomb, archaeologists found five hidden shafts, one of which, they said, could hold Wahtye's sarcophagus. Wahtye was a high-ranking priest who carried the title of divine inspector, said Mostafa Waziri, the general secretary of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities who led the Egyptian team that discovered the tomb. Wahtye worked for a pharaoh named Neferirkare (reign ca. 2446–2438 B.C.), Waziri said. [See Photos of the Divine Inspector's Tomb at Saqqara] Neferirkare's pyramid is about 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) north of Saqqara at a site called Abusir. The tomb contains two levels with 24 statues on the upper level and 31 statues on the lower level, Waziri said. Most, if not all, of the statues, show humans or deities, with some appearing life-size and others appearing to be less than about 3 feet (1 meter) tall. The hieroglyphs discovered in the tomb often mention Wahtye's mother \\"Merit Meen,\\" a name that means \\"the lover of the god Min, the god of fertility in ancient times,\\" Waziri said. The hieroglyphs also mention Wahtye's wife \\"Nin Winit Ptah,\\" a name that means \\"the greatest of the god Ptah,\\" Waziri said. Ptah was a creator god associated with Memphis, an ancient Egyptian capital near Saqqara. This painting found in the tomb also appears to show Wahtye and his wife Nin Winit Ptah Credit: Photo courtesy Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities The tomb also contains numerous paintings, their colors still preserved despite the passage of millennia of time. The paintings show Egyptians engaged in a variety of activities, including cooking, drinking and construction work. [Photos: Ancient Egyptian General's Tomb Discovered in Saqqara] The team will start excavating the five shafts on Dec. 17, said Waziri, adding that he believes one of the shafts will lead to the sarcophagus of Wahtye and artifacts buried with him. Several other discoveries have been made this year at Saqqara. They include a 3,300-year-old tomb of a high general, a burial ground containing a 2,500-year-old mummy wearing a silver face mask gilded with gold and a tomb complex that has over 100 cat statues. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| SAQQARA, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt unveiled a well-preserved 4,400-year-old tomb decorated with hieroglyphs and statues south of Cairo on Saturday, and officials expect more discoveries when archaeologists excavate the site further in coming months. The tomb was found in a buried ridge at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara. It was untouched and unlooted, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site. He described the find as “one of a kind in the last decades”. The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside, Waziri said. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside, but the other four were sealed. They are expecting to make discoveries when they excavate those shafts starting on Sunday, he said. He was hopeful about one shaft in particular. “I can imagine that all of the objects can be found in this area,” he said, pointing at one of the sealed shafts. “This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb.” The tomb is 10 metres (33 ft) long, three metres (9.8 ft) wide and just under three metres high, Waziri said. The walls are decorated with hieroglyphs and statues of pharaohs. Waziri said the tomb was unique because of the statues and its near perfect condition. “The colour is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old,” he said. The tomb lies in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered. Waziri said he expects more discoveries to be made there when archaeologists start more excavation work in January. The Fifth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about 2,500 BC to 2,350 BC, not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built. Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.

Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries this year.

Egyptian officials made the announcement Saturday at the site of the discovery in Saqqara, outside of Cairo, according to multiple media reports. Photographs of the tomb show a narrow doorway leading to a rectangular room, its walls covered with carved symbols, images and human forms. Particularly striking are their well-preserved colors – light yellows, rich blues and a reddish-brown skin tone. \\"The color is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old,\\" said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, according to Reuters. He told reporters the find was \\"one of a kind in the last decades.\\" Enlarge this image toggle caption KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images This rediscovered site is part of a massive complex that has proven invaluable to historians and researchers, as described by the magazine Archaeology: \\"Thousands of tombs are spread across an area nearly four miles long and nearly a mile wide, and covering more than 3,000 years of complex Egyptian history. ... Saqqara has yielded some of antiquity's most compelling art and architecture, from the magnificent complex of Djoser, which set the standard for future pharaonic tombs, to intimate, carved stone friezes picturing some of the most moving scenes of daily life in ancient Egypt.\\" The tomb uncovered this week dates from the reign of Fifth Dynasty Egyptian King Neferirkare Kakair, Reuters reports. The news site Egypt Today reports that the site honors Wahtye, a purification priest. It also details the collection of domestic moments carved into the walls \\"featuring Wahtye ... and his family, in addition to scenes depicting the manufacturing of pottery and wine, making religious offering, musical performances, boats sailing, the manufacturing of the funerary furniture, and hunting.\\" Enlarge this image toggle caption KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images As NPR's Sasha Ingber has reported, Egyptian discoveries such as the one announced Saturday are both an archaeological achievement and a public relations coup – new finds can attract visitors to the country, still recovering from a slowdown in tourism caused by political unrest. Another Fifth Dynasty tomb, one that belonged to Hetpet, a priestess to the goddess of fertility Hathor, was revealed in February. And last month, Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of 100 wooden feline statues and dozens of mummified cats. This latest tomb was uncovered on Thursday, Reuters reports, and still contains a number of sealed shafts that could lead to sarcophagi or other archaeological treasures.

A: Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"Yes, the offerings at the Muthappan Temple, located in Kerala, India, do take on a unique form. Unlike the traditional Hindu offerings of fruits, flowers, or sweets, the offerings at this temple are indeed distinctive - bronze dog figurines. The Muthappan Temple is dedicated to Lord Muthappan, a Hindu deity local to Kerala, portrayed as a hunter. According to popular folklore and legends associated with the temple, Lord Muthappan has two canine companions that assist him during his hunts. These dogs are considered to be the Lord's companions or aide in his hunting endeavours, which signifies Lord Muthappan's deep connection to nature. As a result, dogs have become symbols of Lord Muthappan and are regarded with immense respect and endearment in the shrine. Devotees who come to worship at the Muthappan Temple, therefore, bring bronze dog figurines as offerings as a sign of reverence towards the deity and his canine companions. These figurines also serve as an emblem of the devotees' faith and loyalty, much like the loyalty symbolized by dogs. In this way, the bronze dog figurines, which are considered an unusual offering as compared to other Hindu temples, add to the unique attribution to the Muthappan Temple. Moreover, within the temple premises, one can often see real dogs roaming freely. They are well-taken care of by temple authorities, reflecting the communal role in respecting and protecting nature and animals, as epitomized by Lord Muthappan's lore. Thus, the practice of presenting bronze dog figurines as offerings at the Muthappan Temple is deeply ingrained with the mythology of the deity, the regional culture, and the community's collective sense of reverence towards nature and animals. In conclusion, the question is correctly answered – the offerings at Muthappan Temple shrine are in the form of bronze dog figurines. Along with this, it is crucial to understand the cultural and religious significance that these figurines represent, which is unique to the Muthappan Temple and its devotees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again? Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157.

Luckily, it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema, especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television, and the bad evolution of most direct cinema. Really, at first, we must say that this isn't really direct cinema, it is more cinema verité. The difference between the two is very slight, but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary, we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers, and they do interact with the characters filmed. This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation. The Meysels have been allowed in the house, and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed. It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews. Here, we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house, a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith. Their house is a mess, litter and animals everywhere, faded colors and furniture all over the house, and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality. These two people have lived with each other their whole life, and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention, but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way. They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. In the end, though, even as they blame each other for their lives, they really love each other deeply. Edie says she doesn't want her mother to die, because she loves her very much, and Edith says that she doesn't want Edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone. But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age, the two women can't help be girls. They cannot help being one the singer, the other the dancer. Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera. When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically \\"Where have you been all my life?\\" she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills. A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again, the way only the Meysels and few others could do.

Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now.

News article: Google's I/O Is a Bit Like DisneyLand, and a Bit Like a Garage Sale This essay originally appeared in Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily tech newsletter. Sign up here. There are a number of places where geeks like to congregate and spend time with their own people. Star Trek conventions, for example. But if you’re a certain kind of nerd, one of the invitations you most want to get is to Google’s I/O, the annual developer conference where the web giant talks about all of the cool new things it is working on. Arguably the pinnacle of I/O experiences happened in 2012, when four skydivers in wingsuits jumped out of a blimp wearing Google Glass headsets, and live-streamed their descent to the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The latest version of the conference wasn’t quite that exciting, but it was a great example of how Google goog continues to simultaneously be one of the most interesting and also one of the most frustrating companies out there. On the interesting side, Google announced a competitor to Amazon’s popular Echo home-automation hub called Google Home, which lets you search the web and play music by simply saying “OK, Google.” Yes, something with a human name like Alexa or Siri might have been a bit more interesting, but hey, this is Google we’re talking about. Google also announced a couple of innovations designed to improve the lives of smartphone users (and boost Google’s market position). One is a smarter version of Google Now called Assistant, and the other is Android Instant Apps, which allows users to access certain features of mobile apps without having to install them. And on the frustrating side? Well, to take just one example, the company announced a new messaging app called Allo, and a new video-calling app called Duo. But doesn’t Google already have a couple of messaging apps? Yup. There’s Messenger and Hangouts. And doesn’t one of them do video calling? It sure does. So why do we need new ones? A good question, and one that wasn’t really answered at I/O as far as we could tell. There’s arguably no other company doing as many cool things on the web and mobile as Google. And yet there’s also probably no other company that shoves as many half-baked things out the door that will inevitably wind up being mothballed. Experimentation is good, but it can be frustrating as heck. On the upside though, all we have to do is wait until next year’s Google I/O, when we’ll get a bunch more cool new apps!

One notable skater in that 1972 competition was Dorothy Hamill, an American figure skater. Hamill was only 16 years old at the time and finished in the 7th position in the ladies' singles event. She was renowned for her unique combination of athleticism and grace and her trademark haircut—the \\"Hamill Wedge.\\" In the years to come, Dorothy Hamill would go on to develop her skills, becoming the United States Champion in 1974, 1975, and 1976. At the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, Dorothy Hamill competed in the ladies' singles event, and she gave a breathtaking performance that earned her a gold medal. She remains the last American female skater to win a gold medal at the Olympics in the ladies' singles event. Following her Olympic success, Hamill also claimed the title of 1976 World Champion in Goteborg, Sweden, and shortly after, she turned professional to have a decorated career in figure skating shows and competitions. In addition to Hamill, the 1972 World Figure Skating Championships also featured other notable skaters like John Curry from the United Kingdom, who won a gold medal in men's singles at the 1976 Winter Olympics, and Irina Rodnina from the Soviet Union, who won the pairs event along with her partner, Alexander Zaitsev, at the same Olympics.

When the Conservatives returned to office in June 1970, she was appointed secretary of state for education and science. After the Conservatives lost power in 1974, she was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet , and was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. Baroness Thatcher became prime minister on 4 May 1979 and went on to earn the nickname \\"the Iron Lady\\", becoming known for her strong responses to the political and economic crisis, which Thatcher's supporters think are good for Britain, while her opposers argue that her policies destroyed British manufacturing.

Title: Priest Movie plot: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To create a zip tie phone holder, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather materials For this project, you will need: - Several zip ties (select the size that will best accommodate your phone's width) - Scissors or wire cutters (to trim excess zip tie material) - A sturdy object to attach the holder to (e.g., a pipe, a handlebar, etc.) Step 2: Create the base Take two zip ties and loop them together, creating a secure connection by pulling one of them tightly around the other. Repeat this process with another pair of zip ties. These connected pairs will serve as the base of the phone holder, with each pair acting as a support for the top and bottom of the phone. Step 3: Create the side loops Take two more zip ties and loop them through the connected zip ties from step 2, so that they are positioned vertically on either side of the base pairs. Make sure the vertical zip ties are parallel to each other and spaced apart according to the width of your phone. Step 4: Connect the side loops Now, loop another zip tie through the top end of the two vertically positioned zip ties, connecting them together. Do the same for the bottom end of the two vertically positioned zip ties. Once connected, these zip ties will create loops on either side of the holder, which will secure the phone in place when inserted. Step 5: Secure the holder to an object At this point, you have a zip tie holder with four loops (top, bottom, left, and right). Attach the holder to your chosen sturdy object by looping a final zip tie through the object and around the back of the vertical zip ties that form the left and right loops. Tighten the zip tie securely to hold your phone holder in place. Step 6: Insert your phone Place your phone into the holder by sliding it between the top and bottom loops, allowing it to rest on the base made by the connected zip tie pairs. Step 7: Trim excess material Using scissors or wire cutters, carefully trim any excess zip tie material to create a cleaner, more polished appearance. By following these steps, you will have created a functional zip tie phone holder that can be easily attached to a sturdy object and hold your phone securely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator? (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... Answer:","completion":"The works that require three voices, including a narrator, are Monteverdi's \\"Armida abbandonata\\" and \\"Il combattimento.\\" Both of these works share several structural similarities, with one of the three voices acting as the narrator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more drier conditions happens, how will it affect animals will have much less to eat. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The proposed perturbation of drier conditions would have a significant effect on the forest fire process, as well as both direct and indirect effects on the animals' access to food resources. Let us discuss these effects step by step. 1. Drier conditions increasing the intensity and extent of forest fires: Drier weather leads to less moisture content in the air and soil, which further increases the dryness and flammability of the trees, plants, and other organic matter on the forest floor. This would result in more intense and widespread forest fires, consuming a larger area of the forest and potentially affecting a wider range of habitats and species. 2. Direct effect of the perturbation on the animals' food availability: With a more extensive forest fire, a larger proportion of plants and trees that provide food for forest-dwelling animals would be destroyed. This would directly reduce the available food supply for the animals. Species that feed on specific vegetation may face an acute shortage of their primary food source, affecting their health, reproduction, and survival. 3. Indirect effect on animal populations in the aftermath of the fire: Apart from the immediate destruction of food resources, drier conditions could have long-lasting indirect effects on the recovery of the ecosystem and the reestablishment of food sources for animals. The regrowth of vegetation after a forest fire can be slower under drier conditions, as the soil may not receive enough moisture to support rapid plant growth. This slow recovery process would mean that animal populations would also take longer to bounce back after a fire, as they rely on the regrowth of vegetation for food and shelter. 4. Effects on predators and prey relationships: With the decline in food resources for various species, there might be increased competition among animals for the limited available food. This could alter the predator-prey dynamics in the ecosystem. Smaller animals may face increased predation risk as larger predators struggle to find sufficient food. In severe cases, predators might need to expand their range in search of alternative food sources, which could lead to changes in the distribution of species within the ecosystem. 5. The possibility of a decline in animal populations: As a result of the direct and indirect effects of drier conditions on food resources, it is likely that animal populations in the affected area would decline after a more extensive forest fire. This decline could be more pronounced among species that have specific dietary requirements or specialized habitats. Additionally, smaller populations may make it more difficult for some animal species to find mates, reproduce, and maintain a stable population size. In summary, the proposed perturbation of drier conditions can have both direct and indirect effects on the food resources available to wildlife after a forest fire. These effects include a more intense and widespread fire, destruction of food sources, slow recovery of vegetation, altered predator-prey relationships, and potential decline in animal populations. Therefore, the statement \\"animals will have much less to eat\\" under drier conditions after forest fires is accurate and highly plausible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - Lake Christabel is a small lake in the north of New Zealand's South Island. It is located 12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass. The lake is the source of the Grey River, one of the longest rivers on the South Island's West Coast, although its outlet is underground. The lake lies behind a landslide dam, thought to have been created by a prehistoric earthquake. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Lake Brunner is the largest lake in the northwestern South Island of New Zealand , covering an area of 40 km² . The lake 's outflow is the Arnold River , a tributary of the Grey River . The lake lies 31 kilometres to the southeast of Greymouth . The main settlement close to the lake is Moana , on the northern shore . Located several kilometres inland from the coast road ( State Highway 6 ) , it is less frequently visited by tourists than many of the West Coast 's scenic highlights , but it is becoming increasingly popular , in part due to its reputation for fishing . Lake Brunner was named by John Rochfort for the 19th century explorer Thomas Brunner . The Mori name for the lake , Kotuku moana , means \`\` Sea of herons '' . The New Zealand freshwater mussel ( Hyridella menziesi ) is found in the lake . By 1976 twenty percent of the catchment of the lake was farmed and there was a population of 84 at the settlement of Moana . - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate. - The Grey River / Mwheranui is located in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It rises in Lake Christabel, one of numerous small lakes on the western side of the Southern Alps,12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass, and runs westward for 120 kilometres before draining into the Tasman Sea at Greymouth. The river was named by explorer Thomas Brunner in honour of New Zealand politician Sir George Grey. The official name of the river was changed to Grey River / Mwheranui in 1998 by way of the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The Maori name for the river system and surrounding area is Mwhera, with Mwheranui being distinguished from the northern branch Little Grey River / Mwheraiti. - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval.

We want to find out how many friends you have to share with (that's our \\"a\\" value) if each of them loses 52 apples as a result. So, how many times does 26 go into -52? That's right, it goes in -2 times! So, we have: a = -2 That means, to share your 26 apples evenly, you would have to \\"unshare\\" it with 2 friends, taking 26 apples from each one. In reality, it doesn't make sense to take apples away from friends, but in math, it's perfectly okay! So the answer is a = -2!

However, learning came fairly easy for me. I was the best in most of my classes, but PE class was my nightmare and made me feel that I was not as good as the others. Miss Forsythe was our PE teacher. She was young and energetic. Everyone liked her. She said that we all had to come to her classes. No one could hide from Miss Forsythe! One day she told me that she wanted me to play a game with another girl in a PE show. I was rather worried that I wouldn't do a good job when she explained her idea, but she was excited. With her encouragement, I had no choice but to agree. It was a \\"boy meets girl\\" game. I played the boy and my classmate, Margaret Ann, played the girl. We were dressed in evening clothes and danced around the floor. According to Miss Forsythe, I had to pick up Margaret Ann when we finished the dance. Since I was not strong enough to pick the tallest girl up, it was she who picked me up. I suddenly felt ten feet tall! It was a huge success and everybody applauded for our excellent performance. What a wonderful ending! Afterwards, I smiled confidently . Miss Forsythe's understanding and willingness to create a place for me in her show (which certainly did not need me) gave me some much needed confidence.

Write an article based on this summary: Be aware that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for consistent information. Put it in writing. Do not agree to accept only rare forms of payment. Do not submit additional work before compensation.","completion":"Title: Staying Vigilant: Identifying Scams and Ensuring a Secure Transaction Introduction In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, it is crucial to remain vigilant and adopt a critical approach towards any transaction or offer that we come across. Not only does this protect us financially, but it also ensures peace of mind. If an offer appears too good to be true, the odds are it probably is. This article aims to provide guidance on identifying potential scams and ensuring a secure transaction by highlighting the importance of seeking consistent information, putting agreements in writing, avoiding unusual payment methods, and not providing additional work without prior compensation. 1. Look for Consistent Information Consistency is an essential aspect when assessing the credibility of any form of communication or transaction. Scammers often provide inconsistent or vague details to confuse their targets and escape culpability. Conduct thorough research to confirm the authenticity of the sender or the party you are dealing with. Cross-check their claims with publicly available information by looking up their company website, social media accounts, or any customer reviews and testimonials. Be cautious of exaggerated claims, manipulated data, or non-existent credentials. 2. Put it in Writing A robust and legally binding written agreement serves as a reliable safeguard against scammers. Ensure that the terms and conditions of your transaction or relationship are clearly stated in a document both parties sign. This reduces the chances of encountering fraudulent activities as scammers usually avoid legal documentation. Additionally, having everything in writing allows you to revert to the agreement if disputes arise, making it significantly easier to resolve any issues. 3. Do Not Agree to Accept Only Rare Forms of Payment Another red flag in identifying scams is the insistence on utilizing unconventional and untraceable payment methods. Be wary of any party that demands payment in cryptocurrencies, gift cards, wire transfers, or any form of payment that may be difficult to trace or recover. Scammers prefer such payment methods as they allow them to remain anonymous and disappear with your money with little chance of being held accountable. Stick with widely accepted forms of payment, such as direct bank transfers, credit cards, or well-established payment platforms like PayPal. 4. Do Not Submit Additional Work Before Compensation In various industries, whether business services, freelance work or online retail, scammers may request additional work or merchandise with the promise of increased payment or future opportunities. Avoid falling into this trap by insisting on being compensated for the initial work or product before offering any additional services or goods. By doing so, you protect your time, resources, and potential income from being exploited. Establish clear communication and agreements regarding payment schedules and terms from the outset to minimize misunderstandings and misrepresentations. Conclusion Although scammers employ increasingly sophisticated methods to deceive their targets, being proactive and vigilant can help protect one's interests and ensure a secure transaction. By paying attention to consistent information, maintaining a legally binding written agreement, avoiding unusual payment methods, and insisting on timely compensation, individuals and businesses can navigate the modern world with a greater sense of security and confidence. Remember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts and stay vigilant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Devil and Daniel Mouse Context: The story is about two struggling mouse musicians, Daniel and Jan. When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music. A frustrated Devil finally leaves, returning to Hell and taking Weez and all his other minions with him. The two mice...

Write an article with the title: \\"This is how jittery financial markets are, in one chart\\"","completion":"Title: \\"This is How Jittery Financial Markets Are, in One Chart\\" Introduction: Financial markets are known for being volatile and unpredictable. These constant fluctuations can make even the savviest investor feel uneasy. To understand the magnitude of jitteriness in today's markets, we've prepared a chart that showcases market volatility in a single, comprehensive visual representation. This article will explore the factors contributing to the jitters and analyze the implications for investors. Step 1: Choose a representation for jitteriness in financial markets For the purpose of our analysis, we have decided to use the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) as a proxy for financial market jitteriness. The VIX index, often referred to as the 'fear index,' measures the level of expected volatility over the next 30 days for the S&P 500 Index. Step 2: Gather historical data on the VIX index To provide a snapshot of how markets have been trembling in recent times, we have gathered historical VIX data to observe fluctuations over the years. This dataset enables a comprehensive understanding of times when markets were more jittery and when they were comparatively stable. Step 3: Create a visually appealing chart depicting VIX trends We have created a multi-year line chart that displays daily VIX data. The peaks and valleys of this chart represent periods of heightened fear and complacency, respectively. The selected format is simple yet powerful, allowing readers to grasp jitteriness in financial markets quickly. Step 4: Analyze the chart and identify notable periods of market jitteriness Upon analyzing the chart, we can observe multiple notable periods of market jitteriness: - The Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 showed a significant spike in the VIX, reaching its all-time high. - In 2011, concerns over the European debt crisis and a downgrade of the United States' credit rating resulted in elevated levels of market volatility. - Short-lived but intense spikes occurred in 2015 and 2018, illustrating the growing sensitivity of markets to geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Step 5: Discuss implications and strategies for investors Jittery financial markets can both present difficulties and uncover opportunities for investors. On one hand, market volatility can lead to investment losses and increased uncertainty, making it challenging to make informed decisions. On the other hand, volatility may open up opportunities for savvy investors to take advantage of price discrepancies. Based on the chart and analysis, some recommendations for investors to navigate jittery markets include: 1. Diversifying investments to minimize risk exposure. 2. Employing a long-term investment strategy to mute the impact of short-term volatility. 3. Remaining well-informed about global economic events and market trends. 4. Always having a contingency plan in place during periods of heightened market turbulence. Conclusion: By examining the VIX index in a single chart, we can effectively gauge the jitteriness of financial markets. This powerful visual representation serves as a helpful reminder that markets have experienced and weathered volatility in the past. As investors navigate the ups and downs of today's unpredictable markets, resilience, diversification, and careful planning are key to mitigating risk and capitalizing on opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia. \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered. and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Please answer this question : Which city will need to change its method of electricity production later? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Nillmar, the city in France that relies on coal as its main source of electricity, will need to change its method of electricity production later. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: 1. Fossil fuels, like coal, are limited resources and may eventually run out. This puts Nillmar at risk of losing its primary source of electricity in the future. 2. The burning of coal for electricity generation causes air pollution, acid rain, and contributes to global warming. These environmental problems may lead to regulatory changes or public pressure pushing Nillmar to adopt cleaner energy production methods. Springfield, the city in the United States that uses nuclear power, has a less urgent need for change. While radioactive elements used in nuclear fission are also limited and relatively rare, nuclear power does not produce air pollution or other environmental problems like burning fossil fuels does. This gives Springfield a significant advantage in terms of environmental impact and sustainability. However, both cities may eventually have to explore alternative energy options as their current resources may run out. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, can offer sustainable solutions to meet future electricity demands and reduce reliance on limited resources like coal and radioactive elements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No, the statement \\"Malian musical traditions are derived from the griots, who are known as 'Keepers of Memories'.\\" does not contain the correct answer to the question \\"What type of garment or accessory is traditionally worn at some of the dances held?\\" The statement is about the origins of Malian musical traditions and does not provide information about garments or accessories worn during their dances. To answer the question, we need to delve into the traditional dance and clothing customs of Mali. Mali is a diverse and culturally rich country in West Africa, with various ethnic groups, each with their unique traditional dances, garments, and accessories. In Malian traditional dances, some common garments and accessories include boubous, grand boubous, and pagne clothing items. Closely tied to their cultural identity, these textiles and garments are beautifully crafted with intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and artistic designs. Here is a brief description of the traditional Malian garments and accessories mentioned above: 1. Boubou: A boubou is a loose-fitting, flowing garment typically worn by both men and women in western Africa. It is often made of hand-dyed fabric and can be adorned with elaborate embroidery. In Mali, boubous are worn by dancers during cultural events, ceremonies, and performances. 2. Grand boubou: A grand boubou is a variation of the boubou, but it is more formal and often worn by people of higher social status. This floor-length garment features a wide, flowing cut and beautiful details such as embroidery and beadwork. It is worn at special occasions, including traditional dances and ceremonies. 3. Pagne: Pagne is a large, rectangular piece of fabric that can be wrapped and draped around the body in different ways. It is a versatile piece of clothing that can be used as a skirt, dress, or wrap, depending on personal preference and regional customs. Pagne clothes are often brightly colored and feature beautiful patterns, adding a festive touch to the traditional dances. In summary, the statement about Malian musical traditions and griots does not explicitly answer the question about traditional garments or accessories worn at dances. However, by examining Malian culture, one can learn about the different types of garments and accessories, such as boubous, grand boubous, and pagne, traditionally worn at dances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: When was the House of Bricks built? Movie plot title: Three Little Bops Movie plot: The short opens with a display of the book that shows the Three Little Pigs who used to play pipes and dance jigs. The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate...

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Q: Context_1 : The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, is a centre-right political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently the governing party, having been so since the 2010 general election, where a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats was formed. In 2015, the Conservatives led by David Cameron won a surprise majority and formed the first Conservative majority government since 1992. However, the 2017 snap election on Thursday 8 June resulted in a hung parliament, and the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority. They are reliant on the support of a Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in order to command a majority in the House of Commons through a confidence-and-supply deal. The party leader, Theresa May, has served as both Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister since 13 July 2016. It is the largest party in local government with 9,237 councillors. The Conservative Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United Kingdom, the other being its modern rival, the Labour Party. The Conservative Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defence, deregulation, and restrictions on trade unions. Context_2 : The Christian Democratic Party of the Overthrow (Greek: Χριστιανοδημοκρατικό Κόμμα Ανατροπής ), previously named as Christian Democratic Party of Greece (Greek: Χριστιανοδημοκρατικό Κόμμα Ελλάδος ) is a conservative and Christian democratic political party of Greece. It was founded in May 23, 2013 by Nikos Nikolopoulos, a former MP of the New Democracy party from Achaea. Context_3 : The Greens (Greek: Πράσινοι, \\"Prasinoi\\") are a Greek political party that supports the principles of political ecology. Founded by MEP Nikos Chrysogelos after his retirement from the party of Ecologist Greens. Context_4 : The Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005. The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child. It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta. The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada. In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party. The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005. Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear. If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again. Context_5 : Nikos Kouzilos (Greek: Νίκος Κούζηλος) is a Greek politician and member of the Greek Parliament for the Golden Dawn. Context_6 : Konstantinos A. Plevris (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Α. Πλεύρης , born 1939 in Athens), in English sometimes \\"Constantine Plevris\\" or \\"Kostas Plevris\\", is a Greek attorney of law of the Greek Supreme Court and far right author. A prolific writer, over the course of decades he has authored a number of books and other texts relating to Greek history, Greek culture, sociology, and politics, with a clear nationalist, homophobic (such as his book titled \\"\\"Οι Κίναιδοι\\"\\", a vehement polemic against homosexuals) content. He was the founder and leader of two nationalist parties, 4th of August and Front Line, with the former political party not only playing a significant role in influencing and shaping the future direction of the Greek extreme right, but also standing in its own right as a prominent pre-junta political movement in general. He has also cooperated (according to interviews he gave to various publications, including one to Italian magazine \\"L'Europeo\\" in 1976, which were quoted and accepted as proof in a court of law where he was the plaintiff against author Nikos Kleitsikas) with various European neo-fascist groups (including the Ordine Nuovo), and figures such as Pino Rauti, Pino Romualdi, Giorgio Almirante, and others of the same ilk. He later briefly joined the right-wing party Popular Orthodox Rally, as its leading candidate in the 2004 elections. He hosts the weekly television show \\"Edo Ellas\\" (Εδώ Ελλάς in Greek) on the EXTRA-3 channel, and was the host of \\"Istorikes Mnimes\\" (Ιστορικές Μνήμες) on TeleAsty, Karatzaferis' TV channel. He is father of Thanos Plevris, former member of the Greek parliament with the nationalist party Popular Orthodox Rally. Context_7 : The Boerstaat Party (English: \\"Boer State Party\\" ) is a right wing South African political party founded on 30 September 1986 by the late Robert van Tonder. It was never officially registered as a political party because it was unable to rally 500 persons under one roof, a requirement under South African electoral law for official political party status. It was never represented in the South African Parliament, neither in the apartheid era nor after democratisation. In 1989, it joined the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in declaring support for Jaap Marais, the leader of the Herstigte Nasionale Party and has worked with the HNP on occasion since. The party was a charter member of the Afrikaner Volksfront coalition group. It has also operated with the paramilitary group, the \\"Boere Weerstandsbeweging\\" (Boer Resistance Movement) led by Andrew Ford.

It is led by Nikolaos Michaloliakos. Context_9 : The leader called Sisowath Thomico had instead of creating a political party chose to create on Friday 28 July 2006 what was called the \\"Sampoan Sangkum Cheat Niyum (Alliance of the national community).\\" This was because when gathering some of the parties like the Khmer Unity Party and Angkor Empire Party etc. Thomico said \\"\\"We decided not to form the party yet since the alliance is not yet complete\\" which meant the Thomico was giving more time to other political parties to join the alliance and postpone the changing of the alliance into a new political party with a new name.

Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. Would Archimedes' device more likely or less likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one? Hint: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one. As one of the greatest scientists and inventors, Archimedes was known for creating machines that made work easier by utilizing the principles mentioned in the hint.

The ad and Mr. Christie’s attack on the senator from Florida represent an escalation of tensions between the two Republican candidates a week before they take the stage with other rivals at their next debate in Charleston, S.C. “I’ve been in very tough races before,” said Mr. Christie, pointing to the attack-filled campaign that Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, ran against him in the 2009 New Jersey race for governor. “This isn’t my first rodeo,” he added. “And if Marco Rubio thinks by putting out a couple of negative ads on me that somehow he’s going to intimidate me it just shows how inexperienced” and “unprepared” the senator is to take on Hillary Clinton. He said that whoever faces Mrs. Clinton, who is now leading the polls of the Democratic field, must be someone “who has been through the wars,” Mr. Christie said. “Not somebody who’s a first-term United States senator who has never had a tough race in his life. This guy’s been spoon-fed every victory he’s ever had in his life.” He went on: “That’s the kind of person that we want to put on stage against Hillary Clinton? I don’t think so. She’ll pat him on the head and then cut his heart out.” Mr. Rubio has focused increasingly on Mr. Christie and others who are competing against him for establishment support, after waging a battle against Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative favorite, for several weeks. Mr. Christie attacked Mr. Rubio for absenteeism from the Senate recently; Mr. Rubio’s team responded by pointing to Mr. Christie’s own long disappearances from New Jersey during his presidential campaign. In remarks to reporters after meeting with voters in Nashua, N.H. on Thursday, Mr. Rubio let out a loud chuckle when asked about Mr. Christie’s comments. And he quickly tried to deflect the focus away from questions about his readiness as a candidate and toward Mr. Christie’s mixed record as governor of New Jersey. “Chris has a very liberal record for a Republican. I mean he supported Common Core. He ran for office as a supporter of gun control. He personally gave a contribution to Planned Parenthood. So I’m sure he doesn’t really want to have a conversation about the issues because the truth is our next president has to be someone who’s going to overturn all the damage Barack Obama has done to America, not continue it. And we’ll continue to talk about the policy differences that I have with Chris or anyone else in this race.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about two people who want to be the next President of the United States. Their names are Chris Christie and Marco Rubio. They are both in the same group called the Republican Party. Chris Christie said some mean things about Marco Rubio. He thinks that Marco is not strong enough to compete against another person named Hillary Clinton. Hillary is from a different group called the Democratic Party. Chris and Marco are going to talk more about their ideas in a big meeting called a debate very soon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop? Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands. Hint: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.","completion":"The farmer who did not increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop is Bubba. Here is how I reached this conclusion: 1. The paragraph states clearly that both Bubba and Dean were aware of the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. 2. However, only Dean took active steps to promote the growth of this fungi by growing cover crops on his lands. This is important because, as the hint suggests, AM fungi are biotrophic and rely on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. By planting cover crops, Dean extended the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring, thereby promoting the establishment of a more extensive hyphal network. 3. This network would subsequently lead to an increase in extraradical hyphal colonization, which in turn benefits the new crops planted as they can tap into this well-established hyphal network for adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, thus improving crop yield. Since Bubba did not grow cover crops in his field, it can be inferred that he did not enhance the growth of the extraradical hyphal network in his soil. Therefore, the answer to the question is Bubba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Summarize this article: Image copyright Reuters Image caption Witnesses have seen planes near Aleppo, which has suffered severe damage in the fighting Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State are training its members in Syria to fly three captured fighter jets, according to a UK-based activist group that monitors the conflict. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said witnesses had seen the planes being flown around a military airport in Aleppo. Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have launched an attack on IS militants near Tikrit. The city was among the areas in Syria and Iraq seized by IS this year. Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the SOHR, said IS was using Iraqi officers who were pilots under ex-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to train fighters in Syria. \\"People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,\\" he said. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The aircraft are said to be MiG-21s, like this Indian Air Force jet outside Delhi in 2012, or MiG-23s It is not known how many Iraqi pilots have defected. Witnesses told the SOHR the planes appeared to be MiG-21 or MiG-23 models. The BBC's Sally Nabil in Baghdad says IS has three planes which it captured earlier from the Syrian military in Aleppo and Raqqa. US Central Command spokesman Col Patrick Ryder told Reuters the Pentagon was \\"not aware\\" of IS conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere. Aleppo became a key battleground in the fight between Syrian rebels, which now include IS, and government forces after the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. New co-ordination Separately, the Iraqi government said its troops had gained ground to the north and west of Tikrit and cut an important IS supply route. Correspondents say that past efforts by the government to regain territory in the area have ended in failure. Image copyright AFP Image caption The mainly Kurdish town of Kobane is strategically important in the fight against IS Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are continuing to fight militants in the northern Syrian town of Kobane. US-led warplanes struck IS positions on Friday, taking advantage of new co-ordination with the town's Kurdish defenders. The Pentagon confirmed there were six air strikes near Kobane, saying initial reports indicated they successfully \\"struck three IS buildings, destroyed two IS fighting positions, suppressed three IS fighting positions and destroyed two IS vehicles\\". There was another air strike on an IS oil facility near Shadadi. The US military also said its \\"partner nation military forces\\" had conducted two air strikes in Iraq, near Baiji. On Thursday, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal told the BBC that the militants had been driven out of most of Kobane. Our correspondent says refugees watching their town from a hilltop nearby agree that there are only two or three neighbourhoods that are still the scene of fighting. The battle for Kobane, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab, is regarded as a major test of whether the US-led coalition's air campaign can push back IS. Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago. More than 160,000 people have fled in the face of the IS advance. Capturing the town would give the group unbroken control of a long stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border. IS fighters have gained a reputation for brutal tactics, including mass killings and beheadings of soldiers and journalists. ||||| BEIRUT (AP) — The Islamic State group has captured and is test flying, with the help of former Iraqi air force pilots, several fighter jets captured earlier from air bases belonging to the Syrian army, a Syrian activist group said Friday.

Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, and its surrounding... (Associated Press) The report by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights could not be independently confirmed, and U.S. official said they had no reports of IS militants flying jets in support of their forces on the ground. The new development came as the Islamic State group in Iraq pressed its offensive on the strategic city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad. The militants appeared to be taking advantage of the focus of U.S.-led airstrikes on the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, along the border with Turkey, to concentrate on their second front in Iraq. The Observatory said the planes, seen flying over the Jarrah air base in the countryside of Aleppo province in eastern Syria this week, are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets. Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Observatory, said the planes have been flying at a low altitude, \\"apparently to avoid being detected by Syrian military radar in the area.\\" He described the flights as a \\"moral victory\\" for the Islamic State group, saying \\"the jets could not fly much further without being knocked down by the (international) coalition.\\" The report on the IS flights in Aleppo added yet another layer of complexity to the Mideast crisis in the wake of the onslaught by the Islamic State militants. The U.S. and its allies are bombing IS bases in Syria and Iraq, where the extremists have seized large swaths of territory. During its blitz, the Islamic State group is known to have seized fighter jets from at least one air base it captured from the Syrian army in the eastern Raqqa province earlier this year. Militant websites had posted pictures of IS fighters posing next to the fighter jets, but it was unclear if they were operational. Abdurrahman said Islamic State members were being trained by Iraqi officers who had joined the group and who were once pilots under Saddam Hussein. In January, Islamic State militants also captured the Jarrah air base in Syria after bitter clashes with rival extremists and Syrian rebel groups. A mix of several Islamic rebel groups battling Syrian President Bashar Assad — including al-Qaida's Syrian branch, the Nusra Front — had seized the base from government troops in early 2013. Gen. Lloyd Austin, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, said he has no operational reports of IS militants flying jets in support of their forces on the ground. Austin, the head of U.S. Central Command who is directing the fight in Iraq and Syria, told Pentagon reporters that he also has no information about Iraqi pilots defecting to IS. However, an Iraqi intelligence official said the government in Baghdad is aware of several ex-Iraqi military officers going to Syria to train militants with the Islamic State group. The militants acquired war planes from al-Tabaqa air base in Syria but did not get any when they toppled the Iraqi military in Mosul, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media. Meanwhile, clashes between Syrian Kurdish fighters and Islamic State militants continued on Friday in the town of Kobani, along the Syrian-Turkish border. The Kurdish fighters have begun sharing information with the U.S.-led coalition to coordinate strikes against Islamic State militants there, a Kurdish official said. The admission could further complicate relations between Washington and Turkey, which views the main Syrian Kurdish militia with suspicion because of its links to the Kurdish PKK insurgent group. \\"There is direct coordination between Kurdish and American coalition forces,\\" Nawaf Khalil, spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, told The Associated Press. \\"That's no secret. It began about a week ago,\\" he said. The party's armed wing, known as the People's Protection Units or YPG, has been struggling to defend the town — also known under its Arabic name, Ayn Arab — against the Islamic State militants, despite dozens of U.S.-led airstrikes against the extremists. Kurdish fighters provided \\"correct and credible intelligence\\" early on, building trust with the U.S.-led coalition, Khalil said. There was no immediate comment from U.S. military officials. The battle for Kobani has emerged as a key test for the U.S.-led air campaign against the IS group in Syria, with the vast majority of strikes conducted in and around the embattled town. Turkey has ground forces and tanks deployed just across the border but has declined to intervene. It views the Syrian Kurdish YPG as an extension of the PKK, which has waged a long and bloody insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the United States and NATO. Khalil's acknowledgement of coordination came after State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that U.S. officials had met with members of the Syrian Kurdish party for the first time. Khalil said the meeting took place last week in Paris, and that it wasn't the first time the two sides had met. \\"The contact isn't new, but the admission of it is,\\" he said. He said the party had not publicized the meetings because it did not want to cause more strife between Ankara and Washington. ___ Associated Press writer Vivian Salama contributed to this report from Baghdad. ||||| BEIRUT Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air. The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria. U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes. \\"They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,\\" Abdulrahman said. \\"People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,\\" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border. Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report. It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military. U.S. MILITARY KEEPING \\"CLOSE EYE\\" \\"We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,\\" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State. \\"We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.\\" General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. \\"We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,\\" he told a Pentagon news briefing. Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats. The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

Answer the following question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. Question: suppose less toxins to remove happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If there are fewer toxins for the liver to remove, the workload on the liver would initially be reduced as it will have to process a lower volume of harmful substances. This could potentially lead to the liver functioning more efficiently with respect to other tasks it carries out. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the cleansing of blood enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion, this process may be affected in the following ways when there are fewer toxins present: 1. More efficient blood cleansing: Since the liver has a reduced workload in terms of detoxification, it may have more capacity to focus on the blood cleansing process. This means that it could potentially function more efficiently in removing waste materials and preserving the beneficial components in the blood. 2. Enhanced processing of vitamins and minerals: The liver's primary role in processing vitamins and minerals for the body would have a more significant impact as there would be less interference from the detoxification process. This could lead to enhanced absorption of these nutrients and their better integration into the body's various metabolic processes. 3. No effect: It is also possible that the liver's efficiency in processing blood enriched with vitamins and minerals remains unchanged. The lessened workload in detoxification may not necessarily affect the liver's capacity to cleanse the blood and process nutrients for the body effectively. The liver is an incredibly adaptive and resilient organ, and a minor change in the toxin removal process may not necessarily alter its efficiency in carrying out its other functions. In conclusion, if there are fewer toxins for the liver to remove, the liver may function more efficiently in cleansing the blood and processing its contents. However, the extent to which this occurs would depend on the liver's overall capacity and how well it adapts to the reduced workload. It could result in more, less, or no change at all in its efficiency concerning the second effect mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Your questions should have a point and help to tell what kind of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the topic of conversation. If someone insists on one topic, it means he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to the voice. If the voice sounds bored, then, it's time for you to change the topic.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is the following review positive or negative? I ordered flowers from My Angels Touch yesterday to send a nice bouquet to my friend today for her wedding shower. The picture and description of the bouquet was very specific on the website, so I was sad and disappointed when my friend sent me the picture of the bouquet that arrived. First, it was not as full and pretty as the picture, the daisies were wilted, and we couldn't find the lilies that were supposed to be in it. I called the shop to complain and the daughter of the owner called her mom to tell her she didn't put lilies in the bouquet (I overheard the conversation). The mother called me back and said she had included them and tried to say I didn't know what lilies were (I realize these aren't supposed to be stargazers). So my friend looked closer and we saw there were little green wilted things that didn't look like lilies at all. I told the owner (politely too) that this bouquet looked like a cheap grocery store one. Plus, I purchased the step up from the original bouquet on the website. She said that was offensive to her...to HER. She said if I'm really upset, she can send more flowers tomorrow. Unfortunately, my friends wedding shower is today and I even posted a screenshot of my email receipt to show that the wilted flowers in the picture are from the same day of delivery (not days later). The owner said she stands by her product so I told her the pictures could stand for her product too then. All together I spent 70 on what was maybe the equivalent of a 20 bouquet from the grocery store. The flowers were unhealthy and I'm sad that my friend didn't get to have a nice bouquet on her special day. Super disappointed that the owner wouldn't help me out by at least replacing the bouquet today or just admitting she didn't have fresh flowers to deliver on this order so that I could buy nice ones from another shop. Terrible business, listen to all of the reviews here because they're not lying. Wish I had. I uploaded the pictures to this business' page. Take a look and see for yourself.","completion":"This review is negative.

Many of the patterns in here are quite intuitive; meaning, that one probably doesn't need a book to be able to figure out how to knit them. Books with felting patterns should highlight patterns that are difficult to create. Otherwise, what's the point of buying a book? The challenges of felting are in determining scale and ratio, and anticipating shrinkage when you felt the item. None of these patterns are particularly interesting or nice-looking.Given its 2003 press date, I would have liked to see more fashionable items like a bucket hat, a striped felted bag with closure, and more useful household items, like a fruit bowl. Instead, the patterns include a bowler hat, felted mittens, dowdy looking slippers and several simple square bags. Its saving grace is a nice-looking felted rug, but I could have probably figured that one out as well. Isn't it just a rectangle? Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"[1]. Yes. The product review is negative because it highlights the reviewer's disappointment with the knitting book due to the lack of challenging and fashionable patterns, as well as the simplicity of the designs. The reviewer emphasizes that they expected more from the book, such as innovative and stylish patterns, and useful household items. The only positive aspect mentioned is the inclusion of a nice-looking felted rug, but the reviewer still expresses that they could have probably figured that one out themselves. Overall, the review indicates the reviewer does not feel the book is worth the investment and suggests others save their money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(WRDW/WAGT) – News 12 reported on an exclusive story about one charter school giving parents the option for using paddling as a corporal punishment in class. Since then, news outlets like the National Geographic, BBC and other national and international news tellers have shared that story. Parents at GSIC are speaking out about the consent forms sent home earlier this month. Lacie Dickerson says her daughter, Lydia, shocked her with the paper. \\"Lydia said, ‘mom I have a paper I need you to sign’, I said ‘well what is it?’ And she said it’s a ‘can they spank me or not form’,\\" Dickerson laughed. She has two kids at GSIC. Parents got a consent form asking to use corporal punishment on their kids this school year. \\"It's 2018 and they are sending that home. It's ridiculous,” parent Justin Cohen fumed. \\"The whole policy is ridiculous.\\" It’s a policy that spells out the punishment with a large, wooden paddle. If signed, an administrator could spank them behind closed doors, but no more than three times. But these two parents have two very different opinions. Cohen's son is a first-grader at the charter school. Lia Fernandez: \\"When your son handed you this consent from, what were you thinking?\\" Justin Cohen: \\"For GSIC to go ahead and [say] 'we want to paddle your child because we think it's a good idea…no.” Cohen says it's not just about checking off yes or no. He says it's almost like a punishment if he marks no, because in that case it means upwards of five days of suspension for his child. \\"It's thinly veiled coercion. If you don't sign it, if you don't let us paddle your child, we're going to suspend them for 5 days.” Dickerson has a different point of view when it comes to Lydia. \\"It doesn't bother me. I'm used to it because we came out of Jefferson County, and when they were in elementary school they were paddling there,\\" Dickerson explained to News 12 Wednesday. Jefferson and Burke Counties are both still enforcing corporal punishment. Dickerson’s child went to a school there before GSIC. \\"When they were younger I always checked ‘yes’ when they were in Wrens, but they should call me first.\\" Lacie says now that her kids are older, in 8th and 9th grade, she says they're too old to be spanked. Because of that, this time she checked “no”. The principal says they almost have all the consent forms back. Out of the 650 students they have, she says a little over one-third of them show parents saying “yes” to paddling. But the majority of those parents are saying no. Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018News 12 First at Five HEPHZIBAH, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) -- An area school recently sent home consent forms informing them of a new corporal policy at an area school. The superintendent says they’ve received a little over a hundred forms back, a third of them giving consent to paddle their child. “In this school, we take discipline very seriously,” said Jody Boulineau, Superintendent of GSIC. GSIC is going old school with a new policy for this year. \\"There was a time where corporal punishment was kind of the norm in school and you didn't have the problems that you have,” the Superintendent said. You heard that right. Georgia School for Innovation and the Classics, a K through 9 charter school, is bringing back paddling students as a form of discipline. \\"It's just one more tool that we have in our disciplinary toolbox that we can use,” Superintendent Boulineau said. Parents got a \\"consent to paddle form\\" asking them if they're ok with administrators hitting their child with a wooden paddle. \\"There's no obligation, it's not required. A parent can either give consent for us to use that as a disciplinary measure or they can deny consent,\\" he said. The form spells it out: a student will be taken into an office behind closed doors. The student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle. The form says no more than three licks should be given. Superintendent Boulineau says the parent response has been across the board. \\" I've heard 'great, it's about time, 'we're so glad that this is happening again, they should've never taken it out of schools'. All the way to 'oh my goodness I can't believe you are doing that'.\\" A controversial policy that hasn't been around for years. If parents opt out of paddling, they have to agree to up to 5 days of suspension. \\"I honestly feel like it's something that's not going to be used very often. Sometimes it's just kind of the threat of it being there becomes a deterrent in itself.\\" This is actually still legal in Georgia and 19 other states but it's rare for a school to have a policy for it. GSIC is the only school in our area that will start paddling students who are misbehaving this year. Even if parents agree to it, they are contacted and the school says they will use a three strike policy so the paddling doesn't happen on the first or second offense. ||||| A school in Hephzibah, Georgia, is drawing national attention after sending consent forms to parents informing them of a new policy of using paddling as a form of punishment for students, CBS affiliate WRDW-TV reports. The Georgia School of Innovation and the Classics (GSIC), a kindergarten-through-9th-grade charter school, is bringing back paddling — spanking a child on the behind with a wooden board — as a form of discipline. Superintendent Jody Boulineau told WRDW that about 100 parents sent back the forms, and one-third gave the school consent to paddle their child. \\"In this school, we take discipline very seriously,\\" the superintendent said. \\"There was a time where corporal punishment was kind of the norm in school and you didn't have the problems that you have.\\" Boulineau said parents can deny giving permission to the school. The form sent home explained the steps the school would take to discipline children with a paddle. \\"A student will be taken into an office behind closed doors. The student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle,\\" the form, which was obtained by WRDW, reads. Students will be paddled after their third offense. The form also says \\"no more than three licks should be given.\\" The paddle will be 24 inches in length, six inches in width and 3/4 inches in thickness, the form specifies. Parents will be notified if their child is to be paddled by an administrator, according to the form, which CBS News has not independently verified. WRDW \\"It's just one more tool that we have in our disciplinary toolbox that we can use,\\" Boulineau said. The superintendent said the response from parents has varied. \\"I've heard, 'Great, it's about time, we're so glad that this is happening again, they should've never taken it out of schools.' All the way to, 'Oh my goodness, I can't believe you are doing that,'\\" he said. Although paddling is seen as a controversial policy that has not been used widely in schools for years, it is legal in Georgia and 19 other states. Parents who opt out of the paddling must agree to up to five days of suspension as punishment for their children. GSIC is the only school in the Augusta area that will start paddling students who are misbehaving this year. Boulineau, as well as other administrators and board members, have not responded to CBS News' request for comment. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A school in Hephzibah, Georgia, has introduced a controversial policy of paddling as a form of corporal punishment for misbehaving students. The Georgia School of Innovation and the Classics (GSIC), a charter school for kindergarten to 9th grade, sent consent forms to parents detailing the use of a wooden paddle to discipline students. Around 100 parents sent back the forms, with one-third granting consent. Paddling is seen as a controversial policy and has not been widely used for decades, but it remains legal in 20 states in the US, including Georgia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I was disappointed in my first visit to the Las Vegas location of this cafe. I had lunch at the NM Cafe in Chicago several years ago and the experience was delightful and elegant. The food was fresh and the service was superb. I was excited to repeat this experience. Today's lunch, however, was disappointing. The waitress seemed to be unconcerned. I ordered the salad with salmon. The salmon was pretty good, but the avocado was hard to find and the mixed greens were not fresh. I ate more than half of the salad and didn't complain until the end. (My fault! I hate to complain and hardly saw my waitress anyway.) By the time I had eaten half of my salad, I had set about ten pieces of wilted greens off to the side of my plate. When I asked for the bill, I showed the waitress the wilted lettuce and said I expected more from NM. She barely made eye contact with me, apologized w/little expression, took the plate and returned w/the bill. I will not return. Is this review positive or negative? OPTIONS: - negative. - positive. Answer:","completion":"- negative. This review is negative because the person had a disappointing experience at the cafe. They did not like the service, the salad was not fresh, and the waitress did not seem to care about their complaints.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Glue together cards with cutout centers.","completion":"To determine the best solution for gluing cards with cutout centers, let's first consider two common types of adhesives: liquid glue and glue sticks. 1. Liquid glue: Pros: -Strong bonds: Liquid glues generally create a strong bond, which is essential for holding the cutout centers of the cards together. -Quick drying: Some liquid glues dry quickly, ensuring that your project won't be delayed for long periods. Cons: -Messy: Liquid glues can be messy, seeping through the cutout centers and affecting the appearance of the project. -Hard to control: It may be difficult to control the application of liquid glue, leading to uneven bonds or excess glue on the cards. 2. Glue sticks: Pros: -Cleaner: Glue sticks are less messy and easier to control, ensuring that the cutout centers remain clean and the cards stay intact. -Easier application: Glue sticks are easier to apply, and you can quickly cover a larger area of the card, even around the cutout center. Cons: -Weaker bond: Glue sticks are less strong than some liquid glues, potentially causing the cards to separate over time or with handling. -Slow drying: Some glue sticks may take longer to dry, which can be problematic if you are working on a time-sensitive project. Based on the pros and cons of each adhesive, the best solution for gluing cards with cutout centers would be to use a glue stick. While they may have a slightly weaker bond than liquid glue, glue sticks offer a cleaner, easier-to-control solution that is less likely to damage the appearance of the cards or the cutout centers. If you're concerned about the strength of the bond, consider using a high-quality glue stick designed for heavier materials or reinforce the glued areas with transparent adhesive tape once the glue has dried."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Linguistics is the scientific study of language, and involves an analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context. The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE Indian grammarian Pāṇini, who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his \\"Aṣṭādhyāyī \\". Hypothesis: Context is not part of linguistics.","completion":"After reviewing the given paragraph, it appears that the provided hypothesis, \\"Context is not part of linguistics,\\" is not true. In the paragraph, linguistics is defined as the scientific study of language, and it specifically highlights three main components of its analysis; language form, language meaning, and language in context. Language form refers to the physical structure of language, encompassing the rules for constructing words, phrases, and sentences. Language meaning encompasses the ways in which words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning, often analyzed through syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Lastly, language in context refers to the way language is used in real-world situations, involving factors such as social, cultural, and situational contexts in which communication takes place. Since the paragraph clearly states that language in context is an integral part of linguistics, the hypothesis claiming that context is not a part of linguistics is false. The broader field of linguistics acknowledges the importance of contextual factors in the usage and understanding of language, as it is essential for understanding how language functions in the real world, and guides our interpretations of intended meaning. Additionally, the study of language in context includes areas such as sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and pragmatics, demonstrating that context is undeniably a significant aspect of linguistics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider the following activities to keep you busy: Reading Watching television Listening to music Writing You may have a difficult time sleeping alone at night because of feeling lonely, missing the partner you used to sleep with, or hearing strange noises. To cope with sleeping alone, turn off your television, tablet, or computer about an hour before bedtime to prepare yourself for sleep. You can also make falling asleep easier by: Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and food too late in the day Avoiding stressful activities, like exercise, right before bed Keeping the room lights on low Playing soft music Using a sound machine or ear plugs to drown out other noises Keeping the room cool Using comfortable, soft bedding, like a body pillow Wearing a sleep mask or using curtains to block out light Getting up to read, take a bath, or drink hot tea if you find yourself tossing and turning Having a structured evening for yourself at home will help keep your thoughts from straying into loneliness when you’re alone at night. Having a routine can also help keep you motivated and feel fulfilled while being alone. For example, if you come home from work at 5 p.m., you can schedule time for relaxation, exercise, dinner, socialization, and perhaps a hobby before bedtime. It can be helpful to keep a regular bedtime, although a perk of being alone is that you can go to sleep whenever you want! When you live alone or are alone at night, it may feel like a waste of time to make yourself a meal and sit down at the table to eat. However, making your meals special and keeping your mealtimes consistent is a good way to ward off loneliness at night. For example, if you’re alone at night on a holiday, fix yourself the meal you typically would have had with your family or others. As you eat, you can relive special memories you have of that holiday and feel less alone. Although there may be many hardships or negatives to living alone and being alone at night, like having to take care of all the chores on your own, try not to dwell on those. Reminding yourself of the positives can help improve your state of mind. For example, being alone allows you to: Play whatever music or television shows you want to Clean up how and when you want to Decorate your house how you want to Have silence and time to recharge the way you want to Although being alone doesn’t necessarily mean you’re lonely, it’s important to recognize and accept any feelings of loneliness or sadness you may be experiencing. Examine where they are coming from. Perhaps you’re feeling lonely and alone because you’re single, newly divorced, or widowed. It’s important to express and understand these feelings so that you can then begin to feel more comfortable when you're at home by yourself.

Question: During what time period was there the largest growth of scientific societies? Context: Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century. Answer:","completion":"The largest growth of scientific societies occurred during the 18th century, as evidenced by the fact that over seventy official scientific societies were founded in Europe by 1789.

This article: During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow.

Question: What effect is displayed on a disc with 77 lines, spinning at 77.92 rpm, when exposed to 50 Hz light? Context: In 1925, 78.26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor. This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \\"stand still\\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz). After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats. Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records.

Summarize: Pope Francis' trip this weekend to the Greek island of Lesbos, which hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have used as a stepping stone in their trip to northern Europe, clearly emerges from the Pope's own personal desire. Migrants and refugees have always occupied a central part of his discourse - and so has his criticism of the way developed countries have dealt with this crisis. \\"All too often,\\" he said recently of migrants, \\"[they] meet along the way with death or, in any event, rejection by those who could offer them welcome and assistance.\\" In two speeches - at the Moira refugee centre and at the Mytilene port - Pope Francis is set to urge leaders and societies to show more compassion for those fleeing war and poverty. But more than anything, the short visit is seen as hugely symbolic - and if you look at Pope Francis' travel record, it seems that for him, making an appearance is enough of a message. In July 2013, his first trip outside Rome after being elected pontiff was to Lampedusa, the tiny Italian island off the coast of Libya that - like Lesbos - was becoming a symbol of the incipient migrant crisis. The visit occurred months before the attention of the world turned to the deadly crossing between Libya and Italy. Ever since then, it became clear that travelling to the front line of a conflict would become a recurring feature of Pope Francis' travel agenda. And it has also become obvious that the Vatican is increasingly aware of the symbolic power that the Pope has - and the global media attention that comes with a visit by one of the world's most popular leaders. So the Pope is also using his seemingly unrivalled media power to shed light on certain conflicts around the world - even if this means pushing the boundaries on the definition of papal travel. Take his trip last November to the Central African Republic (CAR), one of the poorest countries in the world, ravaged by more than three years of armed conflict between Christians and Muslims. For months after the Vatican first announced the trip, observers insisted that it posed too high a security risk for the Pope himself and the crowds that were expected to greet him in Bangui. After all, never before had a pope visited an active war zone. Pope Francis, oblivious to calls to reconsider, went ahead with the trip - visiting a mosque and camp for displaced people, holding a mass at the cathedral and calling on factions to lay down their weapons. After the papal plane left the conflict has continued, but the visit did bring an enormous amount of media coverage to a conflict that ranks amongst the most under-reported war of our times. It was the \\"Francis effect\\", in full form. In 2014, moved by news of the savage murder by the mafia of a three-year-old child in the southern Italian region of Calabria, he travelled to the remote village of Cassano allo Ionio. At the stronghold of the local crime syndicate known as 'Ndrangheta, the Pope issued a strong message to mobsters: you are all excommunicated. And his words reverberated across the Italian peninsula, where the mafia continues to expand its tentacles. Full of standout moments too was his presence at the fence between Mexico and the United States earlier this year, or his visit to Cuba in September last year, where he supported the historic thawing of the island's relationship with the United States. But is there anything more than pure symbolism in the Pope's travels? Sometimes his attempts to mediate in international conflicts are seen as naive, if not somewhat clumsy. During his trip to the Holy Land in May 2014, at the end of a mass at Bethlehem's Manger Square, he broke the news that he was inviting the then Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to a \\"day of prayer\\" at the Vatican. A few weeks later, the event did take place and under the eye of the world's media the three leaders - joined by the Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew - shared a slightly awkward photo opportunity, during which they planted an olive tree in the Vatican Gardens. It is difficult to establish what concrete, on-the-ground effect - if any - such a gesture had on the decades-long conflict in the Middle East. But, ignoring the sceptics, this Pope seems keen to continue his policy of getting involved in continuing crises - visiting hotspots in what he calls the \\"peripheries\\" of the world and issuing strong calls for more mercy for the downtrodden. This weekend's trip to Lesbos is clearly emblematic of this approach.

Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy.

He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye.

Hats and hair accessories are also a great option for styling your hair. Use them to show off your personal style. You don’t need to wear makeup to be beautiful, but do it if it makes you happy. Use a foundation, tinted moisturizer, or BB cream to even out your skin tone. Then, play around with blush, eyeshadow, and lipstick that make you feel confident. Do a natural makeup look if you don’t want to look like you’re wearing makeup. Do either a bold lip or a dramatic eye. You don’t want to do both at the same time because your look will be too overwhelming. Every body shape can be beautiful, so don’t worry about your size. Instead, focus on choosing pieces that show off your assets and make you feel your best. Donate any pieces that don’t make you feel fabulous. Try on everything in your wardrobe and only keep the clothes you love. Show off what makes you feel confident. For instance, wear short skirts to show off your legs or a backless top to show off a sculpted back. Look for great brands and really unique pieces for affordable prices at consignment shops or thrift shops.

Product review: A large brown box appears on the doorstep of teacher, Elizabeth Stone's front door. Inside she would find the journals and inner workings of former student, former human being, former AIDS patient; Vincent.This book was extremely slow going. I felt that it asked too may questions and sort of implied the story rather than to tell it. Yes I am aware that Miss. Stone only had the journals as a reference yet I still believe this work could have been executed in a way as to end up with a much more impressive piece of writing.In reading \\"A Boy I Once Knew,\\" I also came across a variety of typos and errors thus proving the type of effort that went into the book.Stone also seemed to focus much more on her life than Vincent's, the one she meant to be preserved.When I look at this book as a whole I can't help but wonder if Vincent was made into the person he wanted the world to know. But, at the same time, I don't know if we were properly \\"introduced\\". The answer is:","completion":"The given product review would most likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. There are several reasons for this assertion: 1. Slow pacing: The reviewer mentions that the book was \\"extremely slow going,\\" which implies that the narrative did not engage or hold their attention effectively. This could be viewed as a negative aspect for potential readers who prefer a faster-paced or more engaging story. 2. Lack of clarity and storytelling: The reviewer states that the book \\"asked too many questions and sort of implied the story rather than to tell it.\\" This suggests that the narrative might be confusing or difficult to follow, translating into an unsatisfactory reading experience for potential buyers. 3. Poor editing: The reviewer brings up the presence of \\"a variety of typos and errors,\\" which indicates a lack of attention to detail and proofreading during the publication process. This can be quite a frustration for readers who expect a polished and professionally edited work. 4. Misaligned focus: The reviewer believes that the author, Elizabeth Stone, focuses more on her own life than on Vincent's, who is supposed to be the main subject of the book. This could be disappointing for readers who are interested in learning more about Vincent's life and perspective. 5. Doubt over Vincent's portrayal: The reviewer questions whether Vincent was accurately and fairly represented in the book, expressing uncertainty about whether they were properly \\"introduced\\" to him. This might raise concerns among potential readers about the book's authenticity and the author's ability to capture the true essence of Vincent's story. Taking these factors into consideration, it is evident that this review would likely deter potential buyers from purchasing the product, as it highlights several significant shortcomings and disappointments regarding the book's content, editing, and overall presentation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He meets the teenage Ptolemy whom is frequently surrounced by an entourage of ministers and advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking and decision-making for him. As a gesture of 'goodwill', the Egyptians present Caesar with Pompey's severed head, but Caesar is not pleased; it is a sorry end for a worthy foe.As Caesar settles in at the palace, Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), disguised as a rug peddler, brings a gift from Cleopatra. When a suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued with the young queen's beauty and warm personality as she persuades him to help her take back her thrown from her younger brother.Days later, Cleopatra warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Caesar is unconcerned. He orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, burning many buildings, including the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to deal with the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar begins kissing her.The Romans hold the main gate to the city after a fierce nightime battle. The next day, the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil and drive off the armies of Ptolemy. The following day, Caesar passes judgment in a show trial.

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

Amy was too tired and fell asleep while reading..","completion":"Amy was too tired and fell asleep while reading. Amy had a long day, with the morning chores piling up. She left early to help out her best friend with some gardening in the morning before getting groceries and running errands. After that, she got back home to prepare a late lunch for the family. Once everybody was fed and cleaned up, Amy spent the afternoon packing Jessica's lunch for school as well as her husband's briefcase for work the following day. In the evening, Jessica came up to her mother and pleaded with her best puppy-dog-eyes to hear about the adventures of the Princess and the Magical Unicorn. Amy, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, switched on her warm and soothing mommy mode. Together, they went upstairs to Jessica's bright and cozy bedroom, which was decorated with soft fairy lights and dream-catchers swirling in the wind. The room had a beautiful lavender scent that filled the air and helped both mother and daughter relax after a long day. Amy picked the slightly worn out hardcover book from the shelf and opened it to the bookmark where they left off the previous night. With a mother's love, she gently tucked Jessica into the cozy duvet and let the soft light from the bedside lamp wash the pages of the storybook with a warm yellowish glow. The room was filled with a comfortable silence, interrupted only by the sound of the pages turning occasionally. Jessica snuggled into her bed, looking up at her mother expectantly as she waited for the story to unfold. Amy started reading, her voice lilting and mellifluous, painting the breathtaking Kingdom full of lush greenery and bright cotton-candy skies. The Princess was regal and benevolent, and her magical unicorn possessed a glittering rainbow tail, a shimmering horn and had an enchanted ability to talk. The enchanting tale continued, with the Princess and her magical unicorn going on a quest to save the Kindgom ruled by the captious Queen Morgana. Amy's dulcet voice swept Jessica away into the world of the story as they traveled due north to free the townspeople trapped behind a wall of ice and reveal Queen Morgana's enchantress sister, Luna. However, Amy's day started to take its toll on her. As the adventure intensified, her eyelids began to slowly droop, her voice becoming weaker and her words jumbled. Before she could continue her account of the hair-raising escape from an enchanted forest of petrified pillars, Amy felt herself succumbing to the tidal wave of exhaustion. Jessica noticed her mother's struggle to stay awake and stroked her arm affectionately. Soon, Amy stopped reading altogether and fell into a deep sleep in the warmth of her daughter's room, trying to maintain grip on the book. Jessica gave a soft smile, knowing that her mother had done her best. Gently, she reached out and took the book from Amy's limp fingers. She placed the bookmark carefully before setting the book down on the nightstand. After tucking her mother under a soft, plush throw blanket from the foot of her bed, Jessica whispered \\"I love you, Mom,\\" before switching off the bedside lamp.

He decided on a Options: (A). smoothie because it is creamier.. (B). milkshake because it is creamier..","completion":"The man couldn't decide on a smoothie or a milkshake. He decided on a milkshake because it is creamier (Option B). This decision was influenced by several factors that differentiate the two popular refreshing beverages in terms of texture, flavor, and nutritional content. Smoothies are typically made by blending fruits, vegetables, yogurt, and/or milk to create a beverage that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars. Smoothies are ideal for people looking for a healthier option to quench their thirst and satisfy their sweet tooth, as they often contain a balanced mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats. Moreover, smoothies are customizable in terms of ingredients, allowing for a wide range of flavor combinations and the ability to meet specific dietary needs. Milkshakes, on the other hand, are creamy concoctions made by blending milk with ice cream and flavored syrups. The extra air incorporated during the blending process, along with the thick, melted ice cream, gives milkshakes a velvety texture that is highly desirable to many consumers. Milkshakes are generally sweeter, denser, and higher in calories than smoothies, making them a decadent treat for those who wish to indulge. In this case, the man decided upon a milkshake due to its creamier consistency, which could offer several advantages. The texture is not only more pleasing to the palate for some people, but it can also feel more satiating and satisfying, making it a fulfilling choice for those looking to treat themselves. Furthermore, this rich and indulgent beverage is often served in restaurants as a dessert, providing a sense of indulgence and enjoyment that makes it a popular choice for many individuals. However, it is crucial to recognize that milkshakes may not be the best option for everyone, as their high fat, sugar, and overall calorie content may not align with specific dietary preferences or health goals. On the other hand, choosing a smoothie retains many of the same refreshing qualities and provides a greater level of nutritional value. Ultimately, though, the decision between a smoothie and a milkshake lies in personal preference, taking into account factors beyond just creaminess. An individual may need to consider their dietary goals, nutritional needs, desired flavor profile, and any allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients when making their choice. For the man in this scenario, his preference for the creamier, indulgent texture of the milkshake made it the better option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This train, set on its course, serviced as a vital link that connected various regions in the country was filled to its capacity with enthusiastic passengers, each graced with the prospect of spending their holidays with their loved ones, a joyous and special time of the year that was drastically turned upside down. The rather desolate scene that resulted from this incidence echoed chilling apprehensive murmurs about fatalities. Such a major rail accident has the potential to leave a substantial death toll, causing nation-wide sorrow and international concern. The scenes at the crash site were heart-wrenching as distraught family members harbored fear for their loved ones whose lives hung in the balance. Although the total number of casualties is yet to be confirmed, the high occupancy of the train and severity of the accident inevitably invokes the widespread fear about the number of deceased. Moreover, the severity of the derailment gives rise to a multitude of questions, fundamentally probing the state of rail transit safety standards in Pakistan. This tragic accident thus hammers home the imperative need for stringent regulation, regular and meticulous maintenance checks, and upgraded safety measures in Pakistan's rail transit system. As the investigation is underway, rescue crews are scrambling against time to pull trapped passengers from the mangled wreckage in an operation compounded by the remote location of the derailment. The authorities are also expected to launch a thorough investigation to identify the cause of the accident, which could range from mechanical failure, human error, or neglect of infrastructure, and seek to hold accountable any lapses which could have led to this catastrophe. For the bereaved families, it's a time of losing dear ones and grappling with an unreal & irreversible reality that their holiday joy abruptly ended in tragedy, equally daunting is the task for survivors coping with the traumatic experience and possibly life-altering injuries. The entire country, and beyond, shares in their profound sorrow, dismay, and shock. The international community is also urged to extend support in any way possible, be it through condolences, kind words, prayers, or tangible aid, to help the people of Pakistan bear this terrible loss. Ultimately, while we grieve and fear for the dead, such a tragic incident underscores the pressing necessity for stricter safety inspections, resilient infrastructures, well-maintained transport vehicles, thorough scrutiny in human operations, and enhanced promptness in rescue operations. It serves as a severe reminder that the safety of passengers, be it holiday travelers or daily commuters, should always be paramount, and no stone should be left unturned to ensure their safe journeys."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The now-scrapped plan was put in place to ensure that governors did not inadvertently express \\"things they don't mean\\" to the media. This decision has been applauded by mental health advocates and experts, who believe that open communication is vital in addressing the crisis of mental health service inadequacy in many regions. In this article, we will discuss the implications of this decision, its potential effects on the mental health trust's operation and how this move is a step in the right direction towards transparency and open dialogue in mental health care services. The Scrapped Plan: An Attempt at Damage Control The initial plan compelling governors to consult the trust before speaking to the media was designed as a damage control measure. Governors are considered to be the public face of a mental health trust, and as such, their statements have a powerful influence on the trust's reputation and public perception. Had this plan remained in place, it would have likely served as a barrier to open and honest communication, protecting the trust's image at the expense of genuine dialogue with stakeholders. Critics of the plan argued that it was an unwarranted restriction on freedom of speech and a lack of accountability on the part of the mental health trust. They expressed concerns that stifling the governors' voices could contribute to an environment of secrecy and opaqueness, making it even more challenging to address the trust's multiple issues. The Decision to Revoke the Plan: A Shift Towards Transparency The decision to withdraw the initial plan has been seen as an indication of the trust's willingness to be more transparent and embrace open communication. Mental health trusts play a crucial role in the mental health care system, and transparency is essential to ensuring effective interaction with stakeholders – including patients, mental health professionals, regulators, and the media. By revoking the plan, the trust demonstrates its commitment to establishing trust with these stakeholders, fostering an environment where challenges and shortcomings can be openly discussed and addressed. The Role of Open Dialogue in Mental Health Care Services There is no question that many mental health trusts are facing serious challenges, particularly in the context of funding limitations and increasing demand for quality mental health care services. Open dialogue plays an essential role in identifying these challenges and finding potential solutions. By encouraging governors to speak openly to the media and discuss the issues that mental health trusts are encountering, it becomes possible to raise public awareness and generate support for policy changes, funding, and resources needed to improve the mental health care system. A Step in the Right Direction The decision to scrap the plan requiring governors to consult the trust when speaking to the media is a positive move towards transparency and open dialogue in mental health care services. It reflects the trust's recognition that the most effective way to address challenges and improve mental health services is through open communication with stakeholders. The mental health care sector, both patients and professionals alike, will benefit from this renewed commitment to transparency. By embracing open dialogue, mental health trusts can work collaboratively with stakeholders, including the media, to raise awareness of mental health issues, improve services, and strive towards a more effective mental health care system. In conclusion, scrapping the controversial plan is an applaudable decision that signals a shift towards embracing openness and collaboration. Mental health trusts should continue to prioritize transparency, empowering their governors to speak candidly with the media and promoting open and honest communication regarding the challenges facing the mental health sector. It is through this commitment to open dialogue that mental health trusts can continue to make strides towards a more efficient, responsive, and patient-centered mental health care system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the character that is claimed to be hurting Bugs?, using the article: As Elmer has Bugs Bunny cornered on his hunting trip, Elmer receives a telegram from his Uncle Louie who leaves him 3 million in his will, as long as he doesn't harm any animals, especially rabbits. Elmer changes his tune to one of uncharacteristic niceness and sets Bugs free. Bugs, with characteristic élan, takes full advantage of the situation by sneaking into Elmer's house before Elmer returned and making himself at home. As Elmer returns, he hears Bugs singing \\"Angel in Disguise\\", while taking a shower and later shaving; Bugs uses the opportunity to purposely aggravate Elmer, knowing that he has Uncle Louie as blackmail and because of this Elmer cannot effectively punish Bugs in any way at the risk of losing his inheritance. Elmer tries to coax Bugs into leaving, gently patting him on the head, which Bugs claims that he is hurting him and threatens to call Uncle Louie. Elmer apologizes to Bugs then tricks him into walking out of the house. Bugs resorts to faking a serious illness, prompting Elmer to take him back in, afraid he may have lost the inheritance for good. Later a special delivery letter arrives for Elmer, which informs him that Uncle Louie has \\"kicked the bucket\\" and that he now inherits the 3 million. However, the amount of the various estate taxes, including a 2 million inheritance tax, claims the entirety of the inheritance and leaves Elmer owing Louie's lawyer 1.98. Furious at Bugs' torment and intrusion for all that, Elmer, at his wits' end and with nothing to lose, is finally free to vent his anger on Bugs and chases him around the house until Bugs escapes out the front door, to which Elmer slams shut. Elmer, briefly relieved that he is finally rid of Bugs, then receives a large Easter egg delivery from a postman.

Article: A ten-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan America is being hailed (...) a hero due to his persistence that led to saving the life of an elderly neighbor. The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad. That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer. Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up. Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Though still in hospital, the elderly woman is recovering well and grateful to Danny for his premonition. Question: When Danny Dipietro's mother found the elderly woman, the elderly woman _ .

Please answer the following question: This article: The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

In America, an estimated 32 million color-blind Americans--95% are males--can soon have their life improved. \\"DanKam takes the stream of data coming in through the phone's camera and changes the colors slightly so they fall within the range that people who are color-blind see,\\"developer Dan Kaminsky told CNET. He came up with the idea after watching the 2009 film Star Trek with a color-blind friend. It was then that he got to know more about colorblindness like its varying types and degrees. A vast majority, for instance, have trouble seeing red or green due to a genetic defect . Blue-yellow colorblindness, however, is rarer and develops later in life because of aging, illness or head injuries, etc. He started experimenting with one of the most common representations of points in the RGB color model. What the DanKam app attempts to do is to clean up the color space of the image or video signal so that colors can be _ to those suffering from viewing problems. \\"You can adjust the app to fit your needs.

They're so fragile even the players' breath risks nudging them out of tune. Turn up the temperature in the concert hall and you'd have, not a finely chiseled viola, flute or conga, but a glass of water. \\"And you'd be healthier for drinking it!\\" says Tim Linhart, ice-instrument maker extraordinaire to an orchestra playing a series of concerts throughout the winter in the remote Swedish town of Luleå, just beneath the Arctic Circle. Hearing is believing. Hearing really is believing when it comes to these evanescent instruments made -- bar the strings and other odd parts of metal or wood -- entirely from frozen water. Linhart has held ice concerts not only in Sweden over the past 15 years but also in far-flung locations from Beaver Creek, Colorado, to the Italian alps. His main problem, he says, in attracting a greater audience to the genre is people's incredulity that an ice instrument could make more than the most rudimentary sound. A recording of an ice violinist busking a solo classical piece outside Luleå's House of Culture in around -10 C is evidence to the contrary. The sound is sharp and ethereal, with a wide tonal range. Not only classical. But the ice repertoire doesn't include only refined, classical pieces. Along with the violins and a viola, cellos and a bass, there's an ice banjo in this year's lineup to accent country and bluegrass numbers. Six- and 12-string guitars suit rock 'n' roll, and an ice xylophone resting on bicycle inner tubes -- to aid its resonance -- works across the genres. As for the orchestra's gigantic spherical \\"bubble drums,\\" Linhart tells CNN, \\"they really shake your skeleton.\\" Doubtless they'll be deployed to funky effect in the -- inevitably, this being Sweden -- series of Abba-themed concerts among the 40 or so on the program this year. Winter pursuit. A stone sculptor in warmer months, the bearded Linhart, 53, makes all the instruments for the winter concerts in a six-week burst in his back garden. They're transported to a specially built igloo auditorium seating 170 people in a nature park outside Luleå, where the orchestra plays. Originally from New Mexico, Linhart was invited to this town of 80,000 residents in Swedish Lapland 10 years ago to take part in the building of one of the world's first ice hotels. He met his wife here. That's one reason he's stuck around, but no doubt it also helped that Luleå is one of the coldest towns in Sweden. Saving on its air con bills, Facebook is building its first server farm outside the United States in the town. Lovers of a cold climate. So, apart from loving a sub-zero climate, how else do ice instruments differ from the conventional kind? They're quicker to make, for a start, Linhart says. \\"I can do the carving on the front and back plate of a standup bass in two hours. \\"The chisel just glides through the ice. \\"My tools are similar to those of a regular instrument maker,\\" he says. But when it comes to sealing one of his creations together, \\"the only glue I use is water.\\" \\"If you want to glue a crack in an ice instrument, you just take a little straw, blow through it until the ice melts and then let it freeze again. \\"With wood, you can only carve. \\"With ice, you can also grow.\\" Just add water! Another difference from conventional instrument making? Linhart wears dishwashing gloves while he's carving, something you wouldn't see many master violin makers doing. Icy materials. The sculptor works mainly with \\"white ice,\\" a pearl-colored blend of water and snow that's especially flexible when frozen. Then there's clear ice: \\"Pure frozen water with no flaws, just molecule against molecule all the way through.\\" But it's harder to find. Northern Sweden is a good place to look, but you have to dig 20 centimeters beneath a lake surface to find the bubble-free stuff. Instruments wrought from either material are both more beautiful and more fragile than traditional instruments, Linhard says. What other instrument, he asks, lets the light shine through? Their unique visual qualities are exploited in the performances, when non-warming LEDs, constantly shifting in color, are placed inside the instruments. \\"It's like a nightclub in heaven,\\" Linhart says. Spring thaw. The instruments are exceedingly delicate. They melt in springtime and require constant maintenance before then. When played, the violins are suspended by strings from the ceiling to keep them from the musician's warm body. Just the breath from players and audience means every instrument has to be re-tuned slightly between each song. Such attention is worth it, says Linhart, for the exquisite sound these magical objects produce. \\"Ice instruments have a more detailed sound than wood, say, which absorbs the vibrations from the strings and dampens the sound,\\" he says. \\"Ice is stiffer. It picks up all the vibrations. \\"That's why it makes your hair stand on end. \\"You might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly clear -- until you hear an ice instrument and go, 'Ah ha!' \\"The clarity is crystal.\\" Flight plans. Up next on Linhard's icy agenda is an instrument dreamed up specifically for ice called the orgasmatron, after the machine in the Woody Allen film \\"Sleeper.\\" It's like a cello, but one a player bows from inside, making his or her body part of the sound. Linhart doesn't intend his ice-crafting career to end with instruments. His dream project is an ultralight airplane made from ice. Luckily, temperatures tends to get colder the higher you fly. Ice Music continues in Luleå until April 6. You can view the concert program at Icemusic.se. Tickets booked at Ticnet.se.

Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Ice instruments are among the rarest and most fragile in the world, with even a player's breath posing a risk of knocking them out of tune. Despite the challenges, Tim Linhart, an ice-instrument maker, has been organizing ice concerts in various locations, including the remote Swedish town of Luleå, for over 15 years. The instruments, which are made almost entirely from frozen water, can produce sharp, ethereal sounds with a wide tonal range. The ice repertoire isn't limited to classical pieces; it also includes country, bluegrass, and rock music. Linhart creates the instruments during a six-week period each year and uses them in winter concerts held in a specially constructed igloo auditorium. The ice instruments are more fragile but also more visually stunning than their traditional counterparts, with some allowing light to shine through. Performances often incorporate non-warming LED lights, which create an otherworldly atmosphere. Ice instruments offer a more detailed sound than those made of wood, which absorbs the vibrations produced by the strings and dampens the sound. In comparison, ice is stiffer and picks up all the vibrations, providing a clearer, crisper sound quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jack soon teaches Les and Jacobs some interesting lessons about how to sell papers (such as sensationalizing headlines).Shortly afterwards, the boys are challenged when the 'World' newspaper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall), raises their purchase rate by 1/10 of a cent. Though seemingly a drop in the bucket for Pulitzer (who hopes to use the added funds to keep competing with his closest competitor, William Randolph Hearst), the increase is a significant price gouge for the Newsies. With David supplying input and ideas, Jack becomes the leader of the group. The boys then go to other parts of New York to rally other newsboy groups, with Jack and David going to Brooklyn to recruit Spot Conlon (Gabriel Damon) and his group. Even with David's enthusiasm, Spot is still doubtul about joining them.At the same time, the boys catch the eye of Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman), a reporter for the 'New York Sun.' Denton soon becomes the boy's champion, making the 'Sun' the only newspaper in New York covering the newsboy strike.In one incident that gets Pulitzer's attention, the boys cause havoc at a newspaper distribution center, that calls the police to the scene. One of the newsboys, Crutchy (Marty Belafsky), is captured and taken to a place called 'The Refuge,' which is operated by Warden Snyder (Kevin Tighe). While told to be a place to rehabilitate young boys, it is actually a place where its keepers take advantage of the system, pocketing extra money for every boy they bring in, as well as not allowing the boys to partake in more nourishing food.

Japanese parents believe that the flags will bring their boys good luck and give them courage and power. May 5th is Japanese Children's Day. But since the festival is mainly celebrated by boys,it is usually called Boy's Day.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the representative of the 7th congressional district that includes the city that elected Jenny Durkan as mayor in 2017?, using the article: Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, it is not directly stated who the representative of the 7th congressional district is that includes the city that elected Jenny Durkan as mayor in 2017. This task would require additional research not available within the text. It's important to note that congressional representatives are separate from the mayoral role that Jenny Durkan held within Seattle's mayor–council form of government. Jenny Durkan was indeed elected as the mayor in 2017, taking office on November 28th that same year but her role does not clarify the representative of the 7th congressional district. However, if we look at the context clues in the article, it indicates that the city's political culture leans heavily liberal and progressive, with a significant part of the population voting for the Democratic Party. This could suggest that the representative in question could possibly be a Democrat. But, without additional information, it would not be accurate to determine the specific individual representing the 7th congressional district that includes Seattle. If you wanted to find out the name of the current or past representative of the 7th congressional district that includes Seattle, a good start would be to conduct a search along the lines of \\"Who is the representative of the 7th congressional district in Washington state?\\" or \\"Who was the representative of the 7th congressional district in Washington state in 2017?\\". This would help you find out who the representative of that congressional district was at that particular point in time. It's also crucial to bear in mind that congressional districts are defined on a state level, as opposed to being tied to a specific city or mayor. Congressional districts can encompass whole cities, parts of cities, or multiple cities based on geographical and population factors. Thus, the person holding the position of mayor, such as Jenny Durkan, does not necessarily directly influence or determine the congressional representative for their district. To summarize, the representative of the 7th congressional district that includes Seattle, where Jenny Durkan was elected mayor in 2017, cannot be determined from the text provided in the article. Additional research would be required to answer this question accurately and exhaustively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters.

Thaddeus's passion for the welfare of his people, combined with his innate talent for diplomacy, helped shape Galdarath into a prosperous nation that others aspired to emulate. Thaddeus was well-known for his open-mindedness and willingness to learn from the experiences and perspectives of others. From humble farmers to skilled artisans, he valued the wisdom of his people, as he believed that everyone had something valuable to contribute towards the betterment of his realm. His court was always bustling with people from all walks of life, eagerly discussing matters of the day and offering solutions to the challenges their community faced. Thaddeus's dedication to aiding his people extended far beyond listening to their concerns and engaging in lengthy conversations. He implemented a variety of progressive reforms aimed at reducing inequality, improving education, and providing better infrastructure for his subjects. His government offered financial assistance to those in need and encouraged the cultivation of new industries that could benefit the people and economy of Galdarath. It was during Thaddeus's reign that Galdarath became recognized as a center for arts and culture. Thaddeus sought to foster the talents of his people not only in the pursuit of economic prosperity but also in the realm of intellectual and artistic expression. He founded numerous schools and institutions that provided education and training for talented citizens, supporting their growth as individuals and enhancing the reputation of Galdarath as a vibrant, innovative kingdom. Thaddeus's policies and approach to governance also had a profound impact on the region's geopolitics. His ability to forge alliances and maintain good relations with neighboring countries helped to prevent costly conflicts and establish Galdarath as a trusted, reliable partner in international affairs. Distinguished foreign emissaries flocked to his court, drawn by the combination of his personal charisma and his kingdom's growing importance on the global stage. While many previous rulers had focused solely on the interests of their own kingdom, Thaddeus understood that peace and prosperity on the global scale were intertwined with Galdarath's well-being. This wisdom led him to promote international collaboration in areas such as technology, scientific research, and the shared preservation of natural resources. These initiatives helped to bolster Galdarath's status as a leading kingdom and fostered camaraderie among the nations that participated. Regrettably, Thaddeus's reign lasted for only a few years. The kingdom of Galdarath mourned the loss of their beloved ruler, who had become a symbol of hope and progress. While it is unclear exactly why Thaddeus's reign was cut short, his ideals and leadership style continued to inspire generations of rulers and commoners alike. The seeds he had planted during his time on the throne continued to bloom long after his passing, strengthening the legacy of Thaddeus the Commoner's King. In the years that followed, Galdarath rose to prominence as a shining example of what a just, prosperous, and forward-thinking kingdom could achieve. Stories of Thaddeus's deeds and his genuine love for his people became legends, passed down through generations. As a result, the name of Thaddeus the Commoner's King has been etched into the annals of history, serving as an enduring symbol of what a truly devoted leader can accomplish for the betterment of their people and the world at large."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jerusalem (CNN)President Barack Obama and U.S. officials were completely blindsided by the announcement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will come to Washington to address a joint session of Congress this spring -- a move that's rattled the White House and diplomatic officials. The announcement from House Speaker John Boehner's office this week came after several high-level interactions between U.S. and Israeli officials, including a phone call between Obama and Netanyahu and a multi-hour meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, a senior administration official told CNN. Netanyahu's snub has once again soured relations between the two world leaders, but U.S. officials insist the tensions won't affect U.S. support for Israel. Yet ahead of the elections, Netanyahu's visit may be a boon for him and his party in","completion":"Israel, as it allows him to demonstrate his close relationship with the United States and his ability to navigate political situations in Washington. Additionally, it offers Netanyahu an influential platform to address issues concerning Israel, including Iran's nuclear program and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. However, the unusual manner in which the visit was announced, and the resulting tensions between the Obama administration and Israeli officials, raises questions about the long-term implications of this development on U.S.-Israel relations. Firstly, it is important to examine the rationale behind Netanyahu's decision to accept Boehner's invitation to address Congress without first notifying the White House. One possible explanation is that the Israeli Prime Minister and his supporters in the U.S. Congress want to convey a strong message about their commitment to defending Israel's security interests, particularly given the ongoing negotiations between the P5+1 countries (including the U.S.) and Iran over its nuclear program. By framing his speech in such a high-stakes, high-profile context, Netanyahu might hope to influence the outcome of these negotiations in a direction that he perceives as more favorable to Israel's interests. Another potential factor motivating Netanyahu's decision could be domestic politics, as the visit is scheduled to take place just weeks before the Israeli elections on March 23, 2021. By showcasing his ability to engage with U.S. lawmakers and secure American support, Netanyahu might be attempting to boost his re-election chances by demonstrating his strengths as a leader capable of defending Israel's interests on the international stage. Notwithstanding these potential benefits for Netanyahu, there are significant risks involved in pursuing this course of action. By accepting Boehner's invitation without first consulting the Obama administration, the Israeli Prime Minister risks further straining an already tense relationship between the U.S. and Israel. This could have negative consequences for cooperation between the two countries in areas such as military aid, intelligence sharing, and diplomatic support on the global stage. Moreover, by appearing to align himself more closely with the Republican Party in the U.S., Netanyahu risks alienating key Democratic supporters of Israel. This could exacerbate partisan divisions over Israel in Congress and ultimately weaken the traditionally bipartisan consensus on maintaining a strong U.S.-Israel alliance. In conclusion, Netanyahu's decision to accept an invitation to address a joint session of Congress without notifying the Obama administration carries both potential rewards and significant risks. The visit might provide the Israeli Prime Minister with an opportunity to influence the outcome of the P5+1 negotiations with Iran and boost his re-election prospects at home. However, it also risks causing lasting damage to the U.S.-Israel relationship by further straining ties between the two leaders and deepening partisan divisions in Congress over support for Israel. Ultimately, the long-term implications of this move will depend on how both U.S. and Israeli officials decide to navigate the complicated diplomatic terrain that this development has created."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - \`\` Stellar Ships '' or \`\` Star Ships '' ( Russian name \`\` Zvezdnye Korabli '' , Russian : ) is a short story by the Soviet writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov written in 1944 and first published in 1948 in the USSR . This story is about the discovery of an ancient dinosaur bone with a mysterious bullet hole ( or \`\` blaster hole '' ) and an alien skull and his portrait nearby . This acts as a starting point and a cover story to the philosophical idea of plurality of the mind cradles in the Universe , similarity of planet evolution paths , and similarity of physiology and psychology . Efremov states the final perspective for all civilisations is The Great Circle , which will unite them all . - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Ivan Antonovich (real patronymic Antipovich) Yefremov (April 22, 1908 October 5, 1972), last name sometimes spelled Efremov, was a Soviet paleontologist, science fiction author and social thinker. He originated taphonomy, the study of fossilization patterns. - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

Marcel Proust (1871-1922) was a French novelist, critic, and essayist. He is best known for his monumental work, \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" (also known as \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\"), a novel written in seven volumes between 1913 and 1927. In this work, along with other writings, Proust has referenced and written about Chopin, his music, and the impact of the composer on society. Proust's sensitive appreciation of musical aesthetics is evident in his writing and he often mentioned the significance of Chopin as a composer in his character's lives. André Gide (1869-1951) was another influential French author, who wrote novels, essays, and plays. He was a prominent figure in French literature during his time and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947. Gide also wrote about Chopin and was fascinated by the composer's life and work. In his book \\"Notes on Chopin,\\" Gide elaborated on Chopin's compositions, the importance of his music, and Chopin's extraordinary life as an artist. Moreover, the statement also mentions that Chopin has featured in the works of German expressionist writer Gottfried Benn (1886-1956) and Nobel Prize-winning Russian author Boris Pasternak (1890-1960), highlighting Chopin's extensive impact on the literary world beyond France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese New Year Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival in modern China, is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. It is one of several Lunar New Years in Asia. Celebrations traditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first calendar month. The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20 In 2018, the first day of the Lunar New Year was on Friday, 16 February, initiating the year of the Dog. Is this statement correct \\"can chinese new year fall on valentines day\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"Can Chinese New Year fall on Valentine's Day?\\" is theoretically correct, although the likelihood is quite rare. It is important first to understand that Chinese New Year, as mentioned earlier, is a festival that marks the beginning of the new year according to the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the solar year, causing the date of the Chinese New Year to vary, falling between January 21 and February 20 on the Gregorian calendar. Valentine's Day, on the other hand, is celebrated on February 14 on the Gregorian calendar, which is a fixed date. Now, to answer the question, it is technically possible for Chinese New Year to fall on February 14 if the new moon aligns with that date, making it coincide with Valentine's Day. However, this occurrence is quite rare, and in recent history, Chinese New Year has not fallen on Valentine's Day. In the next few decades, based on astronomical predictions, no instance of Chinese New Year falling on February 14 is expected. Despite the low probability, the possibility shouldn't be entirely dismissed in an extended timeline.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what contains genetic instructions?\\" is \\"cows\\", given that cells contain genetic instructions? Answer:","completion":"While it is true that cells contain genetic instructions, the answer \\"cows\\" may not be the most appropriate or accurate answer to the question \\"what contains genetic instructions?\\" The reason for this is that cows, being a specific organism, are too narrow of an answer and do not encompass the broad range of organisms and entities that contain genetic instructions. Instead, a more comprehensive and informative answer would be DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The genetic instructions within living organisms are primarily stored in their DNA. DNA is the genetic blueprint for life, as it contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive, and reproduce. It achieves this by storing biological information in the form of a genetic code, which is composed of sequences of four chemical bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The genetic code within DNA is divided into functional units called genes, which are responsible for producing unique proteins or RNA molecules that carry out specific functions within cells. The total collection of genes in an organism is referred to as its genome. Additionally, DNA is found in the cell nuclei of eukaryotes, which include animals, plants, and fungi, and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea. Although cows, as living organisms, do indeed contain cells with genetic instructions in the form of DNA, they are just one example of the countless species that possess this crucial biological element. Therefore, the most accurate and all-encompassing answer to the question \\"what contains genetic instructions?\\" would be DNA, since it is applicable to all organisms that carry genetic information, including cows but not limited to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

L'exemple le plus parlant et le plus récent de la manière dont la violence engendre une violence encore plus forte est l'attaque contre les bureaux de l'ONU à Bagdad. Translate to English","completion":"The most striking and recent example of how violence begets even stronger violence is the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad. The attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, took place on August 19, 2003. This tragic event resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's Special Representative in Iraq, and the injuring of many more. The organization's offices were targeted by a suicide bomber, who detonated a truck packed with explosives near the building. This devastating act of violence, carried out during a period of instability and ongoing conflict in the country, highlighted the harsh reality that violence often leads to more significant and intense violent reactions. In the case of the UN attack in Baghdad, the repercussions of this destructive incident were felt both in the country and across the international community. The conflict in Iraq began with the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, which aimed to overthrow then-leader Saddam Hussein. Violence and chaos quickly ensued, primarily stemming from sectarian divisions between the Sunni and Shia populations, as well as from the presence of various foreign military forces in the country. Following the invasion, Iraq became a breeding ground for extremist and terrorist groups, leading to brutal acts of violence directed at both the country's citizens and international organizations present in the region. When examining the aftermath of the UN headquarters attack in Baghdad, there are several ways in which the violence of this act spawned even stronger examples of violence within the country and among the international community. Firstly, the bombing deepened the ongoing mistrust and tensions within Iraq, leading to an increase in sectarian conflict between the various ethnic and religious groups. This rift within the population resulted in further violence and devastating loss of life throughout the country, a situation that continues to plague Iraq to this day. Secondly, the attack on the United Nations offices sparked greater concerns and scrutiny from the international community. The bombing was a direct assault on an international symbol of diplomacy and peacekeeping, highlighting the serious threat extremist groups posed not only to Iraq but also to other countries and international bodies. This increased international focus on the situation in Iraq led various countries to escalate their military presence and operations in the region, which in turn fueled more violence and unrest. Lastly, the devastating attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad had ramifications on humanitarian efforts within Iraq. The United Nations and other non-governmental organizations were forced to re-evaluate their presence and security measures in the country, with many choosing to reduce their staff and operations in the face of increasing risk. This reduction in humanitarian support and resources had dire consequences for the Iraqi people, who were already facing immense challenges in the wake of the invasion and subsequent conflict. In conclusion, the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad serves as a stark example of the way in which violence often leads to even more potent forms of violence and suffering. In this case, the initial act of violence in the form of a brutal suicide bombing incited further conflict, international intervention and an overall climate of fear and distrust. The repercussions of this tragic event continue to reverberate throughout Iraq and shape the ongoing efforts towards peace and stability in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block. Question: \\"How long after opening his workshop did Durer did he create The Men's Bath House?\\" Answer: \\"1 year\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct.

Given the question: Question: What does someone committing perjury likely to have? Choices: - miscarriage of justice - guilt - testify - lies - truth The rationale to choose \\"guilt\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"Guilt The rationale to choose \\"guilt\\" as the answer to the question \\"What does someone committing perjury likely to have?\\" comes from understanding the definition of perjury and how it applies in a legal context. Perjury is the act of willfully and knowingly providing false information, especially while under oath in a legal proceeding. To commit perjury, a person must intentionally deceive by telling a lie or making a misleading statement. Considering the given choices: 1. Miscarriage of justice: While perjury can lead to a miscarriage of justice, the act of committing perjury itself does not necessarily mean that someone is causing a miscarriage of justice. It is the potential result or consequence of perjury rather than the state or feeling that the person committing perjury has. 2. Guilt: In this context, guilt refers to the state of being responsible for an offense or wrongdoing - in this case, the act of perjury. As the person committing perjury is knowingly providing false information, they are guilty of the offense of perjury. 3. Testify: To testify means to give evidence as a witness in a legal proceeding, which is not directly related to what someone committing perjury is likely to have. It is rather an action that the person might take while possibly committing perjury. 4. Lies: While someone committing perjury is indeed telling lies, the choice of \\"guilt\\" aligns more closely with the nature of the question. The question is seeking the consequence or state related to committing perjury, which is the guilt associated with that act, rather than the act of lying itself. 5. Truth: This choice is not applicable, as someone committing perjury is intentionally providing false information and not the truth. Given the context of the question, \\"guilt\\" emerges as the most suitable answer because a person committing perjury is likely to have guilt associated with their act of providing false information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Tara Brady PUBLISHED: 05:16 EST, 18 February 2013 | UPDATED: 06:49 EST, 18 February 2013 A Mexican church has set up a traffic light warning system for worshippers where a red light means someone is being shot outside. Violence now dominates Monterrey, Mexico's wealthiest and third largest city in Nuevo Leon state, which is beset by shootouts and armed robberies. A culture of fear is now so widespread that St Teresa of Avila Church adopted the traffic light system to warn worshippers if danger is near. Warning: A Catholic priest gives Holy Communion to a member of the congregation as a green light is lit inside St Teresa of Avila church indicating it is safe outside The capital region had been largely spared the widespread drug violence that grips parts of","completion":"Mexico, but in recent years, the situation has worsened. As a response, the St Teresa of Avila Church installed a traffic light warning system within its premises. The system includes three colored lights: green, indicating it's safe to exit the church; yellow, cautioning worshippers to be cautious when leaving, and red, warning that the situation outside is unsafe due to active shooting or criminal activity. Priests and churchgoers alike have tried to remain steadfast in their faith despite the ever-present threat, demonstrating the strength of their community. However, the implementation of the traffic light system at St Teresa's brought both local and international attention to the ongoing violence in Monterrey, prompting the local government and law enforcement agencies to take more decisive action against the rising crime rates. Working together, local authorities and citizens' groups engage in a rigorous battle against drug cartels and the crime associated with them. They strengthen law enforcement, fund rehabilitation programs for addicts, and improve social support initiatives aimed at preventing the youth from falling into the hands of crime syndicates. As the months go by, the collaborative efforts between citizens and authorities start to pay off. The crime rate in Monterrey begins to decrease, making the streets safer. The traffic light system at St Teresa's hardly ever shows a red light, and people once again start gathering at the church without the constant fear for their lives. Church leaders and worshippers alike credit the unyielding strength of their faith and community for overcoming the adversity that violence brought upon Monterrey. While the battle against crime continues, and occasional incidents still occur, the traffic light system serves as a symbol of both the resilience of the community and the power of collective action to effect change. The story of St Teresa of Avila Church does not end with a definite conclusion; instead, it serves as a reminder that fighting back against violence and fear takes a united effort. It also shows the power of faith to help communities remain strong in the face of danger and adversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: First impressions are usually formed within 30 seconds. The first thing an employer will notice is your physical appearance. Pick a wardrobe that communicates effort and professionalism. Research the company's dress code going into the interview. If you know anyone from the company, ask them what's appropriate. You can also call the company's Human Resource Department and ask what is recommended in terms of attire. If you're interviewing for a professional, managerial, or executive position you should always wear a suit. Have a few interview suits, preferably tailored to your body, on hand to choose from. If the attire is business casual, or if you're applying for a lower ranking position, a nice blouse with dress pants or a skirt is a good choice for women. Men can wear dress pants and a button down shirt and tie. If this is for a factory, construction, or other such job where you will get dirty, wear sensible attire to the interview, this includes steel-toed safety shoes and if it's a construction site, you'll need to wear a hard hat (not a bump hat) to get from the gate to the office. Do not forget footwear. Oftentimes, an outfit is great but shoes are tattered or worn. Invest in comfortable, work-appropriate shoes. Do not fret if you have to pay a little more. Remember, you will use these shoes often when you land a job. Avoid perfumes and other fragrances, which can appear tacky and put off interviewers. While accessories, like a nice belt or tasteful jewelry, can be a nice touch avoid anything overly flashy or distracting. If you wear make-up, stick to neutral shades of lipstick, eye-liner, and eye shadow. Your make-up should ideally enhance your existing facial features without overwhelming them. Never go into an interview without prior knowledge of the company. This conveys a lack of interest and respect on your part. Conduct thorough research in the days leading up to an interview. Know what skills the company values. Look at the career page on their website and pay close attention to the desired qualifications listed on their job postings. This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a given company and discover what aspects of your skill set and career history to emphasize. Read up on the latest news involving the company. Oftentimes, company websites have a section dedicated to press releases and news coverage. You can also search for the company's name in Google News. Research the company's mission and values. You'll want to make sure you come off as a good fit for the company's culture. There should be a section on the company's website with a mission statement. You can also follow the company on social media to get a sense of their ethos. Find out who your interviewer will be. Oftentimes, this is disclosed in the email asking you to come in for an interview. If not, you can politely request their name. Research the interviewer on LinkedIn and Twitter. This increases your chance of connecting and, in turn, landing the job. Concrete is better than abstract when it comes to wowing an interviewer. You should have a few solid anecdotes prepared that speak to your experience. People tend to remember stories easier than direct information. Therefore, telling a story rather than simply conveying your experience means you'll stand out in an interviewer's mind. Ask yourself, what are the skill sets this company is looking for? Write down a list of skills and, from there, try to come up with stories from past jobs, volunteer experiences, and internships that illustrate your proficiency with said skills. Have 2 to 3 anecdotes to choose from going in. Rehearse. Recite the stories to yourself to make sure you include all necessary information and don't slip up or stutter during the interview. You can always record yourself speaking and play back the recording to see where you need to improve. It's not uncommon for employers to scan the Twitter and Facebook accounts of potential employees. Make sure your social media presence is clean before going into an interview. Curse words do not reflect well on you as a potential employee. Make sure any obscenity is removed. A negative attitude can be a deterrent to employment and people often take to Twitter and Facebook to complain. Delete tweets or statues that air grievances about friends, family members, or businesses. If you want to err on the side of caution, you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook or Twitter profile the week before your interview. You can also change privacy settings so only certain posts are visible to the public. Summary:","completion":"When going to a job interview, it's important to look nice and know about the company. Wear clothes that show you are serious about the job and make sure your shoes are clean. Don't wear too much makeup, perfume, or flashy things. Learn about the company by looking at their website and news. Practice talking about things you have done that show you have the skills they want. Make sure your social media pages, like Facebook and Twitter, have only good things on them so the company likes you more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Christopher is an extrovert.; [b]. Aaron is an extrovert.;","completion":"The sentence ends as follows: Christopher taught Aaron how to ask a girl to homecoming without failure as Christopher is an extrovert. This choice (option [a]) is the more logical ending for the sentence, as it provides a clear explanation for why Christopher has the necessary skills and insights to be able to teach Aaron about successfully asking someone to homecoming. Being an extrovert typically indicates that a person is outgoing, sociable, and comfortable in various social situations. This likely means that Christopher has experience with interacting with people, particularly in the context of events like homecoming. Christopher's extroverted nature suggests that he has a strong understanding of how to approach and communicate with others, as well as a natural ability to navigate social dynamics. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that his extroverted qualities have allowed him to effectively approach and ask girls to homecoming events without experiencing rejection or failure. In turn, he can effectively share his knowledge, experience, and social skills with Aaron, who may be less experienced or less confident in these situations. On the other hand, if the sentence were to end with \\"Aaron is an extrovert\\" (option [b]), the logical connection between the two characters and the skill being taught would be less straightforward. If Aaron were already an extrovert, it would not clearly explain why he needed Christopher's help to ask a girl to homecoming without failure. He would likely already possess the necessary social skills and confidence to approach the girl on his own. In this case, mentioning Aaron's extroverted nature would not provide a strong basis or justification for Christopher's assistance in teaching him about asking someone to homecoming. In conclusion, the more suitable and coherent ending for the sentence is \\"Christopher taught Aaron how to ask a girl to homecoming without failure as Christopher is an extrovert.\\" This choice provides a clear explanation for the source of Christopher's expertise in the matter, as well as the reason behind his ability to effectively guide Aaron through the process of asking a girl to homecoming without failure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first sentence (\\"you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day\\") suggests that the speaker is experiencing some benefits from an unspecified activity that they wouldn't receive if they were confined to the house all day. The phrase \\"cooped up in the house all day\\" implies that the speaker is spending the majority of their time indoors and is not able to go outside as much as they would like to. The second sentence (\\"I get out of the house often\\") clearly states that the speaker is able to leave their home frequently. This sentence suggests that the speaker is not confined to their house and has ample opportunities to be outside and engage in various activities.

Color of the ball: The first statement specifies that the ball is blue, while the second statement does not mention the color of the ball. Therefore, we cannot assume the ball is blue based on the information provided in the second statement alone. 2. Size of the ball: In the first statement, the ball is described as large, while in the second statement it is called big. While these words have similar meanings, they could still describe slightly different sizes or be a subjective comparison. It is not guaranteed that they are describing the same ball. 3. Current action of the toddler: The first statement has the toddler holding the ball, while the second statement has the toddler preparing to throw the ball. While both statements mention a toddler with a ball, the actions they are performing with the ball are different. 4. Location of the toddler: The first statement clearly states that the toddler is playing in the grass, whereas the second statement only provides the information that the toddler is playing outside. There are various outside locations other than grassy areas where the toddler could be playing, such as on a sidewalk, in a sandbox, or on a patio.

There are several issues with the structure and word choice that would need to be corrected to achieve proper grammaticality. Some of the issues present in the sentence are: 1. Missing auxiliary verb: In the first clause, the verb \\"have\\" is used without a necessary auxiliary verb such as \\"to\\" or \\"should,\\" which is required to form a correct verb phrase. A potential correction could be to use \\"to have\\" or \\"should have\\" instead. 2. Incorrect verb form: The verb \\"eaten\\" following \\"have\\" is the past participle form, which should be used after an auxiliary verb like \\"has\\" or \\"had.\\" In its current form, a linguist would find this usage incorrect. Depending on the intended meaning, the appropriate verb form should be used. For example, \\"Mary claimed that Holly has eaten cabbage\\" or \\"Mary claimed that Holly had eaten cabbage.\\" 3. Unclear referent: The phrase \\"Holly should\\" at the end of the sentence is ambiguous, as it is unclear what action Holly should perform. A more explicit construction would improve clarity, such as stating the action explicitly, e.g., \\"Holly should also eat cabbage.\\" Taking these issues into account, a linguist might suggest revising the sentence to something like: \\"Mary claimed that Holly should have eaten cabbage\\" or \\"Mary claimed that, since she has eaten cabbage, Holly should too.\\" The revised sentences are grammatically correct and convey a clear meaning. In summary, the original sentence \\"Mary claimed that have eaten cabbage, Holly should\\" is not considered a valid English sentence grammatically. After addressing the issues related to the auxiliary verb, verb form, and unclear referent, a revised sentence would be more acceptable to a linguist in terms of grammaticality and clarity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"In that respect, the SEC should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions, its use of criminal statutes, and working effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The SEC does not need to change civil sanctions.\\"?","completion":"If the premise suggests that the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions, its use of criminal statutes, and work effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate, it implies that there might be certain inadequacies or inefficiencies in the current approach. Consequently, this premise challenges the hypothesis that \\"The SEC does not need to change civil sanctions.\\" The SEC is responsible for ensuring transparency, efficiency, and fairness in the securities market, and its regulatory powers include imposing civil sanctions, which are monetary penalties, on market participants who violate the federal securities laws. The premise addresses three crucial aspects of the SEC enforcement process: 1. Civil Sanctions: By suggesting a reexamination of the amount and targeting of civil sanctions, the premise raises concerns about whether current civil sanctions are effective in deterring securities law violations. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of reassessing the appropriateness and proportionality of these sanctions. For instance, the SEC could enforce more severe penalties for more egregious violations and consider factors such as the financial capacity of the violators and the harm caused to investors while determining the amount of the penalty. 2. Use of Criminal Statutes: The premise also touches upon the SEC's need to evaluate its reliance on criminal statutes as a deterrent mechanism. Since criminal charges can lead to incarceration and severe financial penalties, they can serve as a powerful deterrent. However, invoking criminal statutes excessively may also create unintended consequences, such as generating a chilling effect on the market or discouraging businesses from settling with the SEC. Thus, it is crucial for the SEC to strike a balance between using criminal statutes and civil sanctions to achieve its regulatory objectives. 3. Collaboration with the Department of Justice: Effective collaboration between the SEC and the Department of Justice (DOJ) is necessary to ensure that securities laws are enforced consistently and violators are held accountable when they engage in criminal activities. The premise suggests that the SEC needs to improve its cooperation with the DOJ in order to impose the appropriate penalties on market participants who commit securities fraud or manipulate markets. This includes better coordination, sharing of information, and a clear delineation of responsibilities between the two agencies to optimize their efforts in enforcing securities laws. Given these concerns raised by the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis \\"The SEC does not need to change civil sanctions\\" is contradicted. Rather, the premise indicates that reassessing the current civil sanctions regime, enhancing coordination with the DOJ, and finding a balanced approach to using criminal statutes are essential steps for the SEC to improve its enforcement efforts and deter securities law violations more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Blanch was lying down when she got sunburn OPT: - Yes; - It's impossible to say; - No;","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Blanch was lying down when she got sunburn from the given context. This conclusion can be reached based on several elements within the text: 1. Blanch put on her bikini, which suggests that she intended to sunbathe or spend time outdoors in the sunlight. 2. She laid out in the sun, indicating that she positioned herself in an area where she would be directly exposed to sunlight, most likely in a reclined or lying position. 3. She accidentally fell asleep, further supporting the idea that she was in a comfortable, lying-down position while in the sun. 4. She woke up with a sunburn, which means that she was exposed to the sunlight long enough for her skin to become sunburned. This would likely have resulted from her remaining in the lying-down position during her unintentional nap.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

The final major piece of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was to hit just after midnight, completing a ring of crater-like plumes of swirling superheated gas and debris thousands of miles across. \\"It hit Jupiter like a string of machine-gun bullets\\" said Eugene Shoemaker, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., who helped discover the comet last year. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Shoemaker-Levy comet hit Jupiter. Select from the following. a). yes. b). no.","completion":"a). Yes As stated in the text, the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet did hit Jupiter. The comet was fragmented into multiple pieces, with the final major piece hitting around midnight according to the given scenario. The impact was likened to the firing of a string of machine-gun bullets by Eugene Shoemaker, indicating the violent nature of the event. Let's further elaborate on this meteoric phenomenon and the significance of it: Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, discovered by astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy, is famous for its spectacular collision with the gas giant Jupiter in 1994. This event held great significance for astronomers as it marked the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. The Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet, originally estimated to be about 1.5 to 3 kilometers in diameter, fragmented into 21 visible pieces due to Jupiter’s strong tidal forces during a close approach in 1992. These fragments, nicknamed \\"string of pearls\\" because of their appearance, were on a collision course with Jupiter and hit the planet over a period of 6 days. The impacts, visible from Earth-based telescopes, created plumes of superheated gas and debris, marking Jupiter with a ring of dark spots that were thousands of miles across. These impacts provided astronomers precious information about the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as the structure of the comet itself. The extreme velocity of the impacts, estimated to be around 60 km/second, generated a great amount of energy, with the largest fragment yielding an explosion equivalent to six million mega tons of TNT (for comparison, the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an output of about 15 kilotons of TNT). These events put comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the map as one of the most studied comets in history, providing unprecedented data about comets and impact events, furthering our understanding of the dynamics of our solar system. Indeed, the statement that the Shoemaker-Levy comet hit Jupiter is in perfect alignment with the preceding text."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Start by thinking of the letter \\"b\\" as a special hidden number we're trying to find. And we have it on both sides of the equals sign, don't we? Let's simplify this, like when we tidy up our toys. So, first let's gather all terms with \\"b\\" on one side of the equals sign and the other numbers on the other side. Let's subtract 135*b from both sides of the equation. If you subtract something on one side of the balance, you need to subtract the same thing on the other side to keep it even. So equation will become: 8389 = 879*b - 135*b - 46667. Subtracting 879*b - 135*b gives 744*b, so you have: 8389 = 744*b - 46667. Then, let's move that 46667 over to the other side, by adding 46667 to both sides of the equation. That keeps it balanced. This simplifies to: 8389 + 46667 = 744*b. If you add those together, you get 55056 = 744*b. Our last step to find what \\"b\\" is is to divide 55056 by 744. This is just like splitting a whole bunch of candies evenly into bags. So, \\"b\\" equals 55056 divided by 744. If you do the math, \\"b\\" turns out to be about 74. And that's it!

Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday. The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems. Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of \`\`semi-starvation.''

Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born. Question: suppose during pollination happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The process of pollination, when applied to the life cycle of butterflies, has a significant effect on the growth of their population. It ultimately results in more butterflies being born. To understand how this occurs, it's essential to delve into the role butterflies play in pollination and its connection to their life cycle. Butterflies hold a crucial role in the process of pollination, as they are efficient pollinators, carrying pollen from one flower to another while seeking nectar. Nectar is a primary source of sustenance for butterflies and provides the energy and nutrients they need to lay their eggs. When butterflies pollinate more flowers, it not only increases the chances of fertilization and seed production in the plants but also boosts the availability of nectar for butterflies. This increase in nectar availability ensures a reliable food source for adult butterflies and supports an environment that is more suitable for egg deposition and survival of the subsequent caterpillars. During the butterfly life cycle, the caterpillars feed on different plants called host plants. A successful pollination event would increase the abundance of these host plants, allowing for an increase in food sources for the caterpillars. This would improve their chances of survival and growth until they can form cocoons, transform into pupae, and hatch into adult butterflies. So, examining the life cycle of a butterfly and its role in pollination, we can observe that an increase in pollination events positively affects the butterfly population in several ways: 1. More nectar is available for adult butterflies, providing them with the necessary energy to mate and lay eggs. 2. A higher abundance of host plants for caterpillars ensures a stable food source, allowing them to grow bigger before entering the cocoon stage. 3. A healthy environment with plentiful host plants also decreases predation and competition, leading to more caterpillars reaching the pupa stage and eventually becoming adult butterflies. Thus, the supposed perturbation of increased pollination ultimately influences the second effect mentioned (the caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger) positively, leading to more butterflies being born as a result. In conclusion, increasing pollination has a direct and positive effect on the butterfly population as it enhances the availability of food for both adult butterflies and caterpillars and supports a thriving ecosystem where more caterpillars can successfully transform into butterflies. This results in the birth of more butterflies in the wild."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: The coast? I asked, puzzled. Hypothesis: The coast made perfect sense. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis, \\"The coast made perfect sense,\\" is not directly entailed by the premise, \\"The coast? I asked, puzzled.\\" To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first analyze both statements and their relationship to each other. In the premise, the speaker is questioning the mention of the coast and expressing puzzlement or confusion. This suggests that, at least initially, the idea of the coast does not make perfect sense to the speaker. The premise serves as an introduction of the coast as a potential topic of discussion, and it does not provide specific context or information on why the coast may or may not make sense. The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the coast made perfect sense. This statement is more of a conclusion rather than a component of the premise itself. In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, there should be additional context or information provided in the premise or between the premise and hypothesis that reveals a logical progression from the initial puzzlement to an understanding of why the coast makes perfect sense. Therefore, based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise merely presents the confusion or puzzlement of the speaker and does not imply any specific outcome or realization. It is entirely possible that further discussion or context could lead to the speaker understanding why the coast makes perfect sense, but that is not provided in the premise alone. To conclude, the hypothesis \\"The coast made perfect sense,\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"The coast? I asked, puzzled,\\" as there is no direct logical progression between the two statements. There may be potential circumstances where the hypothesis could be true after further investigation, but it is not inherently entailed or guaranteed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the hypothesis, we are asked to conclude if a woman is carrying a poodle across the street in the same situation. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. Upon comparing the given premise to the hypothesis, we observe that the information about the man in a suit with a briefcase does not provide any direct information about a woman carrying a poodle across the street.

Kev: no, today is too soon What was going on in that conversation?","completion":"In this conversation, Kev and Rachel are discussing Kev's current state of mind and suggesting possible activities. 1. Kev initially expresses a lack of motivation or unwillingness to engage in any activity. This showcases Kev's current mindset of perhaps feeling tired, bored, or lacking enthusiasm. 2. Despite their lack of motivation, Kev mentions considering working on the computer. This suggests that Kev may still be open to participating in less physically demanding or more familiar activities, as using the computer is a common and often passive pastime. 3. Rachel proposes going to the gym as an alternative to Kev's plan of working on the computer. This suggestion implies that Rachel is concerned about Kev's well-being and wants them to participate in more active and potentially more beneficial activities that may help improve their mood or physical health. 4. Rachel asks if Kev can go to the gym today, emphasizing her interest in having Kev engage in a proactive and healthy activity in the immediate future. 5. Kev responds that going to the gym is too soon for today. This statement could mean that Kev is not yet ready or willing to take on the physical effort required for a gym visit. This could be due to Kev feeling overwhelmed, tired, or simply not being in the mood for exercise. Kev's response also implies that they might consider going to the gym at a later time, but not today. Overall, this conversation revolves around Kev's unmotivated state and the suggestions from Rachel to engage in activities that could potentially boost their energy or mood. Rachel's concern for Kev's well-being is evident through her suggestions and questions, while Kev remains unenthused and resistant to engaging in more physical activities like going to the gym."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Jane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \\"typical\\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \\"Madame La Comtesse\\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of First Impressions, the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially. Jane returns home and soon learns that Tom has...

Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers.

The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state.

Write an article based on this \\"Mental health patients having to travel as far as 79 miles (127km) for a bed is \\"not acceptable\\", the charity Mind has said.\\"","completion":"Title: Mental Health Patients Forced to Travel Long Distances for Treatment: A Call for Change Step 1: Provide background information To begin drafting the article, I will provide essential background information about the issue presented by the charity Mind, which reports that mental health patients are having to travel up to 79 miles (127km) for a bed. This will give readers a clear understanding of the problem at hand. The mental healthcare system has long been under strain due to the growing number of people needing support and treatment in many parts of the world. Access to quality mental healthcare services is of paramount importance for those suffering from psychological disorders, but lack of resources and inadequate infrastructure has made receiving timely care difficult for many. Recently, the charity Mind has highlighted an alarming issue—mental health patients are being forced to travel up to 79 miles (127km) to access inpatient treatment. Step 2: Discuss the implications of long-distance travel on mental health patients Next, I will discuss the potential consequences of long-distance travel on mental health patients, focusing on the emotional toll and barriers to treatment it may create. The need for patients to travel such considerable distances for treatment creates multiple barriers. For many individuals, the emotional stress of leaving their family and support network can exacerbate their symptoms, making the journey to receive treatment an agonizing experience. Furthermore, the financial burden of travel and accommodation may be prohibitive for many seeking help, leading to a delay in receiving critical care. Step 3: Present Mind's statement and stance on the issue After discussing the implications of long-distance travel, I will present the charity Mind's statement on the issue and their stance regarding the problem. Mind, a leading mental health charity, has called the current situation \\"not acceptable.\\" The organization argues that the lack of available beds in local facilities is representative of a broader problem within the mental healthcare system, where the needs of patients are not being adequately met. Ensuring that inpatient treatment is available closer to home could limit the detention of patients under the Mental Health Act and, in turn, lead to quicker recovery times and improved access to support services for patients and families. Step 4: Highlight potential solutions to address the issue Finally, I will discuss some potential solutions that could address the problem, emphasizing the need for systemic reform within the mental healthcare sector. To address the issue of mental health patients having to travel long distances for treatment, a multifaceted approach is required. Governments and local healthcare providers must invest in more inpatient beds to accommodate the needs of their communities. Additionally, it is crucial to strengthen community mental health programs, particularly in underfunded and underserved areas. By providing more comprehensive outpatient services, patients may be less likely to need inpatient care. Lastly, addressing the root causes of mental health issues through education, stigma reduction, and promotion of overall well-being may help reduce the strain on the entire mental health system. In conclusion, the harrowing experiences of mental health patients travelling long distances for essential treatment highlights an urgent need for reform within the mental healthcare system. By investing in resources, infrastructure, and community support, we can create a more compassionate and effective approach to mental health care that benefits all those in need."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary. His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it. He was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.

Information: - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Mek We Dweet is a studio album by Jamaican reggae singer Burning Spear . It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991 . - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Winston Rodney OD (born 1 March 1945), better known by the stage name Burning Spear, is a Jamaican roots reggae singer and musician. Burning Spear is a Rastafarian and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s. - Mento is a style of Jamaican folk music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music. - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.

He worked at home in the mornings, on illustrations, stage designs, book reviews and any other commissions, before joining his wife for a midday dry martini and finally dressing and going to one of his clubs for lunch. After that he would walk to the Express building in Fleet Street at about four in the afternoon.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Under-watering and over-watering can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms that sometimes overlap with other peace lily ailments. However, since improper watering is also one of the easiest problems to fix, try attempting these remedies first before moving on to a more drastic solution. Under-watering should be fairly obvious: dry soil accompanied with wilting, yellowing leaves and a drooping stalk is a dead giveaway. Fix this by watering and misting more regularly - at least once a week for each. Note that plants that outgrow their containers will have a difficult time absorbing the water they need from a typical watering session. Over-watering can be slightly harder to diagnose, but is often characterized by brown leaf tips. Note that over-watering can lead to root rot, a separate, much more serious condition. Root rot is serious condition that can affect any potted plant with roots below the surface and can easily kill the plant. Generally, root rot is caused when a plant suffers from over-watering or poor drainage. If the roots are held in contact with standing water for a prolonged period of time, it becomes difficult for them to get the air that they need to function correctly, and as a result they will literally begin to rot. Certain types of microorganisms called water moulds contribute to the spreading rot, the spores of which can spread root rot to another plant if adequate moisture is present. Root rot is often fatal, but, to attempt to remedy it, immediately remove your lily from its pot and cut off any dead, slimy, or otherwise rotten portions of root. Pot the plant in a new pot with dry soil and proper drainage. Though root rot infects the plant below the surface, it will cause the plant to visibly begin to die above ground. If your lily seems to become increasingly wilted even with proper sun and frequent watering, root rot is likely the culprit. Peace lilies are sometimes susceptible to infection by aphids, mites, or other small arthropods. If you notice your lily's leaves begin to wilt or die, especially if accompanied by visible pests, a sticky, slimy discharge, or the presence of white webbing, it's likely that your plant has a pest infestation. Use a strong stream of water to blast the pests off of the plant, then, to make sure they don't return, use a plant-safe insecticide or this homemade recipe for insecticidal soap: Combine 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) vegetable oil, 3 Tbsp (16 g) cayenne pepper, and 1 Tbsp. (12 g) natural fat-derived soap (not liquid dish soap) in 1 quart (.95 liters) of warm water. Use a spray bottle to give your plant a thorough coating, but not before testing on a small part of the plant and leaving the soap in place for a day to ensure it doesn't cause any damage. Fungus infections can range from harmless to potentially fatal. If you see a white or grey fuzzy growth on the surface of the soil, you don't need to be terribly concerned, as this fungus is not a danger to the plant (though it can irritate some humans, especially those susceptible to allergies). To clear this minor fungal growth, you may want to try sprinkling cinnamon (which has anti-fungal properties) on the fungus. However, if the lily itself develops a dark or black coating on its stalk or leaves for no other apparent reason (frost damage, etc.), your plant likely has a serious fungal infection. Discarding the entire plant is always a viable option in this case, as fungal spores can be very persistent, remaining in the soil and surrounding area for a significant amount of time, where they can re-infect other plants. However, if you'd like to try to save the plant, carefully remove all the affected areas of the plant and discard them somewhere that they'll pose no danger. (like your garbage). Next, water the plant with compost tea, a natural fungicide, to attempt to kill spores that remain in the soil.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Exercise and other physical activities can greatly impact your body's hydration levels, and since kidneys play an essential role in fluid balance and the removal of waste, their performance can be influenced indirectly by these activities. If you're exercising a lot and not adequately replacing the fluids lost through sweat, you can become dehydrated. This makes the kidneys' job of filtering blood and balancing fluids more difficult, potentially leading to less efficient removal of waste. It should be noted, however, that this would be due to not properly managing hydration while exercising, rather than the act of exercising itself. Good hydration practices can help make sure the kidneys are working at their best, regardless of levels of physical activity. Furthermore, regular exercise is generally beneficial for overall health, including kidney health. Therefore, the potential impact on the kidney function and waste removal due to exercise is typically indirect, via fluid balance and hydration, rather than a direct alteration of the physiological processes involved in waste processing in the kidneys. It's an external factor affecting the conditions under which the kidney operates, not changing the steps of the process itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Paragraph: Jonathan is attending a football game for his favorite team. Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we can closely examine the details provided in the paragraph: 1. The fireworks create sound waves of high intensity. 2. The jets create sound waves of even higher intensity than the fireworks. Since the paragraph only provides a comparison between the intensity of the fireworks and jets, we cannot determine the exact decibel levels of each. However, we know that higher decibel levels are more likely to cause ear damage. Based on the information available, the fireworks sound was less intense than that of the jets flying over. Therefore, the fireworks sound is less likely to have caused damage to Jonathan's ears in comparison to the sound of the jets."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to... answer the following question: What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died?

Q:Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home.

In this case, the 14-year-old narrator was relocated from a facility for homeless children in Manhattan to a foster home in an unknown location, possibly in Eastern Queens or the Bronx. The sudden change in environment, the unknowns about the new home, and the lack of clear communication contribute to the anxiety and disorientation that the narrator is experiencing. As for the question about who showed the narrator his room, the answer is C. his foster parents. According to the narrative, after arriving at the new home, the foster parents showed the narrator his room and left a plate of food on the table for him. Following this, they went into their bedroom, which was likened to pilots barricading themselves behind a fortified cockpit door. The living situation itself had elements that contributed to the unsettled feeling the narrator experienced. The lack of locks on bedroom and bathroom doors, bars on the windows, and the presence of other unfamiliar youth in the house added to the sense of chaos and lack of control. Additionally, the narrator had very little information about his new environment, including how to get to his high school and the names of his new foster siblings. This story highlights the importance of ensuring that children in foster care have access to adequate support, clear communication, and resources to help them transition into their new environments. Such an effort can alleviate some of the fear and disorientation that can come with a major life change. It is essential for foster parents and support workers to prioritize creating a welcoming and safe environment, and to provide the necessary information that will help ease the transition for youth placed in their care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

Answer this question: what genre of music does cardi b sing??","completion":"Cardi B, born as Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is a multi-talented American rapper, songwriter, and television personality known for her vibrant personality and distinctive musical style. Though her music draws from various genres, it primarily falls within the realm of hip hop and rap. One of the key reasons behind Cardi B's success in the music industry is her unique style, which effectively merges different musical elements. Here's an in-depth look at the aspects that characterize her musical orientations: 1. Hip Hop and Rap: Cardi B's music is heavily influenced by hip hop and rap, which originated in African American and Latinx communities during the 1970s. These genres involve rhythmically spoken lyrics, also known as rapping, over beats often created from existing recordings. Cardi B's breakout hit \\"Bodak Yellow\\" displayed her lyrical prowess, and her debut album \\"Invasion of Privacy\\" cemented her position among the top rap artists. 2. Trap: Cardi B incorporates elements of trap music into her songs. Trap is a subgenre of hip hop, characterized by dark, aggressive beats, ominous atmospheres, and lyrics that centre around themes of drugs, violence, and life in the \\"trap\\" (referring to impoverished urban areas). Notable singles, such as \\"Bartier Cardi\\" and \\"Money,\\" retain this trap influence. 3. Reggaeton and Latin Trap: As an artist of Dominican-Trinidadian descent, Cardi B also embraces her Latin roots in some of her songs. She has collaborated with popular Latin artists like Bad Bunny and J Balvin on the track \\"I Like It,\\" which samples a traditional Latin boogaloo song while incorporating modern reggaeton and Latin trap elements. Her collaboration with Ozuna on \\"La Modelo\\" and her feature in Anitta's \\"Me Gusta\\" are further examples of Cardi B's versatility and engagement with Latin music. 4. R&B and Pop: While primarily a hip hop and rap artist, Cardi B also dabbles in R&B and pop, making her music accessible to a wider audience. Her collaborations with artists from different musical backgrounds, such as pop icons Bruno Mars (\\"Finesse\\" and \\"Please Me\\") and Maroon 5 (\\"Girls Like You\\"), are testaments to her ability to cross and blend genres. In summary, while Cardi B is rooted in hip hop and rap, she fuses various genres like trap, reggaeton, Latin trap, R&B, and pop to create a distinctive sound. Her unique approach to music has brought her both commercial success and critical acclaim, solidifying her position as a force to be reckoned within the modern music scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Yes, the answer addresses the question about the location of a bird's cochlea, but it could be more detailed and informative. Allow me to provide an expanded response. A bird's cochlea is situated within the inner ear, just as it is in mammals and other vertebrates. The primary function of the cochlea is to convert sound vibrations into electrical signals which are then transmitted to the brain for processing and interpretation. While mammalian cochleae typically have a spiral shape, the avian cochlea has a different structure, being straight and shorter compared to its mammalian counterpart. This difference in shape contributes to the variation in hearing capabilities between birds and mammals. The avian inner ear can be divided into three main parts: the semicircular canals, the vestibule, and the cochlea. The semicircular canals are responsible for detecting changes in head position and maintaining balance, while the vestibule, specifically the utricle and saccule, also play a role in maintaining balance as well as sensing linear acceleration. The bird's cochlea, also known as the lagena or basilar papilla, is situated near the junction of the semicircular canals and the vestibule. The cochlea has a straight and tubular structure that contains a fluid-filled cavity and sensory hair cells. These specialized hair cells detect sound vibrations and convert them into electrical signals to be sent to the brain for interpretation. The auditory nerve, which connects the inner ear to the brain, is responsible for transmitting these electrical signals. Birds possess fewer hair cells in their cochlea compared to mammals, which is one of the reasons for their generally narrower hearing range. In summary, a bird's cochlea is located in the inner ear, adjacent to the semicircular canals and the vestibule. Although its structure is different from its mammalian counterpart, it serves the same purpose of detecting sound vibrations and converting them into electrical signals for the brain to process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances.

Considering them individually: - herpes: This could happen when kissing anyone, anywhere if one person has the herpes virus.

Justifying all these points, the option that makes the most sense when kissing outside, by process of elimination through relevance, is 'get cold'.

Moreover, not only does it sound implausible, but it is also not a common upgrade for people looking for a temporary stay. 3. hall - A hall typically refers to a large room or building for gatherings. It is not suitable as an upgrade from a small cabin because it doesn't generally represent a living accommodation or an improvement in that aspect. 4. palace - Although a palace could be considered an upgrade from a small cabin, due to its large and luxurious nature, it might be excessive and unrealistic as an available option for an upgrade. 5. hotel - Hotels are well-known for offering accommodations and can offer different levels of services and room sizes, making them a possible upgrade from a small cabin. After carefully analyzing each option, the most plausible and contextually fitting answer is 'villa'. It provides a reasonable upgrade from a small cabin, as both are private accommodations, but a villa suggests more luxurious and spacious living conditions.

No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment. That’s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body. Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see Figure below ). Evaporation of water from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth and throat uses heat and helps cool the body. Q: How do dogs lose body heat?

Background: Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. Context: At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds). His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21. In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976). Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Question: Where was the 1964 Summer Olympics at?

She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn? Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

The city has two shipping terminals, owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority, which are part of the fourth-largest container seaport on the East Coast and the thirteenth-largest container seaport in North America. Charleston is becoming a popular location for information technology jobs and corporations, and this sector has had the highest rate of growth between 2011 and 2012, due in large part to the Charleston Digital Corridor.

They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species. - Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753.

A neatly dressed tourist taking pictures in Times Square was caught off guard when a visibly agitated woman blocked her path and then attacked her. The 34-year-old long-haired blonde woman was walking with a friend and photographing their surroundings with a point-and-shoot camera when the aggravated passer-by confronted her and stood in her way. The confrontation at West 46th Street and Broadway, across the street from a Forever 21, led to a verbal exchange which quickly turned into a scuffle. Attacked: The blonde tourist was knocked down and hit her head which was bleeding profusely. Head wound: The woman hit her head on the ground leaving an open gash. Bad day: The woman looked visibly upset as a police officer came over to help. The alleged aggressor, Deanne Ostbye, 30, was wearing ripped sweat pants and a hooded sweatshirt with the names of New York neighborhoods printed on the front. Ostbye, from Tacoma, Wash., allegedly knocked the blonde woman knocked down to the ground. The victim's personal belongings were scattered along the sidewalk. The assaulted tourist was seen on the sidewalk with a bleeding gash on her head when a nearby police officer came over to break up the fight. The victim looked frightened and shocked, Alberto Reyes, a photographer who captured the incident told MailOnline. She was taken to Roosevelt hospital where she was treated for her head injury. Local aggressor: The attacker was smiling as a photographer snapped her picture. 'Freedom of speech': The attacker was reportedly yelling out 'freedom of speech' as a police officer told her to stay still. Search: The police officer searched the attacker, who was wearing ripped sweat pants and a hooded sweatshirt. Accused: Police were not immediately able to say why Ostbye allegedly assaulted the woman. Ostbye was yelling out ‘freedom of speech’ as the police officer told her to stay still, Reyes said. She was moving around ‘very anxiously,’ he said. The attacker was smiling as Reyes took her photograph. Disoriented: The assaulted woman's personal belongings were scattered along the sidewalk.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To increase anti-depression hormones naturally, we will focus on activities and lifestyle changes that boost serotonin and endorphin levels. These neurotransmitters are responsible for regulating mood and promoting a sense of well-being. I will outline a few methods, along with justifications for each step, to help achieve this goal: 1. Exercise regularly - Regular physical activity increases endorphin production, which helps improve mood and lower stress. - Include a mix of aerobic activity (e.g., running, biking) and strength training for optimal results. 2. Eat a balanced diet - Diet plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy serotonin levels. - Include foods rich in tryptophan – an amino acid that is the precursor to serotonin – such as eggs, dairy, lean meat, nuts, and seeds. - Consume complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables as they encourage the release of insulin, which helps tryptophan enter the brain. - Eat regularly and avoid extreme diets or long periods of hunger to maintain stable blood sugar levels and reduce mood swings. 3. Get adequate sleep - Sleep is essential for the overall well-being, and a lack of sleep can negatively impact mood and emotional health. - Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep per night to allow the body and mind to rest and regenerate, helping maintain hormonal balance. 4. Manage stress - Chronic stress has been linked to decreased serotonin levels. - Engage in stress-reduction activities such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation to help regulate mood and increase serotonin production. 5. Surround yourself with a positive social circle - Interacting with loved ones and supportive people increases feelings of happiness, belonging, and self-worth, all of which can boost serotonin levels. - Participate in group activities, maintain strong friendships, and seek out support when needed. 6. Spend time in nature - Exposure to sunlight can increase serotonin production and help regulate circadian rhythms, which are essential for a balanced mood. - Aim to spend at least 30 minutes outdoors daily, weather permitting. 7. Practice gratitude - Fostering a sense of gratitude and focusing on positive aspects of life has been linked to improved mood and overall well-being. - Write down three things you're grateful for each day, or take a few moments to reflect on them. In summary, incorporating exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, stress management, social connections, time spent outdoors, and gratitude practice into your daily life can help increase anti-depression hormones naturally. It is important to find a combination of these strategies that works best for you and maintain consistency in practicing them for long-term benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Went here after the Pacquiao Marquez Fight on a Saturday night back in March. Friend's hot friend Amber who bartends there hooked it up, even though the guy working the guest list hustled us all for 20 each, since he saw that we just rolled 6 guys deep with no females, even though Amber told us her guest list was free, but oh well, we didn't even have to wait in line and they let us straight up the escalator into the club, so it was all good. I like the decor and ambiance at this club. They pay hot women to just chill at the entrance and look sexy. Drink prices are Vegas standard over here too. Kind of a journey at first to find the bathroom, but it's there. I really liked this place cause it wasn't too over crowded and it wasn't too empty. Plus there's always little Asian kids walking around looking to see if you're in need of some drugs. That's always a plus for a good night out in Vegas, cause whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas unless you end up with a STD from a casual 1 night stand. The DJs played a pretty good mix of music the night we went too, mostly hip-hop and some mash-ups. Not sure what they were doing playing Darude's Sandstorm that night, but that kind of brought back memories of High School Dances. And if you get kicked out, the bouncers mark giant X's on the back of your hands with a black sharpie so you can't re-enter the club, so have fun scrubbing with that soap in the bathroom if you get booted out and all your friends are still in the club. And if you get caught making out behind a curtain, chances are you probably might get kicked out like one of my friends did. Haha!","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed or neutral with a slightly positive leaning. Step 1: Identify positive aspects - The user mentioned liking the decor and ambiance, not having to wait in line, a good mix of music, and a balanced crowd.

Step 2: Identify negative aspects - The user experienced hustling at the guest list, overpriced drinks, difficulty locating the bathroom, and one of their friends getting kicked out. Step 3: Consider the user's overall experience - While there were a few setbacks (guest list hustling, drink prices), the user still had an overall enjoyable experience, with a good ambiance, music, and crowd. Step 4: Determine sentiment - Taking into account the positive aspects mentioned and the overall experience, the sentiment leans towards slightly positive, but still retains a neutral aspect due to the negative aspects.

The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again.

Information: - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the \\"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"CJCS\\"), \\"Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"VCJCS\\"), and the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside of their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - William Joseph ( \`\` Wild Bill '' ) Donovan ( January 1 , 1883 -- February 8 , 1959 ) was a United States soldier , lawyer , intelligence officer and diplomat . Donovan is best remembered as the wartime head of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency , during World War II. He is also known as the \`\` Father of American Intelligence '' and the \`\` Father of Central Intelligence '' . A decorated veteran of World War I , General Donovan is the only person to have received all four of the United States ' highest awards : The Medal of Honor , the Distinguished Service Cross , the Distinguished Service Medal , and the National Security Medal . He is also a recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart , as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars . - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of instrument did McBurney point out was a haunting sound that punctuated the Kije music? ? Despite his lack of experience in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: \\"I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film\\". He told the producers, \\"What is important to me is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero\\", and warned them not to expect mere musical \\"illustrations\\". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score is one of several works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show \\"the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century\\". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the \\"haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone\\" that punctuate the Kijé music.The critic Ernest Chapman refers to Prokofiev's \\"unfailingly witty and melodious score\\". It comprises only about 15 minutes of music, written as a series of 16 short fragments or leitmotifs which are repeated at appropriate times during the film's duration, to highlight specific moments in the drama. This approach was a departure in film music from the established form of broad symphonic movements, and was described by Prokofiev's biographer Daniel Jaffé as \\"well ahead of its time ... one of the most celebrated [film scores] of that era\\".

Given the question: Process: - Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher - Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack - Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack - Place all the utensils in the utensil basket - Put detergent into the detergent holder - Close the door and push the start button - suppose a person is dieting happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"not impacting any step of the process. The process of loading and operating a dishwasher is a sequence of physical actions and interactions with the machine. The person's dieting status plays no direct role in how those tasks are performed, since dieting is related to personal food intake and does not influence the mechanics or procedures of operating the dishwasher. A person may indirectly influence the dishwasher's efficiency if their diet leads them to use certain types of dishes or produce certain types of food waste. For example, someone on a protein-heavy diet may generate more grease, which could potentially cause issues with the dishwasher's cleaning ability. However, the task given does not specify this, so it's fair to say that dieting does not inherently or directly influence any of the steps of the dishwashing process. In summary, the hypothetical perturbation of a person dieting does not directly impact the given process of loading and running a dishwasher. Therefore, the perturbation is that it does not impact any step of the process, unless some indirect and unspecified aspect of the diet is affecting dish cleanliness. This assumes that the person's diet does not significantly change the types or amounts of dishes being washed, the types or amounts of food residue, or any other factors that could potentially affect the dishwasher's performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Works from whose later years included the cello Sonata Duo? ? Temperley writes: \\"After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.\\" Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

At the workplace, Miguel likes a bagel in the morning, but not toast. The","completion":"sunrise cast a warm glow over the city as Miguel made his way to the office. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of baked goods from the small cafe down the street. His stomach growled quietly, a reminder that it was time for his favorite breakfast ritual: a delicious, perfectly toasted bagel. Miguel never understood his colleagues' obsession with toast. To him, it was nothing more than a dry, bland canvas for the toppings of the world. On the other hand, bagels offered a more complex flavor and that amazing chewiness that Miguel simply couldn't resist. In his mind, there was nothing better than sinking his teeth into a warm, soft bagel slathered with cream cheese to start the day. Raymond, one of Miguel's coworkers, joined him one day in the break room as he toasted his bagel to just the right golden brown hue. Raymond raised an eyebrow and asked him, \\"Why not toast, Miguel? Don't you get bored of bagels every single day?\\" Miguel smiled as he spread a generous amount of cream cheese over his bagel. \\"It's not about the bagel itself, Raymond. It's the ritual, the comfort, and the way it sets the tone for my day. Besides, there are so many different flavors and combinations to choose from,\\" he explained. Raymond nodded, intrigued by Miguel's perspective. \\"Well, you do have a point. I can see how the routine can be soothing.\\" As they continued their conversation, Miguel couldn't help but reflect on the deeper meaning behind his bagel preference. Sure, it was just a breakfast food, but it carried a sense of familiarity and consistency that he often craved in his hectic life. The morning bagel ritual provided him with an anchor, a moment of solace in the eye of the storm that was his daily routine. Over the following weeks, Miguel started to notice that some of his colleagues had begun to discover the magic of bagels. In the break room, they shared their favorite flavor combinations and toppings, exchanging excited banter as they toasted their breakfast treats. It was fascinating to Miguel how something as simple as a bagel could create a sense of connection and camaraderie among his coworkers. One particular morning, when a fresh batch of bagels arrived in the office, Jasmine, the office manager, provided a surprise spread of different cream cheese flavors and jams for everyone to try. The break room buzzed with chatter as everyone slathered their chosen concoctions onto their preferred bagels, some laughing in delight at their newfound love for the versatile ring-shaped bread. As Miguel stood in the corner observing the lively scene, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. His love for bagels had turned into a small movement within the office, creating memorable moments amongst his coworkers in the process. He realized that what was once merely a personal breakfast choice had now transformed into a shared experience, weaving its way into the fabric of their daily lives. As the weeks went on, Miguel continued to enjoy his bagel-laden mornings with his colleagues. Each bite reminded him of the importance of finding joy in the smallest of details, whether it be a warm, toasted bagel or a heartwarming conversation with a friend. And although toast still made its appearance in the break room, Miguel believed he had shown his coworkers the blissful taste of bagelhood, turning even the most ardent toast lovers into bagel enthusiasts.

Information: - The Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, and including the \\"Four-Power Treaty\\" and the \\"Nine-power Treaty\\" was a treaty among the major nations that had won World War I, which agreed to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference, held in Washington, D.C., from November 1921 to February 1922, and it was signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were not limited by the treaty, but those ships were limited to 10,000 tons displacement. - Justice was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Liberté class built by the French Navy . She had three sister ships : Liberté , Vérité , and Démocratie . Justice was laid down in April 1903 , launched in October 1904 , and completed in February 1908 , over a year after the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought made ships like Justice obsolete . She was armed with a main battery of four 305 mm ( 12.0 in ) guns , compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on Dreadnought . After her commissioning , Justice was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet . In September 1909 , she traveled to the United States for the Hudson - Fulton Celebration . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first days of the war , and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without seeing any action . After the war ended , she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War , though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet 's withdrawal . Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922 . - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however. - The San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site includes the location of the Battle of San Jacinto, and the USS \\"Texas\\". It is located off the Houston Ship Channel in unincorporated Harris County, Texas near the city of Houston. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.
