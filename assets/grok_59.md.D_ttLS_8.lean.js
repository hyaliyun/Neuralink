Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you determine — through a macronutrient calculator — that you currently eat more than 30 grams of carbs daily, look for ways to decrease your carb intake. It’s crucial to avoid carbs on a ketogenic diet, as carbs easily convert into glucose, which keeps your body from burning ketones for energy. You should only receive about 5–10% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, by eating about 20 – 30 grams a day. Focus on getting your carbs through salad greens and non-starchy vegetables only. Avoid carb-heavy foods like pasta and bread. Protein is a necessary part of your diet, and without proteins, you will have very little energy. You may also feel hungrier or develop food cravings throughout the day. However, too much protein will diminish the weight-loss effects of a ketogenic diet. You should aim to consume about 25 – 30% of your daily calories from proteins. The amount of protein you eat will vary depending on how much protein you require as an individual. This is often tied to lifestyle, whether active or sedentary. Fats are the cornerstone of the ketogenic diet, and will encourage your body to burn fatty ketones for fuel. Typically, calories from fat should comprise 80 – 90% of your meals. (However, you cannot eat unlimited fats on a ketogenic diet; the calories can still add up and cause weight gain.) Examples of fatty foods include: Organic butter and lard Coconut oil Fatty cuts of organic, grass-fed meat. Egg yolks and full-fat sour cream Homemade mayonnaise Heavy whipping cream and cream cheese Avocados and bacon Nuts and nut butters Unlike many other weight-loss diets, you do not need to actively keep track of the number of calories in the dishes you eat while on a ketogenic diet. Since a ketogenic diet reduces food cravings throughout the day, you’ll likely be less motivated to eat excess calories anyway. If you do want to track your calories, use the following breakdown as a guide (assuming that you’ll consume about 1,500 calories a day): 1,050 calories from fat 300 calories from protein 150 calories from carbohydrates Once your body is in ketosis, your kidneys will begin to release excess water which your body had been retaining. This retained water is a consequence of a high-carb diet, and once you reduce your carb intake, water retention will decrease as well. As a consequence, you may need to increase your daily water intake to avoid dehydration. Headaches and muscle cramps are a sign of dehydration. You may also need to increase mineral intake, especially salt and magnesium, as these are often lost when your body gets rid of retained water. Summary:","completion":"This article is about a special diet called the ketogenic diet. To follow this diet, you need to eat very few carbs (like bread and pasta), some protein (like meat), and lots of healthy fats (like avocado and nuts). It's important to not eat too many carbs because they turn into sugar in your body, which stops it from burning fat for energy. Eating the right amount of protein is also important because it gives you energy and helps you feel full. When you follow this diet, your body burns fat for energy and you might lose weight. You don't need to count calories, but you may need to drink more water and eat more salt and magnesium, because your body will lose some when you stop eating many carbs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of clouds blocking sunlight while acid rain is causing damage can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To better understand this, let's analyze the process and how the clouds can affect it: 1. Acid rain makes waters acidic: Clouds blocking sunlight doesn't have a direct impact on the formation of acid rain, as acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from burning fossil fuels that combine with water molecules in the atmosphere. 2. Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil: When waters become acidic, they are more capable of leaching aluminum from the soil. While sunlight isn't directly involved in this chemical process, prolonged periods of cloud cover can indirectly affect soil temperature and moisture levels, potentially influencing the absorption process. 3. The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc: Clouds blocking sunlight may indirectly influence the rate of water evaporation and, thus, alter the amount of water runoff entering aquatic systems. However, the acidification of water due to the presence of acid rain remains unaffected. 4. Fish and their eggs die: Clouds blocking sunlight can have an indirect effect on fish and their eggs by affecting the temperature of the water and altering the oxygen levels in it. Cooler water temperatures can cause fish to become less active and more susceptible to the harmful effects of acid rain. 5. Frogs and plants die: Sunlight plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, which is essential for plant growth. Blocking sunlight can weaken plants, making them more vulnerable to damage caused by acid rain. Similarly, frogs and other amphibians that rely on aquatic environments and plants for habitat may face additional stress due to the reduced availability of food and shelter, making them more susceptible to the harmful effects of acid rain. 6. Insects and other wildlife die: The indirect effect of sunlight blocking on the rest of the ecosystem is a cascading consequence of the stress and damage experienced by fish, frogs, and plants. This can further weaken the food chain, making insects and other wildlife more susceptible to the effects of acid rain. 7. The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems: With the ecosystem already in distress due to acid rain, the additional stress of sunlight blocking can compound these effects and further throw the ecosystem out of balance. In conclusion, clouds blocking sunlight can worsen the damage caused by acid rain by indirectly impacting various steps in the process. While sunlight does not have a direct role in the chemical process of acid rain formation and its immediate consequences, the blocked sunlight affects the overall health and resilience of the ecosystem being harmed by acid rain, making it more vulnerable to damage and imbalance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The comical-sounding phrase made its first appearance back in October, when 17-year-old Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug - who calls herself Ruby - said she had attended \\"bunga bunga\\" parties with other women at Mr Berlusconi's villa in Milan. Italian newspapers immediately scrambled to find out its origins. The finger of blame was initially laid upon Mr Berlusconi's friend Col Muammar Gaddafi, with allegations of parties hosted by the Libyan leader involving \\"harems\\" of young Western women. Then stories circulated claiming the phrase owed its origins to a bawdy joke, which Mr Berlusconi claimed was one of his favourites. Then this week Sabina Began, German actress and friend of the Italian prime minister, told Sky Italia that she herself was bunga bunga. \\"'Bunga bunga' is simply my nickname,\\" the 36-year-old said. It's a credible-sounding explanation: \\"Began\\" and \\"Bunga\\" are not so different, and the repetition gives it a more informal, nickname-like quality. \\"Everyone thinks: 'My God! What does that mean?\\" she is quoted as saying. Ms Began went on to explain that it was she who had organised the parties for Mr Berlusconi. The phrase \\"bunga bunga\\", is having a global impact, says Paul JJ Payack, president of The Global Language Monitor in the US. \\"One of our databases that searches the top global media found almost 800 stories spread across the world. \\"Since Mr Berlusconi was reported as saying that he learned harem-style rituals frοm hіѕ friend, Col Gaddafi, the phrase has been reported in Arabic-language news stories. \\"On our Chinese search engines there were over 2000 references to news stories in Chinese. \\"Finally, we found thousands of references in Russian. \\"Will it make the English language lexicon? It certainly seems headed that way. It needs a minimum of 25,000 references with the necessary depth and breadth. It currently has 744,000 references on Google.\\" Global Language Monitor The expression has quickly become part of the Italian vocabulary, says Italian journalist Annalisa Piras, even though no-one really knows what it means. The theory that it features in Mr Berlusconi's favourite joke is a popular one, she says. The joke isn't new - it can be found on the internet Urban Dictionary - but in Italy it has been given a political twist. It goes like this: Two of Mr Berlusconi's political opponents are captured by an African tribe. They are asked whether they would prefer to die or undergo bunga bunga. The first one opts for bunga bunga, and is immediately subjected to a sexual assault by members of the tribe. The second one, who now grasps what \\"bunga bunga\\" means, says he would prefer to die. To which the chief of the tribe replies: \\"Okay, you will die - but before you will have bunga bunga.\\" Ms Piras says the term is now well embedded in the Italian language. \\"Bunga Bunga City\\" refers to Mr Berlusconi's world, the phrase is a popular twitter hashtag, and it even inspired a song performed on Italian television to the tune of Shakira's Waka Waka World Cup anthem. In Italy, \\"bunga bunga\\" is pronounced: BOONG-guh BOONG-guh (-oo as in moon, -ng-g as in finger, -uh as a in ago, stressed syllables in upper case). Source: BBC Pronunciation unit The phrase itself is not new. One of the oldest recorded references dates back to 1910 and another African-themed joke. The infamous Dreadnought hoax was dreamed up by aristocratic joker Horace de Vere Cole, who contacted the British Admiralty pretending to be the Emperor of Abyssinia. He informed officials that he wished to inspect the Home Fleet while on a forthcoming visit to Britain. After enlisting some friends - artists from the Bloomsbury group, including writer Virginia Woolf - to masquerade as his entourage, he turned up at the navy's state-of-the-art ship, the Dreadnought. Officials, taken in by the dark stage make-up, false beards and oriental regalia, treated the group to an official civic reception. They were reported to have cried \\"Bunga, bunga!\\" while marvelling at the ship. An account of the visit plus a picture were sent to the Daily Mail newspaper - probably by Cole himself. Virginia Woolf said later that when the real Emperor of Abyssinia arrived in London weeks later, wherever he went, ''the street boys ran after him calling out bunga, bunga!\\" When I went on board a Dreadnought ship I looked like a costermonger; They said I was an Abyssinian prince 'Cos I shouted 'Bunga Bunga!' Source: The Sultan of Zanzibar: The Bizarre World and Spectacular Hoaxes of Horace de Vere Cole, Martyn Downer The term reappeared at the end of World War I, after HMS Dreadnought sank a German submarine. According to retired Royal Navy captain Jack Broome - in his book Make Another Signal - the congratulatory telegram read: \\"BUNGA BUNGA\\". The Dreadnought hoax is certainly not the inspiration for the current use of the phrase - but Mr Berlusconi may intend the phrase to have African connotations, says Tony Thorne, editor of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang. \\"The sound of it is crude and infantile. It is almost like a racist Africanism - some kind of colonial imagined tribal ritual of sexual abandon,\\" he says. \\"It has a racist, imperialist quality to it - like a phoney African word, like 'wonga'. \\"It's so naughty and childish, it goes very nicely with the image that I think Mr Berlusconi wants to cultivate, as comic and absurd.\\" Ms Piras says that usage of the phrase in Italy has brought to a new level Mr Berlusconi's image as \\"jester-in-chief\\". \\"He has managed to capture in a slogan the imagination of many of his male compatriots, and the utter contempt of almost every Italian woman.\\" The phrase \\"bunga bunga\\" exists in other languages - in Filipino, it is slang for something \\"hot\\" or fashionable, in Indonesian it means flowers. But, for now, it has an association with the Italian prime minister and the current political scandal - or \\"bunga bunga-gate\\", if you will.

Please answer this question: Which city is in the Chao Phraya River delta?","completion":"The city located in the Chao Phraya River delta is Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. Bangkok, officially known as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon in Thai, is a vibrant urban metropolis and the most populous city in the country, with a population of over 10 million people. The Chao Phraya River is a significant geographical feature of the city, providing essential water resources and transportation routes for both local residents and tourists. The Chao Phraya River, which means \\"The River of Kings\\" in Thai, originates in the north of Thailand, where the Ping and Nan rivers converge, and flows through the central plain for approximately 372 kilometers (231 miles) before emptying into the Gulf of Thailand. The river delta is an extensive area of tidal mudflats, mangroves, and agricultural land, which supports diverse ecosystems and is crucial for rice production in the region. As the main river running through Bangkok, the Chao Phraya River plays a vital role in the city's history, culture, and economy. Bangkok was established as the capital city of Thailand by King Rama I in 1782 and was deliberately positioned near the Chao Phraya River to take advantage of its strategic location for transportation, commerce, and defense. Over time, the city expanded across both banks of the river, utilizing its natural resources to support the growing population and economy. Today, the Chao Phraya River continues to be an essential part of Bangkok's daily life and serves as a major transportation artery for both people and goods. Traditional water taxis and ferries, as well as modern river boats and express boats, ply the river, providing convenient public transportation for commuters, tourists, and local residents alike. The river also facilitates the transportation of cargo, contributing significantly to Bangkok's economic activities. Apart from its practical importance, the Chao Phraya River is home to numerous culturally and historically significant sites, such as the iconic Grand Palace and Wat Pho (the Temple of the Reclining Buddha), both of which are located on the eastern bank of the river. Additionally, the riverside is lined with various luxury hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues, offering picturesque views of the city and the river. In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the ecological preservation and sustainable development of the Chao Phraya River delta. Through various conservation efforts and policies aimed at controlling pollution and preserving natural habitats, Bangkok and the Thai government are working towards ensuring a sustainable future for the river, its delta, and the millions of residents and visitors who depend on its myriad benefits."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

James preferred sitting down in his room with his cat rather than taking a walk in the neighborhood. The [I] room is peaceful. [II] neighborhood is peaceful.","completion":"James preferred sitting down in his room with his cat rather than taking a walk in the neighborhood. He enjoyed the tranquility and familiar comfort that his personal space provided to him after a long day at work. Being an introvert, he found solace in the company of his cat, Mr. Whiskers, who had been his furry companion for the past five years. The room, filled with soft music, scented candles, and an array of James' favorite books, was his haven away from the stresses of the outside world. [I] One could say that James' room is a peaceful sanctuary where he can recharge his batteries and reflect on the day's events without any distractions. The soft, calming colors of the walls, combined with the dim, warm lighting, create an atmosphere that instantly puts him at ease. Even the presence of his sleeping cat, purring gently on a cozy blanket beside him adds to the serenity that surrounds him. His room is not only organized but also adorned with little trinkets from his travels - a small wooden carving from Bali, a miniature Eiffel Tower from Paris, and a vibrant painting he bought at a local market in Mexico. Each item brings back memories of joyful moments that bring a warm smile to his face. This peaceful refuge allows James to focus on his hobbies, such as painting and reading, without feeling the pressure of external expectations. [II] On the other hand, while the neighborhood itself is peaceful, with tree-lined streets, well-maintained gardens, and neighbors who conscientiously maintain a considerate noise level, it doesn't provide the same level of comfort and familiarity as his room does. While taking a walk in the neighborhood can be refreshing for some people, James finds it mentally draining. During these walks, James feels obligated to have small talks with neighbors or encounters things that remind him of the everyday mundaneness that he wants to escape. The neighborhood, despite its quiet and friendly nature, often entails unpredictable encounters and a lack of control over the environment. For instance, the occasional barking of a neighbor's dog could break the silence without warning, or the sudden chatter from a group of joggers passing by could dispel the peace he is seeking. These external factors make it challenging for James to find the same solace that his room offers. In summary, while both James' room and the neighborhood may be peaceful in their ways, the comfort and personalization of his room allows James to feel secure and at ease more than the neighborhood does. His room, with its serene ambiance, cherished possessions, and a loyal companion in Mr. Whiskers, is a reflection of his personality and a place for him to recharge his energy. Meanwhile, the neighborhood, though peaceful and visually appealing, lacks these comforting factors and, thus, isn't as effective in offering James the relaxation he desires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Spanish, instead of using \\"wake\\", \\"paso\\" is used to convey the same meaning. \\"A much smaller shadow\\" is \\"una sombra mucho más pequeña\\". \\"Una\\" is the indefinite article that corresponds with \\"a\\", \\"sombra\\" translates to \\"shadow\\", \\"mucho más\\" means \\"much more\\" and \\"pequeña\\" means \\"smaller\\". \\"Descended much faster.\\" is translated as \\"descendió mucho más rápido.\\" Here, \\"descendió\\" is the past tense of the Spanish verb \\"descender\\" (to descend), conveying the same past action as in the English sentence. \\"Mucho más\\" is used again for \\"much more\\", and \\"rápido\\" is the Spanish word for \\"faster\\". “Sarasa-sama!” remains same in the translation as it appears to be a name or title. \\"Tobashi shouted.\\" is \\"Gritó Tobashi\\". In Spanish, the verb often precedes the noun, especially in sentences like this. \\"Gritó\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"gritar\\" (to shout), and \\"Tobashi\\" remains same as it is a name."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: obama admits he erred in deal with developer Text:","completion":"Title: Obama Admits Mistake in Deal with Developer Former President Barack Obama recently admitted that he made an error in his past dealings with a real estate developer. The admission comes as further details surrounding the controversial transaction become more publicly known, raising questions about the legitimacy of the deal. During his early political career, Obama entered into an agreement with a notorious Chicago developer, whose background in some questionable business practices had already garnered a negative reputation. Despite this, Obama chose to proceed with the deal, convinced by the potential benefits it could bring to his local community. As the details of the arrangement unfolded, it became apparent that the developer's intentions were not entirely aligned with Obama's vision of revitalizing the community. The developer took advantage of the agreement, engaging in unethical activities and ultimately, delivering far less than what was initially promised. Reflecting on this issue, Obama expressed his regret at not having been vigilant enough with the actions of the developer. He acknowledged that he was naive at the time and that, in hindsight, his decision to enter into the deal with the disreputable developer was an error in judgment. Moreover, President Obama emphasized that he took valuable lessons from this experience. He stated that the situation acted as a wake-up call, highlighting the importance of conducting thorough background checks and exercising careful scrutiny when entering into agreements with private entities. The former president's admission of his error in this real estate deal serves as a testament to his character and willingness to take accountability for his actions. Despite the negative publicity surrounding the developer and the deal in question, Obama's candid self-assessment reveals his commitment to maintaining a culture of openness and honesty. Moving forward, Barack Obama's experiences serve as a cautionary tale, not only for politicians but also for anyone involved in contractual agreements or collaborations with private entities. The need for diligence, thorough research and critical evaluation of potential partners cannot be overstated, as these factors can be crucial in preventing future mishaps and preserving one's reputation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer:","completion":"William Webster was an English Australian politician who was born on 7 June 1860 in Everton, Lancashire, England. He later moved to Australia and was active in politics, playing a significant role in the early years of the Australian Parliament. As a politician, William Webster was a member of two political parties during his career. Initially, he joined the Labor party (1901-1917) and later switched to the Nationalist party (1917-1919). He represented the constituency of Gwydir in the Australian Parliament. Webster's career in the parliament began on 16 December 1903 when he succeeded George Cruickshank. His term as a constituency MP lasted until 13 December 1919 when he was succeeded by Lou Cunningham. Apart from his political involvement, William Webster was also known for being a Unionist, supporting the rights of workers and trade unions. His dedication to the cause likely influenced his political stances and decision-making during his time in office. In his personal life, William Webster was married to Jane Buckney. The couple likely settled in Australia and formed a life together there. Webster eventually passed away at the age of 76 on 3 October 1936. His death took place in Parramatta, Sydney, leaving behind a legacy as a committed politician and advocate for workers' rights. Overall, William Webster's life can be described as one of service and dedication to both his country and the people he represented.

There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". The answer is:","completion":"Grohl"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of \\"studio schools\\" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \\"line manager\\". The reforms are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught \\"through projects, often prepared with employers\\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications connected directly to the needs of local employers. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements about the new \\"studio schools\\" in the UK is accurate? A. Teenagers can move to the studio schools only at the age of 16, focusing on traditional academic subjects. B.

Students will not be required to participate in work placements as part of their curriculum. D.

They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans.

Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture.

After months of anticipation and anxiety, the day had finally arrived for Neil to undergo a groundbreaking medical procedure designed to rectify the damage caused by a severe spinal cord injury. His good friend and highly-specialized surgeon, Dr. Nick Holden, had been chosen to perform the critical operation. Dr. Nick Holden was known as one of the best in his field, and he had spent countless hours developing a revolutionary new technique that he believed had immense potential to change the lives of countless patients. Driven by his desire to make a difference in people's lives, his many years of research and practice had culminated in this moment, where he would have the chance to test his method on his dear friend Neil. The atmosphere in the operating room was electric, as the team of skilled medical professionals assembled to support Dr. Nick in this groundbreaking procedure. The air was filled with a mix of excitement and hope. Neil had been preparing himself mentally for months, and he knew that if anyone could succeed in helping him regain his mobility, it was his good friend Dr. Nick. Upon entering the operating room, Neil could sense the collective breath of determination from the medical team. As the nurses and surgical assistants prepped Neil for the surgery, Dr. Nick's calm demeanor seemed to reverberate throughout the room, assuaging any lingering fears that may have been present. It was clear that he had prepared diligently, not only for the surgery itself but also for the unique challenge of operating on a close friend. The intricate procedure started, with Dr. Nick meticulously leading the team as they navigated the delicate surgery. Hour by hour, they implanted the sophisticated nanotechnology into Neil's spinal cord, all the while carefully repairing any collateral damage from the procedure. The tension in the room subsided as the minutes ticked by and Dr. Nick's confident hands danced through the complicated series of movements necessary to complete the operation. When the final suture was placed and the last instrument was laid to rest, Dr. Nick's eyes met those of the experienced nurse who had assisted him throughout the surgery. A slow, knowing smile spread across both of their faces, as they shared a moment of pride and satisfaction in their job well done. The entire medical team could sense that they had just witnessed a historic operation. As Neil was carefully wheeled into the recovery room, Dr. Nick followed closely behind in silence, his mind already racing ahead to the next phase of recovery and rehabilitation for his friend. Neil's recovery process was long and arduous, but he never lost hope. Under the watchful care of Dr. Nick, he witnessed himself making surprising progress. The nanotechnology embedded in his spinal cord began to form new connections, slowly but surely restoring his motor function. With every passing day, he felt stronger, and his confidence grew. As Neil took his first steps after the surgery, he knew a new chapter in his life had begun. The bond between him and Dr. Nick had only strengthened through this process, and they had both gained something invaluable: the gift of hope and the knowledge that innovative medical breakthroughs could truly change lives. Dr. Nick's procedure had indeed achieved flying colors, paving the way for countless other patients to experience its life-altering benefits. As news of the successful operation spread, Dr. Nick and his groundbreaking technique received international recognition. Yet, most important to both Neil and Dr. Nick was the reminder that their enduring friendship and trust in one another had turned a dream into reality. In the end, it was not only Dr. Nick's profound medical expertise but his unwavering belief in the power of innovation and friendship that enabled Neil to embark on this incredible journey toward a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this and answer the question The fourth Digimon series, which began airing on April 7, 2002, radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution, Spirit Evolution, in which the human characters use their D-Tectors (this series' Digivice) to transform themselves into special Digimon called Legendary Warriors, detracting from the customary formula of having digital partners. After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon (one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon) Takuya Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World. Summoned by Ophanimon, the Digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the Digital World. After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights—Dynasmon and Crusadermon—from destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World.

This article: Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

Q: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \\"try and stay away\\" from the Justice Department, but \\"at some point, I...

Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has \\"the power to vanquish the Dark Lord\\". Voldemort does not appear in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders Amelia Bones of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Emmeline Vance. Rowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the pensieve as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch Merope Gaunt and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died, just hours after giving birth. After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts. Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a psychopath who takes sadistic pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him. The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \\"Muggles\\", his obsession with Horcruxes, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality. Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a love potion symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world. In the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by Draco Malfoy, who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school. The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered. Hogwarts professor (and re-doubled agent) Severus Snape uses the Killing Curse against Dumbledore when Draco could not force himself to do so. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Can you provide me with a little information on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince?","completion":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a book where Lord Voldemort, the bad guy, is not seen but his actions are felt. In this book, he starts a war and tries to hurt more people. We also learn about Voldemort's past, like how he was born and grew up in an orphanage before going to a magical school called Hogwarts. In this story, Voldemort's followers, called Death Eaters, manage to get inside Hogwarts, and there is a big fight. At the end of the book, a teacher named Severus Snape uses a very bad spell on Dumbledore, an important and kind character in the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: And the choice for the most powerful post in the EU of a man so blatantly unsuitable for the job is just another symptom of how we are now looking at an increasingly dysfunctional vanity project which is destroying itself from within. Misty morning on Wint Hill in Somerset: the Met Office’s long-term forecasts are often inaccurate Met Office model is sunk by its own data We are familiar with how consistently the Met Office has, in recent years, been getting its seasonal and medium-term weather forecasts so spectacularly wrong. We recall that soaking “barbecue summer” of 2009; their “warmer than average” December 2010, which turned out to be the coldest on record; last year’s “drier than average winter”, which led to the wettest January ever; and many more. In January 2013, I was writing about the “forecast the Met Office hoped you wouldn’t see”, after it had, on Christmas Eve, tried to smuggle out a wholly new version of its computer prediction in 2011 that, over the following five years, global temperatures would rise by 0.8C, greater than the entire net rise in the past century. The Met had amended this, without explanation, to show that the current 17-year “pause” in warming might continue for years to come. Its latest embarrassment, picked up by various climate blogs, led by Die kalte Sonne in Germany, is also worth noting. In 2007, when global warming hysteria was at its height, the foremost US scientific journal, Science, published a paper from a team led by Dr Doug Smith, the Met Office Hadley Centre’s head of “Decadal Climate Prediction”, entitled “Improved surface temperature prediction for the coming decade from a global climate model”. Smith’s computer had shown how temperatures would rise between 2004 and 2014: its central prediction being that the world would heat up by 0.3C, possibly even as much as 0.5C, and that four of the five years after 2009 would break the 1998 record as “the hottest year ever”. What Die kalte Sonne had spotted was that now we are able to compare that computer prediction with what actually happened, as measured on the Hadley Centre’s own Hadcrut temperature record. Overlaying a graph of the real data on those predictions from 2007, it can be seen how, in the past 10 years, average temperatures have slightly fallen. Not one of the past five years has beaten that 1998 record. One reason this is significant, as I noted last year, is that it yet again confirms how seriously the Hadley Centre’s forecasting strategy has been skewed – by the way its computer models are programmed to assume that a steady rise in CO2 levels must inevitably lead to rising temperatures. This is the core reason why it has been getting all those forecasts of “hotter summers” and “drier winters” so dismally wrong. A second point of concern is that the same unquestioned assumption has been allowed damagingly to reshape the energy policy of so many governments, above all our own. Yet, such is the power of group-think, not one of our leading politicians, from Barack (“the science is settled”) Obama down, has had the independence of mind to question that flawed assumption. A third lesson that might emerge from this is that we should recognise that the Met Office’s blind acceptance of this scientific error has – in view of the disastrous influence it exerts on public policy – become a national scandal. In that popular buzz-phrase, the Met Office, for which we pay £200 million a year, has shown itself to be “not fit for purpose”. Yet never, by politicians or even the media, has there been any proper attempt to call it to account. Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Met Office's Inaccurate Temperature Predictions: A National Scandal\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The answer to the question: Whose film score dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance? is inside the article: Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\"Jugband Blues\\": \\"I'm most obliged to you for making..., can you guess it ?

The water that my mom bought was not enough to fill the fish bowl because the Options: A). water was to little.; B). bowl was to little.;","completion":"The water that my mom bought was not enough to fill the fish bowl because the water was too little. This situation can occur due to various reasons; perhaps my mom had underestimated the amount of water required to fill the fishbowl, or she might have miscalculated the fishbowl's dimensions. Regardless of the cause, the outcome remained the same: an insufficient amount of water to accommodate the fish and support their well-being. Let's look at each option in more detail. A) The water was too little. One reason for the water amount being too little could be that the purchased water was not the right volume. Fish require a specific volume of water depending on their species, size, and number, in order to promote a healthy environment and ensure their physical and mental well-being. Water quality and quantity are critical factors in maintaining healthy conditions within a fish habitat. An inadequate amount of water can lead to a rapid deterioration of water quality, causing stressed and unhealthy living conditions for the fish. The amount of water must also be sufficient enough to facilitate the natural biological filtration process, which helps in eliminating harmful substances such as ammonia, nitrite, and nitrates. If my mom had bought distilled water or a specialized water treatment solution, it's essential to understand that the purchased volume should be adequate to provide for the requirements of the fish. Moreover, creating a stable environment that simulates the natural habitat for the fish should entail a proper balance between water volume, temperature, pH, and other critical factors. B) The bowl was too little. While the initial issue revolves around the insufficient amount of water, it is also worth considering the possibility of the bowl itself being too small for the fish. A small fishbowl imposes various limitations that may affect the fish's health and overall well-being, such as the lack of space for swimming, inadequate surface area for oxygen exchange, and a greater likelihood of rapid water contamination. Smaller bowls tend to lack the necessary resources to accommodate essential aquarium equipment such as heaters, filters, and air pumps. These devices play a crucial role in maintaining a stable environment and keeping the water quality within safe parameters, ensuring that the fish thrive in their habitat. Conclusively, having the right amount of water in an appropriately sized bowl is crucial for the overall health, happiness, and longevity of the fish. It's essential for anyone who intends to keep fish as pets to take into account all aspects of fish care, including investing in the right-sized fishbowl and providing a sufficient amount of water. By doing so, we can offer our aquatic pets a loving and healthy home, while also enjoying the beauty and tranquility they bring into our lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween.

A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Austin is in the process of stealing valuables from Tracy's purse without her consent. In this situation, several potential outcomes could occur for Tracy depending on various factors. Here is a detailed analysis considering different possibilities: 1. Emotional consequences: Initially, Tracy might be shocked and devastated to see her possessions being taken away by Austin. She might feel a mix of feelings, including betrayal, anger, fear, and sadness. This event can lead to a sense of insecurity, especially if it occurred in a place she considered safe, and might create trust issues. 2. Financial loss: Depending on the type and value of the items in her purse, Tracy could face considerable financial losses. If her purse contained cash, credit cards, and other valuables - like jewelry or a smartphone - the theft's immediate financial impact could be significant. This loss might result in her temporarily struggling to make ends meet or even facing more long-term financial stress. 3. Identity theft risk: One major concern for Tracy would be if her personal identification documents, such as a driver's license, social security card, or passport, were also in the purse. In this case, having this sensitive information in the hands of a thief puts her at risk for identity theft, which can take a long time to rectify and cause additional damage to her financial and emotional well-being. 4. Possible disruption of routine: Depending on the contents of her purse, Tracy might have to take care of tasks like replacing her stolen phone, canceling and reissuing credit cards, reporting her lost IDs to the relevant authorities, informing her bank and other relevant institutions about the theft, getting a new purse, and replacing any other essential items in her purse. These tasks can ultimately cause inconvenience and disrupt her daily routines. 5. Social consequences: Given the context, it is not clear whether Austin and Tracy have a personal relationship or if this incident is the act of a stranger. If Austin is a friend, family member, or acquaintance, this event would negatively impact their relationship going forward. In this case, Tracy would likely reconsider her association with Austin, reevaluate her trust, and possibly avoid any future contact. If Austin is a stranger, Tracy may still feel heightened fear and anxiety in public spaces, possibly affecting her social interactions. 6. Legal repercussions: Depending on the circumstances and how Tracy chooses to approach the situation, there could be legal implications for both the victim and the perpetrator. Tracy may decide to report the theft to the police and press charges against Austin, leading to potential criminal charges and a lengthy legal process. This legal action can result in both expected and unexpected ramifications for Tracy, such as additional stress, time consumed in the legal proceedings, and potential dissatisfaction with the outcome. In conclusion, the specific events that might unfold after Austin's theft of valuables from Tracy's purse are uncertain. However, it is clear that Tracy would suffer various hardships, including emotional distress, financial loss, disruption in her daily life, potential legal pursuits, and possible negative social impacts. Each of these consequences would vary based on numerous factors, such as the value of stolen possessions, the relationship between Tracy and Austin, and Tracy's decisions about how to handle the aftermath of the theft."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The smooth-cheeked butcher known as \\"El Ponchis,\\" the target of a manhunt since October, was busted this week as he tried to flee Mexico with his big sister to their stepmother's home in San Diego, authorities said. He worked as a hit kid for a savage Mexican drug operation, the cartel of the South Pacific, until he was nabbed at a Mexican airport late Thursday. The pubescent thug was reportedly abetted by his 16-year-old sis - who dumped victims' headless bodies on streets and freeways in Cuernavaca, a source told The Associated Press. Other reports indicated the young killer used his sister as a decoy to lure his victims. They collected 3,000 per murder. The boy, identified by authorities only as Edgar, confessed his role in the gruesome killings to reporters at the Mexican attorney general's office, declaring that his first taste of homicide came at age 11. \\"I participated in four executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me,\\" he explained yesterday in a cool voice. After he apologized for the slayings, reporters asked the youth what he would do if released. \\"I'll go on the straight and narrow,\\" he promised. \\"I'll work in anything else except this.\\" The alleged teen killer - whose nickname is Spanish for \\"The Cloaked One\\" - was born in San Diego in July 1996, according to Mexican officials. He had been picked up with a half-dozen other gang members in October, but released by military forces who were duped by his youthfulness. Mexican media reports indicated he had dodged capture by authorities four times since then - including a narrow escape last weekend in a Mexican Army raid at a strip club called Fantassy. The reputed assassin, whose existence was considered more rumor than reality by many, was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt when he was apprehended. He and his sister are suspected of working for Julio (El Negro) Padilla, who is fighting for control of the cartel once headed by drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva. The leadership void came after Beltran Leyva was killed last year by Mexican Marines. El Ponchis and his sibling already had plane tickets when they were taken into custody, with the sister saying their mother had sent money to cover the cost. A third sibling traveling with them was not linked to the cartel or the killings, authorities said. What was this article about?","completion":"This article, originally published on December 3, 2010, describes the apprehension of a 14-year-old, American-born contract killer nicknamed \\"El Ponchis\\" in Mexico. The young boy admitted to committing four drug-war decapitations while working for a Mexican drug cartel called the South Pacific. He claimed to have been drugged and coerced into carrying out the murders, starting at the age of 11. His 16-year-old sister allegedly aided him in disposing of the headless bodies of his victims in Cuernavaca. El Ponchis was arrested near a Mexican airport, as he attempted to flee to San Diego along with his sister. The siblings were suspected of working for a drug lord named Julio Padilla, who was in a power struggle over the cartel leadership after the previous leader, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in 2009. El Ponchis and his sister were apprehended before they could board a plane. A third sibling with them was not implicated in the crimes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the Jets flew to Land Shark Stadium for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with their AFC East rival, the Miami Dolphins. New York immediately trailed as the Dolphins took the game's opening drive and capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run from running Ronnie Brown. The Jets immediately responded with rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to newly acquired wide receiver Braylon Edwards. Afterwards, Miami closed out the opening quarter with a 35-yard field goal from kicker Dan Carpenter. In the second quarter, New York took the lead as kicker Jay Feely got a 40-yard and a 43-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, both the Jets and the Dolphins would get involved in a back-and-forth fourth quarter. Miami opened up the period with quarterback Chad Henne hooking up with tight end Anthony Fasano on a 2-yard touchdown pass, while New York got a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Thomas Jones. The Dolphins would immediately respond as Henne threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., but Jones came through again with a 3-yard touchdown run. Late in the game, Miami managed to crack through the Jets' defense as Brown got a 2-yard touchdown run. New York tried to rally, but Sanchez's last-second hail mary pass was knocked away. How many yards longer was Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown compared to Ronnie Brown's first touchdown?","completion":"Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown was a 53-yard pass, while Ronnie Brown's first touchdown was a 1-yard run. To find out how many yards longer Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown was, you can subtract the yards of Ronnie Brown's touchdown from Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown. So, 53 (yards by Ted Ginn) - 1 (yard by Ronnie Brown) = 52 yards. Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown was 52 yards longer than Ronnie Brown's first touchdown."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the given equation -32120*m + 871 = -32053*m for m, follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the terms containing m on both sides of the equation. On the left side, the term is -32120*m. On the right side, the term is -32053*m. Step 2: Move all the terms containing m to one side of the equation. To do this, add 32053*m to both sides of the equation, effectively isolating the m terms to one side of the equation. -32120*m + 32053*m + 871= -32053*m + 32053*m This simplifies to: -67*m + 871 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 871 from both sides of the equation: -67*m + 871 - 871 = 0 - 871 This simplifies to: -67*m = -871 Step 4: Divide both sides by -67 to solve for m. m = (-871) / (-67) Now, calculate the value of m: m ≈ 13 So, the solution to the equation -32120*m + 871 = -32053*m is m ≈ 13."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Outside the fire and away from everyone else, Don does a little research and finds out that the man was a thief who stole a large amount of gold valuables from a church and hid them in a building in East St. Louis. The two decide to drive there, thinking they can get there, get the gold, and get back in one day. While looking around in the abandoned building, they are spotted by a gang, led by King James (Ice-T), who is there to execute an enemy. Vince and Don witness the murder, but give themselves away and only manage to force a stalemate when they grab Lucky (De'voreaux White), King James' half-brother.

Brian lived in a suburb in the city. (ii). Matthew lived in a suburb in the city.","completion":"Brian always drank from fresh coconuts unlike Matthew because, unlike his friend, Brian was fortunate to live in an exotic location where coconut trees were abundant and commonly found in his surroundings. This provided him with easy access to fresh coconuts which he enjoyed regularly. Matthew, on the other hand, lived in a suburb in the city where fresh coconuts were harder to come by, as they needed to be transported from other places, leading to a decrease in freshness and potentially higher prices due to transportation costs. In addition to their differing living environments, Brian's exposure to the tropical climate and local culture shaped his preference for fresh coconuts as a natural and healthy source of hydration and nutrients. Not only were they a resource that could be readily harvested from his own backyard, but they also became a part of his daily routine, embodying the essence of living closer to nature. This lifestyle provided Brian with the opportunity to consume coconuts that had not gone through any packaging or processing, which meant that he was consuming them at their most natural and beneficial state. Matthew, living in a city suburb, was more likely to experience limited access to fresh coconuts as well as a lack of familiarity with the practice of consuming them regularly. Supermarkets and grocery stores in urban areas might stock coconuts, but they are not always guaranteed to be fresh or equivalent to the quality of those from their natural source. Additionally, the culture and lifestyle in city suburbs do not usually encourage or emphasize the consumption of fresh coconuts as it does in tropical regions. Furthermore, city dwellers like Matthew may have less awareness regarding the benefits of drinking directly from fresh coconuts, and might opt more readily for bottled coconut water or other packaged varieties that can easily be found on store shelves. This convenience, though it offers a level of accessibility, does not provide the same nutrient-rich experience as the fresh coconuts Brian was able to enjoy. Furthermore, it should also be mentioned that Brian's preference for fresh coconuts stemmed not only from geographical factors but may also have been influenced by a personal inclination towards choosing healthier, more organic, and environmentally-friendly sources of nutrition and hydration. This preference would be further reinforced by his living conditions that provided ample opportunities to connect with nature and understand the value of wholesome food sources. Meanwhile, Matthew's city-based lifestyle may have contributed to his drinking choices being different from Brian's, due to the prominence and reliance on processed and packaged products. In conclusion, Brian always drank from fresh coconuts unlike Matthew because of the differences in their living environments, cultural influences, accessibility to fresh coconuts, and personal preferences shaped by their surroundings. While Brian enjoyed the luxury of fresh coconuts right from the source, Matthew had to navigate an urban landscape where fresh coconuts were not as easily available, often resulting in alternative choices to find coconut-based hydration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band? is inside the article: After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

Step 3: Determine which gas is given off when the beach ball explodes We know that a beach ball contains gas, but it is not specified which type of gas. However, most beach balls are usually inflated with air, which is a mixture of several gases like nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor.

ORLANDO, Fla. - A federal agent accidentally shot himself in the foot at Orlando International Airport Tuesday morning as he was heading to the security checkpoint, Orlando police and a spokesperson with the airport confirmed to News 6. Orlando police said that the gun fell out of the agent's holster as he was adjusting a bag, and went off when he went to grab it. The bullet hit the agent in the foot and was later found a few feet away, police said. No one else was hurt during this incident, according to authorities. The gun went off at Terminal A near the security checkpoint for gates 70 to 129. News 6 spoke with a woman who was waiting for her flight just a few feet away when it happened. \\"I was a little taken back that nobody was moving,\\" Jenny Fulks said. Fulks, of Denver, said she arrived early for her flight when she heard the gunshot from about 20 feet away. \\"I heard a loud bang and I know that noise, I've heard it before,\\" said Fulks.

A spokesperson for the Orlando International Airport says this was an isolated incident and that there was no disruption to airline operations.

They were right. A federal agent had accidentally shot himself in the left foot, having somehow dislodged his holstered pistol and pulling the trigger while grasping for the weapon. It happened on the busy ticketing and departure floor in the multistory atrium at the Hyatt Regency, the noise sounding like a large board falling on tile flooring.

They calmly approached and then questioned the man who would later be treated for a gunshot. He did not appear to be in distress, but the scene began to draw attention from throngs of passengers and airport workers. At 40 minutes before noon, the crowd passing through the nearby security check was lighter than earlier in the morning. Ultimately, a mass of law enforcement converged, including an Orlando police officer on a bike and another in plain clothes, and Homeland Security officers. Police there said the man, with a shaved head and gray goatee, was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent from Kansas City on vacation. The immigration agency did not respond to a request for comment. About an hour later, the police department issued a statement, identifying him as a federal agent, saying that while “unslinging a shoulder bag, the bag caught on the agent's holstered weapon.�? “While the weapon was falling, the agent tried to catch the firearm and inadvertently pulled the trigger.

Step 1: Saliva breaking down chemicals in food - If more digestion occurs at this stage, it could mean more enzymes are present in the saliva, allowing for a more efficient breakdown of food. Step 2: Tongue and teeth breaking down food - If more digestion occurs at this stage, it could mean the food is being chewed more thoroughly and broken down into smaller particles. Step 3: Esophagus - If more digestion were to occur in this stage, it could indicate that food moves through the esophagus more efficiently or quickly, allowing for quicker transit to the stomach. Step 4: Stomach - If more digestion occurs in the stomach, it could mean that gastric juices and muscle contractions work more effectively in breaking down food. Step 5: Intestines - If more digestion occurs in the intestines, it could indicate that the absorption of nutrients and remaining digestion processes work more efficiently. Now, considering the question: If more digestion occurs, how will it affect LESS digestion occurring? Answer: B: less If more digestion occurs, it implies that the digestive system is working more efficiently and effectively in breaking down food and absorbing the necessary nutrients. In this scenario, LESS digestion occurring would be negatively affected, as the overall digestive process has improved and become more efficient in comparison to a less efficient (or less digesting) scenario."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\" Question: \\"What agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston?\\" Answer: \\"NLAP\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Select from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"(2). yes; The correct answer is \\"yes.\\" The paragraph states that NLAP (Neighborhood Legal Assistance Program) used a 50,000 LSC (Legal Services Corporation) grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston.

What is the answer for the question: What does the butler's ex wife ask The Lone Wolf to do? from the following article ? In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard suspects Michael Lanyard, the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen. Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom. Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone. Woolerton claims Robards pushed him out of the car on the outskirts, and said he suspects Lanyard was the murderer.","completion":"In the given article, the butler's ex-wife, actress Iris Chatham, does not directly ask The Lone Wolf, Michael Lanyard, to do anything. However, we can infer that she has some intentions based on her actions. Iris invites Lanyard to the theater that night, where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscott family. This could be an attempt to keep Lanyard away from the ongoing plans and manipulations that involve Robards stealing the Eyes of the Nile for her. To provide more context, Iris Chatham has left her former husband, Henry Robards (the butler), and run off with Monty Beresford, who financed the stage production that made her a star. Robards is heartbroken and wants to reconcile with her. Iris, however, demands something from him first. This something seems to be the priceless diamonds, the Eyes of the Nile, which Robards steals from Lanyard's packet of jewels. Iris Chatham may have asked Lanyard to stay away from the Kelmscotts to avoid any interference with her and Robards' plan to obtain the Eyes of the Nile. This is supported by the fact that soon after, Robards dies mysteriously with the jewels still in his possession, but the Eyes of the Nile missing. Ultimately, the butler's ex-wife, Iris Chatham, doesn’t have a direct request for The Lone Wolf. Instead, she indirectly manipulates the situation and keeps Lanyard away from the Kelmscotts to ensure her and Robards' plan to steal the Eyes of the Nile goes as smoothly as possible."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For preparing for the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in commerce, it is important to choose a book that provides comprehensive coverage of relevant topics and follows the syllabus prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). One highly recommended book for this purpose is \\"Trueman's UGC NET Commerce\\" by Parveen Kataria, Anshu Kataria, and M. Shivani. This book has been widely acclaimed for its extensive content, self-explanatory language, and question papers from previous years. Another good option for preparing for the JRF in commerce is \\"UGC NET/JRF/SLET Commerce for Paper 2\\" by Dr. L. K. Jha. This book offers a thorough analysis of various topics and a systematic approach to mastering the subject. It also covers the latest syllabus as prescribed by the UGC, making it an excellent resource for candidates. Apart from these books, it is also beneficial to refer to the National Testing Agency (NTA) website for subject-specific study materials, practice tests, and sample questions. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly read updates on commerce and economics from relevant academic journals and published papers to keep abreast of the latest developments in the field. Remember, consistent practice and proper time management are crucial for success in the JRF examination. Second question: The software of the advanced system optimizer's register number. Advanced System Optimizer is a software utility program designed to optimize the performance of your computer by cleaning, maintaining, and securing the system. It is developed by Systweak Software, a well-known company in the field of software development. The \\"register number\\" you are referring to is most likely the license key or registration code required to activate the full version of Advanced System Optimizer. If you have purchased the software, the license key or registration code should have been emailed to you from the manufacturer after successful purchase. If you have misplaced the key, you can contact the Systweak support team for assistance in recovering your registration information. It is essential to note that sharing, distributing, or using pirated license keys is illegal and unethical. It is always recommended to purchase the software from a reliable source to support the developers and enjoy continuous updates and support. Answering the question \\"are these two questions asking the same thing?\\": a). no. These two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is inquiring about the best book for preparing for the JRF in commerce, while the second question is asking for the software of Advanced System Optimizer's register number (which likely means the license key or registration code). These two topics are unrelated, as one pertains to academic preparation in the field of commerce, while the other relates to a specific software utility program for optimizing computer systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the King of France? ? Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

UPDATED:. 08:09 EST, 23 October 2012. Ceefax will take its final bow tonight as the beloved text service succumbs to the final stage of the UK's switch to digital television broadcasts. The world's first teletext service will finally end after 38 years on the BBC when Olympic champion Dame Mary Peters switches off analogue transmissions in Northern Ireland. As the corporation prepared to finally pull the plug on the service, the Plain English Campaign announced a lifetime achievement award for its 'clarity' and use of 'everyday words' One of the very last pages from Ceefax to air on BBC Two: The service will finally be switched off in Northern Ireland tonight after 38 years of broadcasts on the BBC. Former prime minister Sir John Major said it would be 'much missed' and could be 'proud of its record' of offering an 'instant window on the world'. Launched September 23 1974, Ceefax gave viewers the chance to check the latest headlines, weather forecasts and TV listings in a pre-internet era where the only alternative was to wait for the next bulletin to be aired. Initially developed by BBC engineers looking for ways to transmit subtitles, Ceefax was made possible by exploiting 'spare lines' in the analogue television signal that broadcast encoded information. Its first editor was veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, a former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer who initally updated 24 news pages himself by feeding punch tape into machines. Old school: Launched September 23 1974, Ceefax gave viewers the chance to check the latest headlines, weather forecasts and TV listings in a pre-internet era.

The. launch of the UK's digital television signal, which can carry much more. information, and the announcement of the staged switch-off of the. analogue TV signal tolled the death knell for the service. Popular: Audience figures peaked in the Nineties when Ceefax had 20million users who checked it at least once a week. Unprecedented: The full service included recipes for dishes prepared on BBC cookery programmes, share prices, music reviews, Blue Peter project how-to's and an annual advent calendar. The service's first editor was veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, a former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer who initally updated 24 news pages himself by feeding punch tape into machines. End of an era: Special broadcasts will tonight mark the end of the Ceefax service. BBC Northern Ireland and UTV will tonight screen a simulcast reviewing the era of analogue TV and Dame Mary Peters - 1972 Olympic gold medallist in the pentathlon - will push the button ending the transmission at 11:30. These days when online journalists want to publish stories, all they have to do is click a button on screen to make a story live and viewable by readers all across the planet. By comparison, the early days of Ceefax proved anything but hi-tech. Journalists at the BBC Newsroom would monitor stories coming in on the wires, and when a story was to be updated they would type at a production terminal to create a Ceefax page. Then they had to produce a yard-long punched tape before running down two flights of stairs to the BBC's Central Apparatus Room and load into a reader which actually transmitted the pages. After returning to the news room they checked for mistakes. If, at that point, a spelling mistake was found the journalist had to go through the whole process again. Viewers can check Ceefax itself during the evening to see a special graphics countdown on page 100. Meanwhile BBC weather presenters will pay tribute to the service by using Ceefax-type pixelated maps on the forecasts. The Plain English campaign also paid tribute to the service with a lifetime achievement award recognising its commitment to communicating information to viewers as quickly and clearly as possible. Responding to the accolade Steve Herrmann, editor of the BBC News website, said: 'It is an honour for us to receive this lifetime achievement award, and it stands as a tribute to all the journalists who have worked on the service over the years, and the care they have taken in writing every story.' Former prime minister Sir John Major, who has previously told how he checked Ceefax pages to keep up to date with cricket scores between Downing Street meetings said the service will be 'much missed'. 'At moments of high pressure - with little time for detailed examination of the news - Ceefax headlines offered an instant window on the world,' he said. 'From breaking global news to domestic sports news, Ceefax was speedy, accurate and indispensable. It can be proud of its record.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

The answer to the question: In what year did the song Symfonin reach top of the Swedish singles charts at the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts? is inside the article: Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The song \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman reached the top of the Swedish singles charts in 1990 after participating in Melodifestivalen, the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts. Although the song finished last in the competition, it still managed to achieve significant domestic record sales, demonstrating the impact of the competition on the Swedish music industry. Melodifestivalen has been responsible for propelling the careers of many popular Swedish artists, not just limited to the winners, and has become an iconic event in the Swedish entertainment scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It all ended in smiles, but when Sydney Sixers opener Riki Wessels was cracked in the head by a 144.7 km/h delivery in his side’s Big Bash match there was a sharp intake of breath all around the Adelaide Oval. The tragic death of Australian batsman Philip Hughes last November when he was struck in the head by a similar ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott is still fresh in the memory, and since then there has been a lot of debate and controversy over the kind of helmets being used today. In this instance Wessels’ helmet did its job. The 29-year-old was struck on Saturday night by a bouncer from Adelaide paceman Kane Richardson in the fourth over with the ball getting lodged between the peak of his helmet and the protective face grill. Scroll down for video. Riki Wessels gets hit in the head by a 144.7 km/h bouncer from bowler Kane Richardson. Wessels tried to take evasive action but couldn't get out of the way in time. The Sydney Sixers opener spins away after getting struck but there's no sign of the ball. Wessels soon realises where the ball is - lodged in the grill of his helmet. Wessels kissed his helmet in relief immediately afterwards and he was only half joking when he did it. Richardson’s 144.7 km/h delivery was pitched straight at him and the ball was heading directly for his forehead. Only the protective grill saved him from serious injury, so it was no wonder he was thankful. Wessels had even more reason to be grateful as he came in for more punishment just a few overs later when he was struck again on the helmet by a Shaun Tait delivery. Sealed with a kiss: Wessels gratefully kisses his helmet after it did its job. Adelaide's Richardson comes over to check Wessels' welfare after hitting him with the delivery. In the same match retiring fast bowler Brett Lee showed there was still life in the old dog yet after one of his trademark blistering deliveries smashed Craig Simmons' bat. The 38-year-old Sydney Sixers star will retire at the end of his side's Big Bash campaign, but he stunned Adelaide's Simmons with a 149km/h yorker in the opening over, snapping his bat in two.

Given the question: Cells cannot survive without oxygen, and air contains oxygen. Given these facts, what helps cells survive among the following options: - DNA - all copper - air - space - RNA - coat - heat - gasoline The answer is:","completion":"Air. Air is the most critical element among the given options that helps cells survive. This is because air contains oxygen, which is an essential component for the survival and functioning of cells. The other options provided, such as DNA, RNA, copper, space, coat, heat, and gasoline, do not directly supply the cells with the vital oxygen they need for their survival. Oxygen is needed for cellular respiration, a process through which cells generate energy for their various functions. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, where glucose and oxygen react to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water. ATP is the source of energy that cells rely on to perform their necessary functions such as growth, repair, and reproduction. Without a continuous supply of oxygen, this process would be brought to a halt, and the cells in an organism would ultimately die. Air comprises around 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, and 1% other gases, such as argon and carbon dioxide. The oxygen in the air is transported to cells through the process of respiration in organisms. In the case of humans, for example, air is inhaled through the mouth or nose and then passes through the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles before reaching the alveoli in the lungs. Here, the oxygen in the air diffuses into the bloodstream through tiny capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin within red blood cells. These oxygen-carrying red blood cells are then pumped throughout the body by the heart, delivering oxygen to each cell. Although DNA and RNA are essential molecules in cells, they are not directly responsible for the delivery or supply of oxygen. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) encodes the genetic information required for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) acts as a messenger, transferring genetic instructions from DNA to protein-producing organelles called ribosomes. Copper, coat, heat, and gasoline are unrelated to the supply of oxygen to cells. Copper is an essential trace element involved in numerous biological processes, but it does not directly provide oxygen for cellular respiration. A coat is an external item that may keep an organism warm, but it does not contribute to oxygen delivery. Heat is essential to maintain an optimal body temperature for enzyme activity but does not supply cells with oxygen. Gasoline is a fuel used in combustion engines and is not essential for cell survival. In conclusion, air is the primary factor among the given options that enables cells to survive. It provides the necessary oxygen required for cellular respiration and the production of energy in the form of ATP, which cells rely on for their essential functions. The other options, while important in their own right, do not directly supply cells with the vital oxygen they need to survive."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where was Hebrew used for studying Biblical texts in their original language before Yale?\\" is in \\"Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Almost 250 different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed \\"Black Saturday\\", more than 150,000 acres (610 km2) were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings, Montana, 60 miles (97 km) to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6 km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61 m) high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) a day, and there were even occasions when more than 2 miles (3.2 km) in one hour were recorded.One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the southern section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and like the Shoshone fire, advanced little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19, and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village... Answer:","completion":"The two fires that advanced towards the Grant Village area in Yellowstone National Park during the summer of 1988 were the Shoshone Fire and the Red Fire. Both fires were part of the larger Snake River Complex and were initially started by lightning strikes. The Shoshone Fire began on June 23, and due to the prescribed natural burn policy in place at the time, no immediate efforts were made to suppress it. The fire smoldered and remained relatively contained for several weeks before rapidly expanding towards the northeast on July 20. The Red Fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and similarly, it advanced little for several weeks. However, on July 19, it began moving northeast and eventually combined with the Shoshone Fire in August. As both fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, they posed a significant threat to the park's infrastructure and natural resources. The summer of 1988 saw nearly 250 fires ignited in and around Yellowstone, with seven of them accounting for 95% of the total burned area. Among these fires, the Snake River Complex was one of the most significant, as it affected the southern section of the park. The confluence of the Shoshone and Red Fires in close proximity to Grant Village made them particularly dangerous to the park's infrastructure and required the mobilization of personnel from the National Park Service and other agencies to attempt to bring the fires under control. Despite these efforts, the fires continued to expand, fueled by dry storms that brought strong winds and lightning but no rain. The fires eventually became so intense that they created crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61 meters) high, spreading rapidly across the park's landscape and threatening both natural habitats and human-built structures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

Despite the two sentences using different word orders, both are communicating that the Pike County School System is composed of a total of 25 schools that include elementary, middle, and high schools. In the first sentence: \\"The Pike County School System consists of 25 high schools, middle and elementary schools,\\" the mention of \\"high schools, middle and elementary schools\\" is a little ambiguous, so it could be misunderstood to mean that there are 25 high schools alone and an unspecified number of middle and elementary schools. On the other hand, the second sentence: \\"The Pike County School System consists of 25 elementary, middle, and high schools,\\" it is clear that it is referring to a collective total of 25 schools, not individually 25 of each type. However, given that we are considering the intent of the sentences rather than focusing on their possible ambiguity, we can conclude that both sentences are intended to communicate the same meaning, which is the total number of schools in the Pike County School System. The potential ambiguity arises due to the slight deviations in word order and sentence structure, but with full context, one would understand that both sentences mean the same thing. So while based on strict interpretation there may seem to be a difference, in actuality, both sentences refer to the same entity - The Pike County School System - with 25 schools in total including high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions? Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","completion":"Bob's town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions, as it was located in a hilly area with more precipitation and full of bike trails."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Select from: (I) before the oceans (II) in the earth (III) after the oceans (IV) in the oceans","completion":"To determine which choice is the correct answer, we will go through each one of them step by step: 1. \\"Before the oceans\\" does not make any sense, as there is no specific location or reservoir of carbon referred to by this statement. It is not clear if it refers to a geological time period or a source of carbon preceding the oceans. So we can rule out option (I). 2. \\"In the earth\\" as an option might refer to carbon stored in fossil fuels, which could be a reasonable choice. However, the question asks where the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by a carbon reservoir, so we need to consider if this is the most significant reservoir. Thus, we will keep option (II) for the time being. 3. \\"After the oceans\\" is another vague choice, and once again, it is not clear what source of carbon this statement refers to, nor does it correspond to a particular CO2 reservoir. Therefore, we can eliminate option (III). 4. \\"In the oceans\\" is a well-defined location, and it is scientifically accurate to consider the oceans as a carbon reservoir. This reservoir is important, as CO2 dissolves in the water, making oceans a significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. After carefully analyzing each option, we reach the conclusion that option (IV) \\"in the oceans\\" is the correct answer as it is the most significant reservoir of carbon that influences the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: - The body&#x27;s temperature increases over 98.6 degrees F - The hypothalamus in the brain sends a message to the body - Sweat glands in the skin receive the message - The sweat glands start combining water and chemicals to make sweat What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process, after the sweat glands have combined water and chemicals to create sweat, is the excretion and evaporation of sweat from the skin's surface to facilitate cooling and regulate body temperature. This process is essential to maintaining a stable and healthy internal environment, or homeostasis, within the body. As sweat is produced by the sweat glands, it travels through ducts and is secreted onto the surface of the skin. In response to the increased body temperature, the sweat glands work to produce a higher volume of sweat. The sweat on the skin's surface then absorbs the excess heat from the body, and as it evaporates, it dissipates the heat into the air, cooling the skin and, in turn, cooling the blood circulating near the skin's surface. Blood vessels in the skin also play a crucial role in this final step by dilating, allowing more blood flow to the skin's surface. This increase in blood flow supports the removal of excess heat through the evaporation of sweat. As the body temperature starts to decrease and approach the normal range, the hypothalamus regulates both the production of sweat and the dilation of the blood vessels, gradually returning physiological processes to normal levels. In addition, the evaporation of sweat has a cooling effect not just on the skin but also on the surrounding environment. This helps to lower the air temperature around the skin as well, further contributing to the overall cooling effect on the body. In summary, the final step of the process involves the excretion of sweat onto the skin's surface, followed by the evaporation of sweat, which effectively cools the body by dissipating excess heat into the air. This mechanism of thermoregulation is crucial in maintaining homeostasis and ensuring that the body's vital functions and organs operate optimally even in the presence of elevated temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One invented hundreds of uses for peanuts , while the other led some kind of army across America. I looked at the screen, wondering which one my teacher meant. I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice: let the coin decide. I flipped a coin and ah! Tails ! My report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter, George Washington Carver. Weeks later, I stood in front of the classroom and proudly read my homework. But things started to get strange. I looked around the room, only to find my classmates with big smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes and my stone-faced teacher. I was completely lost. \\"What could be causing everyone to act this way?\\" Oh well, I dropped the paper and sat down at my desk, burning to find out what I had done wrong. As a classmate began his report, it all became clear, \\"My report is on George Washington, the man who started the American War of Independence.\\" The whole world became quiet! How could I know that my teacher meant that George Washington? Of course, my subject result was awful. Sad but fearless, I decided to turn this around.

But Frank Willett, a Dunkirk and Normandy veteran, did - and was exploited by his neighbour Colin Blake. Frank's daughter, Lesley, lived 300 miles away from her father. She was in South Wales and he was in Yorkshire. Suffering from dementia and in his early 80s, in 2003 Frank made Blake his attorney, giving him responsibility for his financial affairs. Blake had befriended widower Mr Willett and took him to a local solicitor's office, where the document was drawn up for enduring power of attorney and Frank signed. Lesley and her husband Brian Felton believed Frank's assets were safe. But what they didn't realise was that just weeks after the papers were signed, Colin Blake had begun taking out large sums of money. \\"I didn't think the bank would allow wholesale looting of someone's account,\\" Lesley says. Her father had been a regular customer for years with the bank. He'd go in every week and cash a cheque for £70, and all of his bills were paid by direct debit. He had pensions from the army and the civil service as well as his state pension. He was careful with money and had built up substantial savings of £60,000. In February 2003, Blake withdrew nearly £9,000 from Mr Willett's account in a single transaction. As he had power of attorney, the bank didn't contact Brian and Lesley. Blake drew out more money, using the sums to pay his own bills. Frank's health deteriorated and in September 2004 he was moved to a care home. Colin Blake registered the enduring power of attorney (EPA) with the Court of Protection, which allowed him to sell Frank's house, a two-bedroom bungalow in North Yorkshire. Lesley and Brian challenged the power of attorney in court - but they had no idea that Frank's savings account was empty, and they couldn't prove that Colin Blake was unfit to be Frank's attorney. The judge upheld the document, although he did order Blake to provide annual accounts to the court - a more stringent measure than the usual procedure. The couple and their solicitor repeatedly contacted the Public Guardianship Office, and the Court of Protection, which oversees attorneyship, saying they believed there were discrepancies in the accounts. But they were told everything was satisfactory. In early 2007, visiting her father in the care home in Yorkshire, Lesley learned that Blake was selling his own house, liquidating his company and moving to France. Frank's care bills were in arrears. Lesley knew her father's house had been sold for over £130,000 and could not understand where the money had gone. It was only in early 2008 that a new body - the Office of the Public Guardian - investigated, and revoked the power of attorney. Lesley was appointed deputy by the court instead - responsible for her father's finances under the court's supervision. She discovered all of her father's money had gone. Her father's medals - from 35 years service in the army - had gone. Her mother's wedding ring and her jewellery and all the family photographs and documents had also disappeared. \\"It was devastating,\\" she says. \\"It took his memories.\\" She called the police, who began to investigate Blake. Lesley visited Frank for his birthday and took him to visit her mother's grave. She told him Blake wouldn't be bothering him any more, and that the care home staff and his family would be protecting him. \\"He had tears streaming down his face and he said: 'That's the best birthday present I've ever had.'\\" Frank died in 2009. Lesley and Brian had to go to court to overturn a will Frank had made under Blake's influence. The police pursued Blake to France. Last month he pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years. It's unlikely that Lesley will ever get any money back. But she wanted to see justice done for her father, and for others to learn from her experience. Since this case, there have been changes to power of attorney and the Court of Protection. In the past, a EPA could be drawn up with little oversight - but when it came to registration, it could be subject to scrutiny and challenge. All the relatives of the person concerned would be contacted at that point. Now with the newer Lasting Power of Attorney, or LPA, a professional, or someone who has known the subject of the order well for years, has to provide a certificate for the document to be drawn up - but registration has been made far simpler. Relatives are no longer contacted. Also, the Office of the Public Guardian, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, has more powers to investigate complaints about attorneys than its predecessor, the Public Guardianship Office. The retired judge, Denzil Lush, cited a recent case involving 94-year-old widow Gladys Meek, from Derbyshire. Her husband's niece and great niece were deputies. They used her money to buy cars, laptops, designer handbags, and season tickets to Derby County Football Club. But after a court decision, a £275,000 bond was called in and so the money could be recovered.

The text does not mention a psychologist playing a role in recommending a physical therapist. Rather, it provides guidance on how to use physical therapy to relieve back pain and suggests seeking a recommendation from a doctor, not a psychologist. The text offers a step-by-step approach to using physical therapy for back pain relief: 1. Choose a physical therapist who specializes in back pain treatment 2. Make an appointment with your doctor to get a prescription for physical therapy 3. Ask the doctor to recommend physical therapists with extensive experience in treating cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spinal pain The focus in the text is on relying on a doctor's advice in finding the right physical therapist for back pain treatment, as opposed to consulting a psychologist. It is important to note that the roles of psychologists and doctors are distinct. Psychologists specialize in understanding human behavior, thoughts, and emotions. They typically work in the mental health field and hold a PsyD or Ph.D. in psychology. In contrast, doctors are medical professionals who diagnose and treat a wide range of physical ailments, including managing pain prescriptions and referrals to specialists. In the context of seeking recommendations for physical therapists with experience in back pain, a doctor would be the most appropriate professional to consult. While a psychologist may be able to help with the emotional and mental aspects of dealing with chronic pain, they are not medical professionals with direct expertise in the area of physical therapy or back pain treatment.

(Jude's reaction to the trigger event) 5: But when he calmed down, he learned to not be a snob anymore. (Jude's transformation) Upon analyzing the sentences, it appears that the story is already in a coherent order and there is no need to swap any of the sentences. The storyline flows smoothly: it introduces Jude's snobbish behavior, presents a trigger event, showcases Jude's reaction, and then concludes with his transformation.

Q:Information: - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Nickel is a chemical element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickeliron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere. - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec) were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - Greater Sudbury, commonly referred to as Sudbury, is a city in Ontario, Canada. It is the largest city in Northern Ontario by population, (2011 census population 160,274,) and is the 24th largest metropolitan area in Canada. By land area, it is the largest city in Ontario and the seventh largest municipality by area in Canada. It is administratively a single-tier municipality, and thus not part of any district, county, or regional municipality. - Heavy water (deuterium oxide) is a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (or D, also known as \\"heavy hydrogen\\"), rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope (or H, also called protium) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal \\"light water\\". - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada. At a land area of approximately and a 2011 population of 41,462, it is the second largest and most populous of the three territories in Northern Canada. Its estimated population as of 2016 is 44,291. Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission. - Nunavut (from Inuktitut: ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949. - Deuterium (symbol ' or ', also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen. The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common hydrogen isotope, protium, has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in of hydrogen. Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.0156% (or on a mass basis 0.0312%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while the most common isotope (hydrogen-1 or protium) accounts for more than 99.98%. The abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to another (see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - Creighton Mine is an underground nickel mine, owned and operated by Vale (formerly known as INCO) in the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It is currently the deepest nickel mine in Canada. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory ( SNO ) was a neutrino observatory located 2100 m underground in INCO 's Creighton Mine in Sudbury , Ontario , Canada . The detector was designed to detect solar neutrinos through their interactions with a large tank of heavy water . The detector was turned on in May 1999 , and was turned off on 28 November 2006 . The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken . The director of the experiment , Art McDonald , was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015 for the experiment 's contribution to the discovery of neutrino oscillation . The underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permament facility and now operates multiple experiments as SNOLAB . The SNO equipment itself is currently being refurbished for use in the SNO + experiment . - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included.

In the initial phrase, there is a lack of explicit detail about the location or direction in which the young women are walking. Simply stating \\"Two young women walking\\" is an incomplete sentence. It is in the form of a subject description, but the predicate, which tells what the subject is doing, is missing. Despite this, it is still clear that the young women's action is that of walking. On the other hand, the conclusion, \\"The two young women are walking somewhere,\\" is a complete sentence. The subject is now \\"The two young women,\\" and the predicate is \\"are walking somewhere.\\" Though still somewhat vague, the sentence now provides slightly more context by explicitly acknowledging that the women are walking towards an unspecified location. The word \\"somewhere\\" indicates movement and destination, even if the details of the destination are not provided. Essentially, while the first statement is a fragmented description, the second statement is a well-structured sentence delivering the same basic idea.

Striker Marquis gave Doncaster a seventh-minute lead when he latched onto a long ball down the middle and rounded David Forde to slot into an empty goal. It was the third home game in a row in which Pompey had fallen behind and Williams cleverly clipped over his shoulder to double the lead.

Congressional Leaders Suggest Earlier Snowden Link to Russia WASHINGTON — The heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees suggested on Sunday that Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, might have been working for Russian spy services while he was employed at an agency facility in Hawaii last year and before he disclosed hundreds of thousands of classified government documents. The lawmakers, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, offered no specific evidence that Mr. Snowden had cooperated with Moscow. Since Mr. Snowden’s disclosure first became public last spring, there has been much speculation that he was collaborating with a foreign spy service. Nearly a year later, however, there has been no public indication that the F.B.I.’s investigation of Mr. Snowden’s actions, bolstered by separate “damage assessment” investigations at the N.S.A. and the Pentagon, has uncovered evidence that Mr. Snowden received help from a foreign intelligence service. A senior F.B.I. official said on Sunday that it was still the bureau’s conclusion that Mr. Snowden acted alone. The questions raised by Mr. Rogers and Ms. Feinstein came as the F.B.I. continues its investigation of Mr. Snowden, and as the debate rages about whether he was a traitor, a whistle-blower or a violator of his oaths who nonetheless started what President Obama again last week called an important debate. To some, he is all three. The initial portrayals of Mr. Snowden depicted a young man shocked by the scope of government surveillance and determined to expose it. In his insistence that he would release only documents showing what he viewed as government wrongdoing or overreach by intelligence agencies, he appeared to be cultivating an image as a whistle-blower. The main recipients of his materials, including The Washington Post and The Guardian, have said that Mr. Snowden insisted that material revealing operations, but no wrongdoing, should not appear in public. But Mr. Rogers described a very different view of Mr. Snowden, as a man who, from the beginning, might have knowingly or unknowingly been directed by a foreign intelligence service. He said the mass of military data in the Snowden trove clearly had nothing to do with privacy or the reach of intelligence services, and he suggested that Mr. Snowden’s possession of a “go bag” to get out of Hawaii, and his smooth entry into Hong Kong, indicated preplanning beyond his individual capacity. Intelligence officials say they have no doubt that Chinese and Russian intelligence have obtained whatever information Mr. Snowden was carrying with him digitally. They also say it is possible that much of the data Mr. Snowden took is stored in an Internet cloud service. Mr. Snowden has said he did not turn over any documents to any foreign governments; American officials say that given the cyber skills of the Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies, they assume that those countries could have gotten them without Mr. Snowden’s knowledge. Mr. Obama weighed in on the subject in a newly released interview with David Remnick of The New Yorker. He insisted Mr. Snowden had not revealed any illegalities, and though he might have raised “legitimate policy questions” the question was, “Is the only way to do that by giving some 29-year-old free rein to basically dump a mountain of information, much of which is definitely legal, definitely necessary for national security, and should properly be classified?” Mr. Obama insisted that “the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.” But he did not say what that way was, and even his own aides acknowledge that if Mr. Snowden had not made so much information public, it was doubtful that the president would have announced the reforms and further studies of N.S.A. actions that he spoke about on Friday. On Sunday, Mr. Rogers appeared to hinge many of his suspicions about Mr. Snowden on a recent Defense Intelligence Agency report that he has described in other interviews as concluding that Mr. Snowden stole about 1.7 million intelligence files that concern vital operations of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force. He said that it would cost billions of dollars to change operations because of the security breaches. The defense intelligence report remains classified, though some members of Congress have been briefed on it in recent weeks. “I don’t think it was a gee-whiz luck event that he ended up in Moscow under the handling of the F.S.B.,” Mr. Rogers said on the NBC program “Meet the Press,” referring to the Federal Security Service, the Russian state security organization that succeeded the K.G.B. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who advises Mr. Snowden, said in a telephone interview on Sunday that Mr. Rogers’s statement was “not only false, it is silly.” Mr. Wizner said that Mr. Snowden’s actions before seeking asylum in Russia were not consistent with someone who was working for a foreign government, pointing out that Mr. Snowden flew to Hong Kong, where he gave classified documents to American journalists. He then sought to travel to Ecuador, and was marooned for five weeks in the transit zone of Moscow’s international airport while he sought asylum in some 20 countries. Mr. Wizner also criticized Mr. Rogers’ description of the defense agency report as “exaggerated national security claims.” American suspicions had been raised in part, according to one official familiar with the intelligence, because intelligence agencies believe that some of the information apparently stored with an Internet cloud service has been changed or moved in recent months. It is not clear how much American intelligence agencies know about where all the trove of data is now stored. The United States is concerned that Russian agents may have access to the data while Mr. Snowden is in the country under temporary asylum, or in exchange for his asylum. Ms. Feinstein, when asked by David Gregory, the host of “Meet the Press,” whether she agreed with Mr. Rogers that Mr. Snowden might have had help from the Russians, was more tentative: “He may well have. We don’t know at this stage.” Both lawmakers said their committees would continue their investigations. Mr. Snowden has been living in Russia since June; in August the authorities there granted him temporary asylum. The Russian government has refused to extradite Mr. Snowden, who has been charged with espionage and stealing government property, to the United States.

The groups say they're angry that the proposed deal raises spending levels in 2014, albeit slightly—to 1.012 trillion from the 967 billion that would have been in place had the full sequester cuts taken effect. The full House votes on the measure tomorrow, and Boehner's language suggests he's not worried about the vote failing, even if a conservative bloc defects. Said Ryan: \\"We feel very good at where we are with our members.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"John Boehner, former Speaker of the House, criticized political advocacy groups, particularly those on the right such as the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity, and Heritage Action, accusing them of using House members and the American public for their own goals. Boehner's \\"uncharacteristically forceful\\" language indicated his frustration with these groups, which have slammed the new budget deal even before it was officially announced. Boehner addressed House Republicans behind closed doors, suggesting that these conservative groups were more focused on raising money rather than defending and promoting conservative principles. The advocacy groups have expressed their anger over the proposed budget deal, which would raise spending levels in 2014 to 1.012 trillion, up from the 967 billion that would have been in place if the full sequester cuts had taken effect. The full House was expected to vote on the measure the following day, and Boehner's strong language implied that he was not concerned about the vote failing even in the event of a conservative bloc defecting. This situation highlights the tensions that exist between the Republican Party establishment, represented by figures like Boehner, and the more extreme conservative advocacy groups, who are seeking to exert influence on the political landscape. The public criticism from Boehner underscores the challenges the GOP faces in managing disparate factions within its ranks, particularly as it tries to negotiate critical legislation like the budget deal. In this context, it is worth noting that the budget deal at the center of the conflict was developed by Paul Ryan, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, who expressed confidence in the proposal's chances in the House vote. Ryan's support for the deal, coupled with Boehner's public criticism of conservative groups, might be seen as an indication of the Republican establishment attempting to reassert its control and direct the party's legislative priorities more effectively. Overall, Boehner's criticisms of conservative advocacy groups are not just a momentary outburst but rather a reflection of the broader struggles within the Republican Party between the establishment and more ideologically driven elements. The outcome of the budget vote and the ongoing tensions between these factions may have significant implications for the GOP's direction and goals moving forward."},{"prompt":"Q:The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.

Summarize the following: Most uncut gems are oddly shaped so you may need to grind it down. Roughly grinding the outsides of the gem will make it closer to the size and shape you want. Hold the gem between your fingertips and carefully polish it on a 1200 grit lap. If you have a lot of rough to remove, use a 260 grit lap. Since faceting machines are expensive and not usually available for rent, see if you can take a few faceting classes to become familiar with using them. If you want to buy one, find one directly from a manufacturer or look online. Heat a dime-sized amount of dop wax on the end of your dop stick. Hold it near a flame so the wax softens and becomes pliable. Stick the base of the gem that will be mounted into the wax. The faced surface of the gem should be exposed. Let the wax cool before you grind it so the gem stays on the dop stick. Once you've gained experience, consider using superglue or cyanoacrylate adhesives instead of wax. These are less likely to break off or damage heat-sensitive gems such as opals. Use a 1200 lap disc on your faceting machine to cut the circumference (girdle) of the gem. Set the angle to 90 degrees so you can make symmetrical cuts. Don't lock the index wheel on the machine so you can move it freely and have more control over cutting. The outline you cut will depend on which shape you've chosen. For example, you'll make a rectangular girdle for an emerald cut. Consult the machine's instruction manual for specific instructions about each style of cut. Wipe the gem clean with a microfiber cloth. This will remove the coarser grit that's transferred to the gem. Take the coarser lap disc off of the machine and put a pre-polishing lap on the machine. Find faceting diagrams for the shape you're cutting the gem. A diagram will tell you how many facets to make and at what angles to make them. Polish the facets against the lap until the surfaces of the gem are smooth. To get the cut you want, you may have to reheat the dop wax, remove the rough, and reposition it in the hot wax. Heating the stone along with the wax will not harm it. Put a polishing lap on your machine. Take the small spatula that came with your oxide polish and dip it into the polish so a peanut-sized amount is on the end of the spatula. Run the machine and spread the polish over the lap in a smooth even layer. This will buff your new gemstone until it sparkles and will help remove any grit or imperfections leftover by the faceting process. To remove the finished stone from the dop stick, warm the wax near an open flame so it softens. Then pull the stone away from the wax.","completion":"Gems are special rocks that can be shiny and pretty. Sometimes, they look weird and need to be shaped.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. I am facing a new situation today: John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the number of mesopredators would decrease, case A or case B? A:","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, the number of mesopredators would decrease in case A. In case A, when the Siberian tiger has a stable population during the sixteenth century, it serves as the apex predator in the Siberian ecosystem. Apex predators, like the Siberian tiger, help control the population of mesopredators by preying on them and restricting their numbers. This regulation is vital to maintaining balance in the ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of mesopredators, and promoting biodiversity. In case B, the introduction of guns in the seventeenth century led to a decrease in the Siberian tiger population. As a result, the removal or reduction of the apex predator, in this case, the Siberian tiger, can lead to mesopredator release. Mesopredator release occurs when the population of mesopredators increases due to the absence or reduction of the controlling apex predator. This increase can cause disruptions to the ecosystem and lead to negative consequences like loss of biodiversity and destabilization of the food chain. Thus, the number of mesopredators would decrease in case A, when the Siberian tiger population is stable and serving its role as an apex predator in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain? ? At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. Astley & Bedford Mosses, along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, is also a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation, known as... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain, specifically Chat Moss, can be categorized into the following: 1. Lowland raised bog: Chat Moss is primarily a lowland raised bog, which forms when there is poor drainage, leading to water-logging and slow plant decomposition. This results in the production of peat, which raises the level of the bog above the surrounding land. The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. 2. Peatlands: The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles and has peat deposits varying in depth between 24 feet and 30 feet. Due to its historical significance and ecological importance, these peatlands form one of the major habitats in the area. 3. Agricultural land: By the 1990s, an estimated 72% of the bog had been reclaimed, with most of it being used for agriculture. This reclaimed land serves as a major habitat in the Chat Moss region. 4. Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI): A 228-acre area of Chat Moss, known as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. This area is protected for its unique flora and fauna, making it another important habitat in the region. 5. Special Area of Conservation (SAC): Along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, Astley & Bedford Mosses form a part of the European Union designated Special Area of Conservation. This area is specifically protected for its ecological significance and supports various unique and endangered species, making it an essential habitat in the Chat Moss region. In summary, the major habitats in the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain, specifically Chat Moss, are lowland raised bogs, peatlands, agricultural land, Site of Special Scientific Interest, and Special Area of Conservation. These habitats support a diverse range of flora and fauna, making the area ecologically significant and important for conservation efforts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Giants' first loss of the year came in this much-anticipated \\"clash of unbeatens\\" against a 4-0 New Orleans team. Manning's first NFL game in his hometown of New Orleans was also Saints tight end Jeremy Shockey's first game against his former team. The Giants' defense, which entered the game as the best in the NFL, gave up 493 total yards and 7 touchdowns to seven different Saints, including Shockey. Scoring touchdowns for the Giants were: Bradshaw, on a 10-yard run in the second quarter; Manningham, who caught a 15-yard pass later in the quarter; and Nicks, whose 37-yard reception from Carr earned him his first career 100-yard receiving game.

Here is a premise: \\"Many small groups enjoy a fireworks show at night.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"People are watching a movie at a drive-in theater.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise provided is: \\"Many small groups enjoy a fireworks show at night.\\" This statement describes a scenario where numerous groups of people are gathered and enjoying a fireworks display at nighttime. It gives us information about people's activities and the nature of the event they are attending, which is a fireworks show. The hypothesis presented is: \\"People are watching a movie at a drive-in theater.\\" This statement suggests a situation where individuals are watching a movie in an outdoor venue, specifically at a drive-in theater, with cars parked and screens set up for movie projection. In order to determine if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true, we need to analyze both statements and see if there is any direct or indirect connection between the two situations. First, let's consider the nature of the events described in both statements. A fireworks show is an outdoor event characterized by explosions of color and light in the sky, usually accompanied by loud sounds and patterns created by pyrotechnics. A drive-in theater, on the other hand, is an open-air venue where movies are played on large outdoor screens for an audience who watch from their parked vehicles. While both types of events happen outside and are predominantly enjoyed during the night, the key differences between these events lie in their content and structure. A fireworks show primarily focuses on the visual and auditory spectacle of the detonations, whereas a drive-in theater is a venue where people watch movies, which consist of a more extended and intricate narrative experience. The premise does not provide any information that directly ties the fireworks show with people watching a movie at a drive-in theater. It only mentions that there are many small groups enjoying the fireworks event. This lack of direct information or connection between the two situations does not allow us to adequately conclude whether the hypothesis is true. Therefore, based on the analysis of the premise and hypothesis, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is true, as the premise does not give us sufficient information or evidence related to the hypothesis. They remain as two separate independent situations, and without additional context or information connecting the fireworks show to the drive-in theater or the people involved, we cannot make an informed judgment about the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: The frozen food is starting to melt, where would I put it? A. supermarket B. refrigerator C. fridge D. grocery store E. heater The best answer is A:","completion":"C. fridge The best answer to the question \\"The frozen food is starting to melt, where would I put it?\\" is C. fridge. This is because a fridge, also known as a refrigerator, is a home appliance that is designed specifically to store and preserve food by keeping it at a cold temperature. The term \\"fridge\\" is simply a shorter, colloquial version of \\"refrigerator,\\" so these two terms can be used interchangeably. While a refrigerator is designed to store food between temperatures of 35-40°F (2-4°C), there is usually a designated freezer section inside the fridge. This freezer section maintains a temperature at or below the freezing point of water (32°F or 0°C), which is essential for preventing the frozen food from melting. By placing the melting frozen food into the freezer section of your fridge, you can ensure that the food will be preserved in its frozen state. This, in turn, will help maintain the quality, taste, and nutritional value of the food, as well as prevent spoilage and the growth of harmful bacteria. Although supermarkets and grocery stores (options A and D) do contain refrigerators and freezers for storing perishable items, they are generally meant for the store's inventory and not for personal use. Plus, these options are not as convenient as storing the food in your own fridge, as you would have to transport the melting food to the store and request permission to store it there, which may not be granted. Option E, a heater, is not an appropriate place to store melting frozen food, as this will only hasten the melting process and contribute to spoilage. A heater is designed to increase the temperature of a room for comfort, not to store or preserve food. In summary, the best answer is C. fridge, as it provides a suitable environment for maintaining the frozen state of your food and preventing it from melting."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

That means it's important for you to set limits with yourself. You also need to express those limits with doctors, nurses, and other caregivers, so they're aware of when you will and when you won't be there. In a time when things seem out of control, you may neglect to focus on good eating habits. You may not eat much, or you may end up eating junk food. Both of those put a strain on you. Try to eat as healthy as you can, even if you have to order food in sometimes or rely on simple meals like salads. Remember to include lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and veggies in your diet. Sleep can also be difficult when you're caring for a loved one. You may be too worried to sleep at times, or the task of caregiving may interrupt your sleep. However, try to get as much as you can, aiming for a regular 7 to 9 hours a day, even if you have to do it in smaller chunks. Not getting enough sleep can put a strain on your health, plus it will make you less effective as a caregiver. Exercising will also help you maintain your health while you're caring for a loved one. As an added bonus, it can reduce your stress level. However, it can be difficult when you are caregiving, so you'll need to find ways to work it into your schedule. For instance, maybe you can take a short walk a couple of times a day. You could also do yoga at home or try jumping rope. You could also ask someone to come sit with your loved one while you take an hour or so to go exercise. That way, you get a much-needed break, plus the exercise you need. It can be easy to overlook signs of health problems in yourself when you’re caring for someone else. However, if you become sick, you won't be able to help your loved one, so it's best to stay on top of health problems. In fact, the best plan is to maintain your regular doctor's visits and dental checkups to make sure you're in good health.

Options: A. compliments B. understand themselves C. life partner D. second chances E. larger house Answer:","completion":"E. Larger House In line with common sense, when a person has more kids, they typically need a larger house. This is because a growing family requires additional space to accommodate the needs of each family member. A larger house can provide the necessary living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, and storage space to improve the overall quality of life for a family with multiple children. More children means more demand for space, as each child requires their own room to sleep, play, and study. Furthermore, families with more kids also need larger common areas, such as living rooms and dining rooms, where the whole family can gather and spend time together. These spaces must be big enough to provide comfort to everyone and allow them to engage in daily activities without feeling too cramped or crowded. In addition to considering the size of the house itself, families with more kids should also take into account the outdoor space, such as a yard or garden. These areas are important for children to play and explore, as well as providing a place for parents to relax and enjoy time with their family. Having access to outdoor spaces is essential for the overall well-being and development of children. Although the other options provided may also hold some level of importance in the context of a growing family, they do not address the fundamental issue of space that is necessitated by more children.

Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a 20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming \\"I don't have any change!!\\" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change. The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in \\"Fantastic Easter Special\\" two weeks ago. Meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, Randy pulls the trigger. In Evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica, California. The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10 What is the sentiment of this review?

One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 Tone ska revival, they continue to perform with six of the seven members of their classic line-up. Madness achieved most of their success in the early to mid-1980s. Both Madness and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts. Context: The core of the band formed as The North London Invaders in 1976, and included Mike Barson (Monsieur Barso) on keyboards and vocals, Chris Foreman (Chrissy Boy) on guitar and Lee Thompson (Kix) on saxophone and vocals. They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as Chas Smash) on bass guitar. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist Dikron Tulane. This six-piece line-up lasted until part way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's garden. Dikron went on to be an actor under the name Dikran Tulaine. Smyth, who left after an argument with Barson, was replaced by Gavin Rodgers, Barson's girlfriend's brother. McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing. Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing. By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage to one of their favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer. Question: Did anyone else leave or get kicked out of the band? Answer:","completion":"Yes, throughout the history of Madness, several members have left or been asked to leave the band due to various reasons. Early in the band's formation, Cathal Smyth (Chas Smash) left the group after a disagreement with Mike Barson. However, he later rejoined the band as a backing vocalist and dancer in 1979. Graham McPherson (Suggs) was also briefly kicked out of the band for prioritizing watching Chelsea football matches over attending rehearsals, but he was later allowed to return. Additionally, the drummer and bass positions in the band also underwent changes. John Hasler, the original drummer, left and was replaced by temporary vocalist Daniel Woodgate (Woody), who ultimately took over the position on drums. The original bass player, Gavin Rodgers, was replaced by Mark Bedford (Bedders). More recently, in 2014, Chas Smash announced that he had left the band to pursue a solo career, leaving the group as a six-piece band. While band members have left or been asked to leave at different points in Madness's history, the group has continued to thrive and adapt, maintaining a core membership and a strong presence in the London ska scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge... Guess a valid title for it!

Movie plot title: Silver Saddle Movie plot: The film opens in a small South Texas bordertown in the 1850s. A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before. The murder is arraigned to take place in a graveyard outside town where Barrett is expected to arrive. Blood lies in wait until a carriage eventually... Answer:","completion":"The farmer confronts Fletcher because he had been cheated by the wealthy land baron Richard Barrett, Fletcher's employer. The farmer claims that Barrett sold him a deed to non-existent property, which prompts the confrontation with Fletcher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Sunni extremists running roughshod across Iraq could produce 'a thousand' global terrorists like Osama bin Laden bent on widespread death and destruction, Iraq's ambassador to the United States warned on Monday. Lukman Faily said that if the United States and other nations focus too much on Iraq's internal politics and ignore the 'immediate threat' of a terrorist movement that's gathering steam, the results will be catastrophic. 'This is a global tumor in Iraq taking place now and in Syria,' he said, referring to the Sunni militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 'We've seen it before.' The White House has scolded Nouri al-Maliki's government in Baghdad for provoking ISIS by alienating the country's Sunni minority. Barack Obama said on Friday that U.S. military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from Maliki's Shia majority. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. Lukman Faily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, warned CNN's Christiane Amanpour that 'a thousand' Osama bin Ladens could emerge from among the Sunni extremists pushing to take over Baghdad. Pushing back: Iraqi Shiite tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities; Iraq's US ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' Bin Ladens from turning the globe into a terrorist shooting gallery. 'Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and account for the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities,' Obama said in public remarks. 'So this should be a wake-up call. Iraq’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.' But Faily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Obama is naively fiddling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all \\"nice to have\\" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Iraq now, to -- is an immediate threat.' 'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, 'that practically half the country feels disenfranchised? The Sunnis?' 'We're not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. 'We want to have that discussion. But we're saying conditioning that discussion is not wise. Making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question.' 'Let me give you an example. What you have in Afghanistan, with one Bin Laden – you will have a thousand of them.' 'No POWs,' he warned. 'Nothing, none of that. No rules of engagement but destruction.' 'That's the situation in Iraq.' Obama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan. They will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Obama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. An administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Iraq, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of ISIS. Obama is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper ISIS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing ISIS off the battlefield now that neighboring Iran has sent 2,000 of its elite Quds forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for Iran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Iraq. Amanpour pushed back against Faily, arguing that the more 'immediate threat' to Iraq was political inequality enforced by Shiites against Sunnis. ISIS aims to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state that transcends national borders -- in areas of Syria and Iraq, and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries. 'A thousand of them': Faily says the late Osama bin Laden (pictured), who masterminded al-Qaeda's 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning is ISIS is allowed to press forward. Obama is stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to keep a U.S.-friendly government in place in Baghdad while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further leveraged Iran at a time when that Islamic republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. Faily said Monday that whether or not the White House decides on a path of limited cooperation with Tehran, Iraq needs help urgently. 'We have been saying that we need to strengthen our army with having fighter planes, Apache helicopters and others. ... The administration now understands that urgency.' he said. They have been willing to say, \\"We are willing to help.\\" What we are saying is we cannot wait until tomorrow. A decision has to be made. It should have been made yesterday. 'From our perspective,' Faily said, 'the urgency of the ground are giving us less options and more radical options.'

Answer the following question: when was sergeant pepper released in the us?","completion":"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the iconic album by the legendary British rock band The Beatles, was released in the United States on June 2, 1967. The album had been released one day earlier, on June 1, 1967 in the United Kingdom. It was the band's eighth studio album and represented a major shift in their musical style, as they transitioned from the traditional pop-rock sound of their earlier work to a more experimental, avant-garde, and psychedelic approach. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is often referred to as one of the first concept albums, as it introduced alter ego band personas and featured a loose narrative theme connecting the songs. The album cover, designed by Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, is also notable for its colorful and iconic collage of famous figures, which has become one of the most recognizable and parodied images in rock history. The album was a critical and commercial success, earning widespread acclaim and topping the charts in several countries, including the US and the UK. Many of the songs on the album, such as \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" and \\"A Day in the Life,\\" have become enduring hits and highlights of the band's career. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is considered a major milestone not just for The Beatles but for popular music as a whole, as it helped to redefine the role of the album as an artistic statement and pushed the boundaries of what could be accomplished within the realm of recorded music. In the decades since its release, the album has continued to be praised and celebrated as one of the most important and influential records in the history of rock music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the process after the hot water has passed through the ground coffee is the collection of the prepared coffee drink. Specifically, this is how it happens: The heated water that passes through the grounds gets saturated with the flavours of the coffee. As a result of this process, what used to be mere water has now been transformed into a hot, aromatic coffee brew. This brew does not stay in the filter with the grounds. Instead, it drips down due to gravity. It falls drop by drop from the filter basket into an area of the coffee machine called the 'coffee pot' or 'carafe,' which is typically made from glass or thermal material to accommodate the hot temperature. The carafe is usually strategically positioned just beneath the filter basket so that it collects all the brewed coffee conveniently. Some coffee machines come with a feature known as a 'brew-pause' function. This temporarily stops the flow of coffee into the carafe for those who can't wait to have their cup even before the brewing cycle is completed completely. Once all the heated water has seeped through the coffee grounds and collected into the carafe as brewed coffee, this marks the end of the brewing cycle. From here, you can then pour yourself a cup of the freshly brewed coffee straight from the carafe. This serves as the climax of this process. However, it is crucial not to leave the brewed coffee sitting on the coffee machine's burner for too long as it could overheat and spoil the coffee's taste. You might also need to turn off the coffee machine, depending on its type and features to ensure safety after the coffee is made. In essence, the last step in the process of making coffee using a coffee machine is the collection of the brewed coffee into the carafe and then serving it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works. Sabrina falls in love with him, even though she quotes others as calling Linus \\"the world's only living heart donor\\" and someone who \\"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\\" In the process, Linus also falls in love with her.

Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” According to the above context, answer the following question. The author probably believes that what would probably help prevent burnout?

Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \\"flows,\\" that objects \\"move through,\\" or that is a \\"container\\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events.

Passage:Born the son of Colonel Arthur Hare Vincent and Elizabeth Rose Manson and educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Vincent was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 24 July 1891. He was promoted to lieutenant on 24 July 1894 and to captain on 13 February 1900. He served with the China Expeditionary Force in late 1900 and then in the Second Boer War in South Africa. Following the end of the war, Vincent left Point Natal for India on the SS Ionian in October 1902 with other officers and men of the J Battery Royal Horse Artillery, and after arrival in Bombay, was stationed in Meerut, Bengal Presidency.

They were self-published, at the cost of 400 by Ben's parents. Over the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a \\"published author.\\" The mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player. But others see self-publishing as a lost opportunity to teach children about hardship and perseverance.

It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels. Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.30.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.38.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop... - Newborn screening is a public health program of screening in infants shortly after birth for a list of conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period. Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician. - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life. - Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 23% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic cases account for 3050% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013. - Jean H.

Usage: The passage is about a situation where Larijani, presumably a political figure, has asked the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany in early November to resume nuclear negotiations. The European Union requires that Iran implements a resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before resuming the talks. There's also mention of how the United States accuses Iran of secretively developing nuclear weapons, which Iran denies as politically motivated. Understanding the content and context of the passage is crucial for generating relevant questions. Part #2: Identifying a temporal relation. Usage: The temporal relation present in the passage is between Larijani forwarding a letter in early November for resuming bilateral nuclear negotiations and the EU insisting that the IAEA resolution must be implemented by Iran before the reopening of nuclear talks. The temporal relation 'before' signifies a sequential order of events- one event happening before another. Part #3: Generating a question about an event. Usage: An instance of this part of the task could be the question: \\"What event did the European Union insist must occur before the reopening of nuclear talks after Larijani forwarded a letter to the European trio's foreign Ministers?\\" It meets the criteria as it clearly targets the event of the EU insisting on the implementation of the IAEA resolution, and the timing aspect or temporal relation of it happening 'before' the reopening of nuclear talks. Part #4: Avoiding yes/no questions. Usage: The provided question, \\"What event did the European Union insist must occur before the reopening of nuclear talks after Larijani forwarded a letter to the European trio's foreign Ministers?\\", can't be answered with a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\".

Question: Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen is switched with carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect more oxygen enters alveoli. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less oxygen being switched with carbon dioxide in the bloodstream can have an indirect effect on the process of more oxygen entering the alveoli. Step by step analysis: 1. When less oxygen is exchanged with carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, it implies that the oxygen concentration in the blood is reduced and the carbon dioxide concentration is increased. 2. An elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood can cause a decrease in blood pH, making it more acidic. This condition is known as respiratory acidosis. 3. The body, in response to respiratory acidosis, will try to maintain homeostasis by stimulating chemoreceptors that detect changes in blood pH. 4. As a result, these chemoreceptors send signals to the brain to increase the respiratory rate. An increased respiratory rate means that the diaphragm and other muscles will contract more frequently, pushing more air out of the lungs and subsequently drawing more air into the lungs. 5. With increased airflow into the lungs, more oxygen will enter the alveoli. This increase in oxygen supply may help alleviate the initial problem of reduced oxygen exchange in the bloodstream. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of less oxygen being exchanged with carbon dioxide indirectly affects the process of more oxygen entering the alveoli through the body's regulatory mechanisms attempting to restore homeostasis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Do you have any questions?","completion":"and directed at provocative and alluring women who led respectable men to destruction), has been applied to a variety of literary characters from many periods and genres. The femme fatale is often seen as a figure of sexual liberation and agency in a repressive society, which Madame White Snake embodies in a certain sense. Her transgressive behavior and eventual punishment can be seen as both a warning against sexual temptation and societal disobedience and an expression of desire for freedom and autonomy. In \\"The Lust of the White Serpent,\\" we see Madame White Snake as a more passionate and even predatory figure, actively pursuing a man and using her supernatural abilities to lure him into a lascivious relationship. While her actions seem to lead to disaster and punishment, they also highlight her power and the possibility of breaking free from societal norms and expectations. In \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda,\\" Madame White Snake is portrayed as a more nuanced and sympathetic character, willing to do everything for her husband and child, even as her true nature is revealed. This depiction allows readers to see her as both a loving wife and mother and a dangerous supernatural figure, all while recognizing her dual nature and the impossibility of her continued existence in human society. The enduring popularity and influence of these stories and the figure of Madame White Snake in East Asian literature and culture are rooted in her transgressive behavior and the societal strictures she represents and defies. As a supernatural being, she brings excitement, danger, and the taboo into the domestic sphere, turning ordinary life into something extraordinary. As a passionate and ambitious figure who defies societal expectations, the character of Madame White Snake becomes both a cautionary tale and an expression of fascination with beauty, power, and danger, and the limits of human and supernatural connection. The moral lessons taught in these stories may revolve around the risks of indulging in forbidden desires, but the true pleasure and interest in these tales lie in the excitement and appeal of transgression, and the opportunity to explore worlds beyond conventional boundaries. Modern retellings and adaptations of these stories, whether in literature, film, or television, have continued to engage with the themes of seductive power, transgressive behavior, and the challenges of attempting to reconcile the supernatural with the human world. In this way, Madame White Snake remains an enduring and captivating East Asian femme fatale and continues to capture the imagination of audiences across generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: In estimating the resources necessary to put new control technology capacity in place (labor, steel, etc.), the Multipollutant and Current Rule Retrofits MWe values of Tables 6-1a, b and c are of greatest interest. Hypothesis: You can estimate the resources you need to do a new control technology capacity. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. To elaborate further, let us first understand the key terms and components of the given premise and hypothesis to provide a more detailed response. 1. Multipollutant and Current Rule Retrofits MWe: These terms refer to the megawatt electric (MWe) capacity of power plants that would be subjected to the retrofit process, which involves upgrading and installing new control technology to reduce their emissions and comply with regulatory standards. 2. Tables 6-1a, b, and c: These tables presumably contain data or information about the MWe values of power plants that need to apply the multipollutant and current rule retrofits, including factors like labor, steel, and other materials required for the implementation process. 3. Control technology capacity: This refers to the capacity of a power plant or facility to efficiently control and mitigate emissions, mainly pollutants as per the required environmental standards. 4. Resources: In this context, resources refer to the workforce, raw materials, and other factors necessary to retrofit power plants and install control technology systems. Now, let's examine the premise and hypothesis: Premise: Essentially, the premise states that to determine the resources required to install new control technology capacity, we should focus on the MWe values given in Tables 6-1a, b, and c. This is because these tables contain the key data regarding the power plants' retrofit capacity, which directly impacts the magnitude of resources required. Hypothesis: According to the hypothesis, it is possible to estimate the resources needed for the installation of new control technology capacity in power plants. When we analyze the premise, it suggests that Tables 6-1a, b, and c contain the most relevant data needed to estimate the required resources for installing new control technology capacity. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as it supports the idea that it is possible to estimate the resources needed for such an installation based on the information provided in these tables. By considering the MWe values from the tables, along with other factors such as the type of control technology, regulatory requirements, and existing infrastructure, one can estimate the necessary labor, steel, and other materials required to effectively implement new control technology capacity in power plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"However, unemployment is at 32 percent, and the average black income is one-sixth the average white one.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Despite this age, America still remains racist and unjust.\\" Step 2: Evaluate whether the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise provides statistics on unemployment and income disparities between black and white Americans. This information showcases an economic disparity between the two racial groups. Step 3: Consider if the premise necessarily entails the hypothesis. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to assess whether the given economic disparities alone can conclusively prove that America still remains racist and unjust. It is important to consider other possible explanations for these disparities, such as historical factors, educational opportunities, and regional economic differences, among others. Step 4: Conclusion While the premise highlights a significant economic disparity between black and white Americans, it does not necessarily entail that America still remains racist and unjust in its entirety. Additional evidence, context, and factors would need to be considered to substantiate the claim made in the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable.

I am planning to go back to India. I am ashamed to be asking for money again. What should I do? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, the two questions don't have the same meaning. They are different in nature but still interconnected since they are both related to going back to India. The first question asks about the changes in India between 2010 and 2015, while the second question seeks advice on handling a personal issue related to finances and returning to India. Here, I will provide answers for both questions. 1. Differences between India in 2010 and 2015: Economic Growth: In 2010, India was still recovering from the global economic crisis. During this period, India's growth rate was around 8.8%, whereas in 2015, the growth rate was approximately 7.4%. The economy has faced some ups and downs, but overall, there has been economic growth and development between these years. Government & Policies: The Indian government changed significantly in 2014 when Narendra Modi, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won the general elections. His government has brought several policy changes like Goods and Service Tax (GST), financial inclusion initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), and schemes like Make in India aimed at making India a global manufacturing hub. Technology and Digitalization: During this period, India experienced rapid digitalization with increased access to the internet, smartphones, and e-commerce. In 2015, the government launched the ambitious 'Digital India' initiative to improve the nation's digital infrastructure and promote digital literacy. Urbanization and Infrastructure: Between 2010 and 2015, the pace of urbanization increased with rising migration to cities. Consequently, the demand for better infrastructure led to the development and expansion of metro rail systems, highways, and airports in various cities across the country. Social Issues: There have been continuous efforts to address social issues such as poverty, gender inequality, and education. Additionally, initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan aimed at improving the cleanliness and hygiene of the country were introduced. 2. Advice for managing finances and returning to India: Develop a Plan: First, create a plan for your return, considering factors like your living arrangements, job prospects, and reintegration into society. Save Money Before Leaving: It's essential to save as much money as possible before returning to India to avoid financial issues. Set aside part of your income for savings and control your expenses. Look for Job Opportunities in India: Utilize online resources and your professional network to look for job opportunities in India. Target industries or sectors that align with your skillset and experience, which will increase your chances of getting a job quickly. Consider Freelancing or Remote Work: If finding a job in India may take time, consider freelancing or remote work, as they offer flexibility and a potential income source while searching for a full-time job. Reach Out to Family and Friends: Talk to your family and friends about your situation. It's essential to have a support system in place when going through difficult times. They might offer temporary financial assistance or help you in finding job opportunities. In conclusion, while the two questions don't have the same meaning, they are related in their concerns of returning to India. It's essential to be aware of the changes that occurred in India between 2010 and 2015 to make the best decision for your reintegration. Furthermore, managing your finances and seeking job opportunities will help ensure a smoother return to India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

McDaniels, who police said is the suspected gunman, is also charged with possession of a firearm by a felon. Authorities said he has four prior felony convictions, three for drug offenses and the fourth for felony evading between 2004 and 2009.

The premise is a direct quote from Jamie Hamon, the executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, saying, \\"This is a major funding crisis for legal aid throughout the state.\\" This statement clearly communicates that Jamie Hamon believes there is indeed a major funding crisis for legal aid in the state. Furthermore, the premise also provides context about Jamie Hamon's position and affiliation with the Access to Justice Foundation, a statewide poverty-law resource center in Lexington, which further validates the perspective. Jamie Hamon is in a position of authority and possesses the relevant knowledge to make an informed statement about the funding situation of legal aid throughout the state. To further emphasize the point, let's break the premise down to analyze its components: 1. Jamie Hamon's statement: The quote from Jamie Hamon is the most important part of the premise, as it is a direct quote reflecting their belief about the state of legal aid funding. 2. Jamie Hamon's position: As the executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, Jamie Hamon's role involves overseeing the organization and addressing statewide issues related to poverty and law. This indicates that they are knowledgeable about the topic and that their statement should be seen as highly credible. 3. The Access to Justice Foundation: The premise specifies that the Access to Justice Foundation is a \\"statewide poverty-law resource center in Lexington,\\" which implies that the scope of the foundation covers the entire state. This further supports the validity of Jamie Hamon's statement, as it reflects their awareness of the funding crisis for legal aid services on a larger scale. It is crucial to understand not only what the statement says, but also the position and context behind it. In this case, the belief expressed by Jamie Hamon is in direct contradiction with the hypothesis in question.

The Pope last night backed military action in Iraq to stop the bloody persecution of thousands of Christians by Islamist fanatics. In a dramatic intervention, Pope Francis said military force could be justified against the murderous extremists of Islamic State in order to counter their ‘unjust aggression’. He also revealed he is considering making an extraordinary visit to northern Iraq to show solidarity with Christians who are being murdered, raped and driven from their homes by the terrorists who have seized control of large swathes of Iraq. Pope Francis has stated military intervention in Iraq is justified to prevent extremists' 'unjust aggression' His intervention came at the end of another day of fast-moving developments in which:. Church leaders have criticised the slow response of the West to the persecution of Christians in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East. But the Pope last night went much further, giving conditional backing to the use of military force to halt the march of Islamic State. Speaking to journalists while returning from a trip to South Korea, Pope Francis indicated he would prefer military action to be backed by the United Nations. Asked if he approved of the unilateral American action on militants he said: ‘In these cases, where there is an unjust aggression, I can only say that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor. ‘I underscore the verb “stop”. I’m not saying “bomb” or “make war”, just stop. And the means that can be used to stop them must be evaluated.’ He has also claimed he could take a trip to northern Iraq himself to show solidarity with persecuted Christians. A Peshmerga fighter pictured in battle with Islamic State forces 20km east of Mosul, Iraq. Kurdish forces driving near the town of Makhmur, south of Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. The Pope also said he and his advisers were considering whether he might go to northern Iraq himself to show solidarity with persecuted Christians. His comments represent a remarkable about-turn for the Vatican, which has vehemently opposed any military intervention in recent years. Only last year Pope Francis staged a global prayer and fast for peace when the West was threatening air strikes against Syria. But the ferocity of the attacks against Christians in recent weeks has raised the issue of whether intervention in Iraq could be considered a ‘just war’. Mr Cameron yesterday risked charges of complacency after quietly departing for a second summer holiday. The Prime Minister insisted he would remain in charge of Britain’s response to the Iraq crisis during a week-long break to Cornwall. Mr Cameron said he would remain ‘within a few feet’ of his BlackBerry mobile phone even while on the beach. ‘I always make sure there are senior ministers on duty in Westminster,’ he said after delivering a speech in central London. ‘But I don’t hand over the Government to a deputy. Wherever I am, wherever I am in the world, I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry and an ability to manage things should they need to be managed. ‘For the next few days I shall not be terribly far away, so if that’s necessary you will find me at my desk.’ Cameron has been criticised for going on holiday while the atrocities and humanitarian crisis in Iraq intensifies. David Cameron and his wife Samantha at a market on the southwestern coast of Portugal earlier this month. But Labour MP Ann Clwyd, Britain’s former special envoy to Iraq, said it was extraordinary that Mr Cameron was pressing ahead with his holiday at a time of crisis. She told the Daily Mail: ‘The Prime Minister should not be going on holiday at such a volatile time. He’s been sounding off, saying Islamic State is a threat to the West. He is right to do that but it just not acceptable to then push off on holiday.’ Miss Clwyd said Parliament should be recalled to debate the crisis. She said she would back some form of military intervention, including the rescue of an estimated 3,000 women and girls of the Yazidi sect captured by fanatics. Some Tory MPs also added to pressure for a recall of Parliament. Conor Burns said: ‘Parliament should be recalled ... so MPs can debate what is going on in Iraq, and we are very naive if we think that what is unfolding on the streets of Iraq has nothing to do with us.’ Earlier, Mr Cameron insisted the Government has a ‘fully worked through’ strategy to deal with the threat of Islamic State, including police action to tackle supporters in this country. He said Britain was ‘not going to get involved in another war in Iraq’. ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground,’ he said. ‘Yes, we should use all the assets that we have – our diplomacy, our political relationships, our aid, the military prowess, the expertise that we have to help others ... to put pressure on Islamic State and make sure ... it cannot cause mayhem on our own streets.’ Number 10 said a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’ unless the situation changes.

For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.

Paragraph: Unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches enable comprehensive pathogen detection in the clinical microbiology laboratory and have numerous applications for public health surveillance, outbreak investigation, and the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, practical deployment of the technology is hindered by the bioinformatics challenge of analyzing results accurately and in a clinically relevant timeframe. Here we describe SURPI (''sequence-based ultrarapid pathogen identification''), a computational pipeline for pathogen identification from complex metagenomic NGS data generated from clinical samples, and demonstrate use of the pipeline in the analysis of 237 clinical samples comprising more than 1.1 billion sequences. Deployable on both cloud-based and standalone servers, SURPI leverages two state-of-the-art aligners for accelerated analyses, SNAP and RAPSearch, which are as accurate as existing bioinformatics tools but orders of magnitude faster in performance. In fast mode, SURPI detects viruses and bacteria by scanning data sets of 7-500 million reads in 11 min to 5 h, while in comprehensive mode, all known microorganisms are identified, followed by de novo assembly and protein homology searches for divergent viruses in 50 min to 16 h. SURPI has also directly contributed to real-time microbial diagnosis in acutely ill patients, underscoring its potential key role in the development of unbiased NGS-based clinical assays in infectious diseases that demand rapid turnaround times.

In other words, I need to return the list A up until the last 5 elements. Here's how I approached the problem: 1. First, I identified the integer i (5 in this case) and the list A (['6417', '9103', 'R', 'q', '3761', '7509', '6579', 'H', '9275', 'n', '7277', '5541', '11', '321', 'b']). 2. I then counted the number of elements in the list A, which has 15 elements. 3. According to the definition, I need to exclude the last i elements of A, which means I need to find the last 5 elements of A. 4. Since A has 15 elements and I want to exclude the last 5 elements, I can simply take the first 15 - 5 = 10 elements of A. 5. I then created a new list that includes the first 10 elements of A. In this case, the list would be ['6417', '9103', 'R', 'q', '3761', '7509', '6579', 'H', '9275', 'n'] 6. Finally, I returned this new list as the answer to the problem, which is ['6417', '9103', 'R', 'q', '3761', '7509', '6579', 'H', '9275', 'n'].

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy. But I can use this background: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. What is an answer for this question: Which camera would have higher beam quality? A:","completion":"Based on the provided background information, we can determine that the camera with a smaller aperture, or Camera A, would likely have higher beam quality. In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on various factors such as focal length, diameter and quality of the input beam, and wavelength. A smaller aperture, like the pinhole in Camera A, will generally lead to better beam quality due to less light being allowed into the camera, resulting in a smaller amount of aberrations. This is because a smaller hole will allow only the most collimated light rays to pass through, thus reducing distortions and improving the beam quality. However, this comes at the cost of reduced power or brightness of the light entering the camera, which might affect the overall exposure and illumination of the photograph. On the other hand, a larger aperture, like the one in Camera B, will let in more light and may enhance some aspects of the image, such as lower noise levels and better performance in low-light situations. However, with the increased light entering the camera, there is a higher likelihood of optical aberrations which may adversely affect the beam quality by allowing uncollimated light rays to enter the camera. In conclusion, Camera A with the smaller pinhole aperture will likely exhibit higher beam quality due to the reduced amount of light allowed to pass through and lower chances of optical aberrations. However, it is essential to consider how the aperture size may affect the overall photographic outcome, as well as other factors such as lens quality, lens focal length, and how these decisions may impact the images that David will be capturing for his photography class."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho).

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the process is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let's analyze each step of the process to better understand how a smaller body size might affect the oxygen reaching the body. 1. Air is taken through the mouth: A smaller body size does not impact this step directly. However, smaller bodies may have smaller airways, affecting the volume of air inhaled during each breath. This reduced volume of air can decrease the amount of oxygen reaching the lungs. 2. Enters the lungs: A smaller body size may result in smaller lungs, which can limit the surface area available for gas exchange. Fewer oxygen molecules can be exchanged in the lungs, leading to a possible decrease in oxygen reaching the body. 3. The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs: In a smaller body, the size of the alveoli (the sacs in your lungs) might be unchanged. However, the total number of alveoli may be reduced due to the smaller overall lung size. This reduction in the number of alveoli can decrease the capacity for oxygen absorption. 4. Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled: A smaller body size may also impact this step indirectly. Smaller lungs may have a reduced capacity for expelling carbon dioxide efficiently. This can lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which, in turn, may impede oxygen transport. 5. The oxygen is passed throughout your body: A smaller body size means less overall tissue and cells that require oxygen. However, with the possible decrease in oxygen absorption and transport due to the factors mentioned in the previous steps, the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues may still be affected. In conclusion, a smaller body size typically indirectly impacts multiple steps in the process. This could initially lead to reduced oxygen absorption and subsequently affect the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. The key factor is that smaller bodies have less overall surface area available for gas exchange, which could result in less oxygen reaching the cells and tissues throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next, let's move the 42 over to the other side to make it easier. We do that by subtracting 42 from both sides: 0 - 42 = -7 * w + 42 - 42 -42 = -7 * w Now, we want to find out what \\"w\\" is! To do that, we have to divide both sides by -7: -42 / -7 = (-7 * w) / -7 6 = w So, w equals 6! We did it! Yay!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are some concepts: ray, reflect, sunlight, water What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"The concept of a ray can be easily connected to the natural phenomena of sunlight and reflection, particularly when interacting with a medium such as water, which further highlights the underlying scientific principles in our everyday experiences. A ray, in the context of physics and optics, is an abstract and idealized representation of the propagation of light or electromagnetic radiation through space, depicted as a straight line traveling in a particular direction. Rays are used to model and analyze the behavior of light as it traverses different media and encounters various surfaces or boundaries. Sunlight, as most of us are familiar with, refers to the radiant energy emitted by the sun that reaches the earth as visible and invisible light waves, providing warmth and illumination in our daily lives. The solar spectrum includes a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to visible light and infrared (IR), which play a significant role in various natural processes such as photosynthesis, weather phenomena, and the sustenance of life itself. Reflection, on the other hand, is a fundamental optical process that occurs when light waves encounter a surface or boundary separating two different media. Depending on the angle of incidence and the properties of the materials involved, a portion of the incoming light (called the incident light) may bounce back into the same medium, giving rise to the phenomenon known as reflection. This process is responsible for the formation of images in mirrors, for instance, where light rays from an object are reflected by the mirror's surface before reaching our eyes. Water, a ubiquitous and essential substance on our planet, not only serves as a life-sustaining medium for living organisms but also possesses unique optical properties that enable various light-based phenomena to occur. When sunlight interacts with water, several things happen: some of the light rays may be reflected off the water's surface, while others may be refracted or bent as they enter or exit the liquid medium. As a result, a complex dance of light takes place, giving rise to diverse optical effects such as sparkling reflections, shimmering patterns, and rainbow formations, depending on the specific conditions and viewing angles. Bringing all these concepts together, we can construct a sentence that embodies their essence and interconnectedness: \\"As sunlight reaches the surface of a serene lake, its rays are reflected and refracted by the water, producing a breathtaking spectacle of shimmering light dancing across the rippling waves, accompanied by the vivid colors of a rainbow arching over the distant horizon.\\" This sentence showcases the fascinating interplay between sunlight, reflection, and water, offering a glimpse into the marvels of optical phenomena that enrich our natural world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: \\"God of War (series)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Let's denote the volume of water to be removed as x liters. Initially, the total amount of acid in the solution would be 40% of 27 liters: 0.40 * 27 = 10.8 liters (acid content) Once the water is removed, the volume of the resulting solution will be (27 - x) liters. Since we want the acid percentage to be 60%, the amount of acid in the resulting solution should be 60% of (27 - x) liters: 0.60 * (27 - x) = acid content Since the amount of acid doesn't change during the process, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for x: 0.60 * (27 - x) = 10.8 Expanding and solving for x: 16.2 - 0.60x = 10.8 0.60x = 5.4 x = 5.4 / 0.60 x = 9 liters So, the correct answer is: D. 9 liters"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - For the Archdiocese in California , USA , please see Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco ( Latin : Dioecesis Franciscopolitanus ) is in Argentina and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Córdoba . - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity. - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco (Latin: \\"Archdioecesis Sancti Francisci\\"; Spanish: \\"Archidiócesis de San Francisco\\") is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States. It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was canonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. What is the relationship between 'roman catholic diocese of san francisco' and 'diocese of the catholic church'?

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? In our Hello World program, we printed out a string for the user to see, but the interactive part of programs is when the user gets to enter input into the program. We will now extend our program to prompt the user for his or her name and then greet the user by his or her name. In Java, we have some built in libraries that we have access to, but we have to import them. One of these libraries is java.util, which contains the Scanner object that we need to get user input. In order to import the Scanner class, we add the following line to the beginning of our code. import java.util.Scanner; This tells our program that we want to use the Scanner object which exists in the package java.util. If we wanted to have access to every object in the java.util package, we simply write import java.util.*; at the beginning of our code. Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it represents concepts using objects. The Scanner object is an example of an object that has fields and methods. In order to use the Scanner class, we have to create a new Scanner object that we can populate the fields of and use the methods of. To do this, we write: Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in); userInputScanner is the name of the Scanner object that we just instantiated. Note that the name is written in camel case; this is the convention for naming variables in Java. We use the new operator to create a new instance of an object. So, in this instance, we created a new instance of the Scanner object by writing new Scanner(System.in). The Scanner object takes in a parameter that tells the object what to scan. In this case, we put in System.in as a parameter. System.in tells the program to scan the input from the system, which is the input that the user will type into the program. We have to prompt the user for an input so that the user knows when to type something into the console. This can be accomplished with a System.out.print or a System.out.println. System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\"); The Scanner will always be taking in data on what the user is typing in. The following line will ask the Scanner to take what the user has typed in for his or her name and store it in a variable: String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine(); In Java, the convention for using an object's method is objectName.methodName(parameters). In userInputScanner.nextLine(), we are calling our Scanner object by the name we just gave it and then we are calling its method nextLine() which does not take in any parameters. Note that we are storing the next line in another object: the String object. We have named our String object userInputName Now that we have the user's name stored, we can print out a greeting to the user. Remember the System.out.println(\\"Hello World.\\"); that we wrote in the main class? All of the code that we just wrote should go above that line. Now we can modify that line to say: System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\"); The way we chained up \\"Hello \\", the user's name, and \\"!\\" by writing \\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\" is called String concatenation. What's happening here is that we have three strings: \\"Hello \\", userInputName, and \\"!\\". Strings in Java are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed. So when we are concatenating these three strings, we are essentially created a new string that contains the greeting. Then we take this new string and feed it as a parameter to System.out.println. Our code should now look like this: import java.util.Scanner; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\"); String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine(); System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\"); } } Go into command prompt or terminal and run the same commands as we ran for our first iteration of HelloWorld.java. We have to first compile the program: javac HelloWorld.java. Then we can run it: java HelloWorld.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – Two months after police in Salt Lake City, Utah, shot and killed 50-year-old black man Patrick Harmon, the Salt Lake County district attorney determined Wednesday their use of deadly force was justified. Soon after, the police department released body cam footage of the shooting, sparking outrage among many in the community who believe Officer Clinton Fox shot Harmon in the back unnecessarily, CNN reports. Even District Attorney Sim Gill says when he first saw the video he thought, \\"Oh my god, this isn't right,\\" CBS News reports. But after slowing the video down Gill says one could see Harmon pivoting toward the officers. Since Harmon was shot in the side, and since a knife police claim Harmon was holding was found at the scene, Gill determined the officers feared for their safety. Members of Harmon's family say they see things differently, especially after viewing the footage Thursday. They say Harmon, who had been pulled over by the officers after riding his bicycle across six lanes of traffic without a red tail light on Aug. 13, was bipolar and schizophrenic. One of Harmon's nieces, Alisha Shaw, told the Guardian, \\"They just murdered him flat-out.\\" The Salt Lake City Police Department had received praise before the shooting for its implementation of de-escalation training, which had resulted in more than two-and-a-half years without a fatal officer-involved shooting in the city. But, according to a local Black Lives Matter activist, that training failed Patrick Harmon. “That officer disregarded his de-escalation training,” Lex Scott says. “How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?”","completion":"A man named Patrick Harmon was shot by a police officer in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was 50 years old and African-American. The people in charge of the city decided that the police officers were allowed to do this because Patrick made them scared for their safety. They said he was holding a knife and turned towards the officers. Many people in the community are really upset about this, because they think the police officer didn't need to shoot Patrick. When the people in charge first saw the video of the shooting, they thought it was wrong too. But after watching the video more slowly, they decided that it was okay for the police officer to shoot Patrick because he turned towards them. Patrick's family is very sad and angry. They say that he had some problems with his mind, like being bipolar and schizophrenic, which means he might have been acting strange or confused. Patrick's niece, Alisha, says that she thinks the police officer just killed her uncle without a good reason. Before this happened, the Salt Lake City Police Department had been doing a good job at not hurting people when they didn't have to. They had been practicing how to calm situations down without using violence. But some people, like Lex Scott from the Black Lives Matter group, think that the police officer didn't use this special training when he shot Patrick.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components. Now, I have a new situation: John is trying to buy a house. Today, he saw two houses, house A and house B. House A was build in the 1920s. It has lead plumbing pipes and lead based paint. House B was build recently. It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint. Answer this question please: Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","completion":"House A would be more likely to cause brain damage than House B. Reasoning: From the information given, we understand that lead is known to cause brain damage, particularly in small children who are more likely to chew on objects painted with lead-based paint. Furthermore, it's mentioned that House A was built in the 1920s and has lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint, both of which are potential sources of lead exposure. On the other hand, House B, which was built recently, has neither lead-based paint nor lead plumbing pipes. Therefore, occupants of House A are more likely to be exposed to lead, and consequently, have a higher risk of brain damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: With Shipwreck Treasure Easier to Reach, a Duel Is On MIAMI — The Spanish galleon San José was overloaded with 200 passengers and 700 tons of cargo on a summer night in 1631 when it smashed into a rock off the Pacific coast of Panama, spilling silver coins and bars into the Gulf of Panama. More than 400,000 coins and at least 1,417 bars were lost over a 40-mile trail. Four hundred years later, that shipwreck has become one of the latest to land in a legal quagmire over who should have the rights to historic artifacts trapped under the sea. This one involves the United Nations, the United States Department of Homeland Security, the government of Panama and Americans accused of being pirates. At issue is whether private companies should be able to claim and profit from historic treasures. Those questions are of particular interest to businesses in South Florida at a time when technology is making it easier to find and recover sunken loot. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that there are over 1,000 shipwrecks in the Florida Keys alone. In the case of the San José booty, commercial treasure hunters, financed in part by an adventure entrepreneur who runs tours to the Titanic, spent over 2 million and 10 years recovering portions of the treasure, only to see their permits questioned and bounty confiscated. “They called us thieves, looters, plunderers and pirates,” said Dan Porter, a Florida captain who led the expedition to find the San José. “That’s an insult. I hold this work in the highest regard.” But the industry is engaged in a battle with academic marine archaeologists and Unesco, the Paris-based United Nations agency that tries to protect cultural treasures around the world. Critics say buried coins and loot should be studied and preserved in a museum, not sported around an investor’s neck. “Treasure hunters are to maritime archaeologists what astrologers are to astronomers,” said Filipe Castro, a nautical archaeologist at Texas A&M University. The Department of Homeland Security has opened an investigation into the case, and several criminal complaints are pending in Panama. Those actions underscore the perils that often accompany maritime salvage recovery, particularly as nations become increasingly sensitive to the cultural significance of underwater treasures. In the colonial era, Spain sent fleets to the new world to excavate gold and silver from places like Bolivia and Peru, but hurricanes and other mishaps often sent ships and the gold they carried to unreachable depths. Pirates and plunderers have long sought to recover them. As technology to find them has improved in recent decades, many legitimate companies have begun hunting, too, only to find their discoveries challenged in court. Panama was so committed to preventing plundering that in 2003, it became among the first countries to sign a United Nations treaty protecting underwater cultural heritage. But at the same time, Panama’s Ministry of Economy and Finance granted a contract giving salvage rights along its waters to a company called Investigaciones Marinas del Istmo, or IMDI. Investors included a former Panamanian governor; a Mexican-American engineer; Mike McDowell, an Australian adventure entrepreneur; and — for a different IMDI salvage project — Pat Croce, a former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. IMDI spent about 10 years fighting legal challenges. The company prevailed, and, with permits and court verdicts in hand, the subaquatic dig for the San José went on. Panamanian government inspectors supervised the project, and a “world class” conservation lab was built to log and preserve each discovery, the company said. Among other items, divers found gold and diamond jewelry, pottery, and nearly 10,000 silver coins, worth up to 1,000 each. Only one 60-pound silver bar was recovered. Based on the contract, the government got to keep anything it considered historically relevant, plus 35 percent of everything else. Some Panamanian government officials objected to the deal and brought in Unesco, which sent a task force to Panama to review the project. Excavation stopped. Even after the haul was divided and the government received its share, the country’s comptroller noted a number of irregularities in the contract, questioned its validity and requested an investigation into how it had been obtained. “The government stopped us, even though we did everything by the book,” said Alberto Vásquez, an IMDI vice president. This summer, when Mr. Vásquez emerged from a bank in Panama City where he had gone to retrieve some of the company’s share of coins that were stored in a safe deposit box, the government seized 3,000 coins, saying he did not have permission to transport it. In September, Captain Porter, who led an expedition, returned to Florida with his 100 coins, worth about 500 or 600 each. The United States Border Patrol boarded his salvage vessel, searched it with dogs for six hours and confiscated the coins. Citing an open investigation, Nestor J. Yglesias, a spokesman for Homeland Security Investigations, the criminal investigation arm of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to comment. Panamanian government officials requested a list of questions from The New York Times, but did not respond to them, despite repeated requests. Ulrike Guérin, who runs Unesco’s underwater culture program, said it was not up to the United Nations to determine the legality of IMDI’s contract, but she stressed that the agency was pleased to see Panama stepping up to stop treasure hunting. Ms. Guérin said Unesco was trying to stop commercial salvagers around the world because they regularly destroy sites without giving any consideration to historical preservation or environmental damage. The divers take special care to preserve valuables such as coins, but disregard precious pottery if it looks too cracked to sell, she said. “This is a fishy business of treasure hunting,” she said in a telephone interview. “I have not seen any case that was a success and everyone liking it. It ends up in a slaughter, destroying the heritage.” James A. Goold, a lawyer in Washington, often steps in on Spain’s behalf when commercial shipwreck divers try to claim long-lost treasures, including some the government believes were fakes. “These ships are time capsules that are irreplaceable and should be preserved for public benefit for study by cultural authorities and archaeologists,” Mr. Goold said. In October, Mr. Goold sent notice to a Tampa company, Global Marine Exploration, which is looking for ships from a 1715 Spanish fleet lost in a hurricane, warning that Spain has not given up its rights long-lost vessels. In 2009, a leading Tampa treasure-hunting company was ordered to return 17 tons of gold and silver from the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes, which sank off Portugal in 1804. Treasure hunters are hoping for a compromise. “You should look at these more like an airplane crash or car crash,” said James J. Sinclair, a marine archaeologist hired by IMDI to evaluate the finds. “You don’t leave them at the side of the road and preserve them forever.”","completion":"The recovery of treasure from shipwrecks is leading to legal conflict. Spanish galleon, the San José, wrecked off Panama in 1631 resulting in the loss of several million dollars’ worth of silver coins and bars. A legal dispute is now taking place involving the United Nations, the US Department of Homeland Security, the Panamanian government and US entrepreneurs over whether private firms should be able to claim and profit from such treasure. This controversy is particularly significant in areas like South Florida where new technology is making it easier to locate and salvage sunken valuables."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Tai Wo Station is a station on Hong Kong 's East Rail Line .

Given the question: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","completion":"The northern region of Italy has fewer species inhabiting it due to the higher levels of abiotic stress. Abiotic stress refers to the negative impact of non-living factors, such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, or pollution, on the living organisms in a specific environment. In the context of the two distinct regions in Italy, the northern region exposes animals to a greater amount of abiotic stress than the southern region. This heightened level of stress results in a less hospitable environment for living organisms, thus reducing the number of species able to thrive in that area. Additionally, the northern region's harsher conditions make it more difficult for species to adapt and maintain stable populations. Conversely, the southern region of Italy experiences a more moderate climate and fewer abiotic stressors, creating a more welcoming environment for species. As a result, this region tends to have a higher level of biodiversity. When an environment is less stressful, it can support a greater variety of species, as those species are not under constant pressure to survive and can instead focus on reproduction and adaptation to their surroundings. The relationship between abiotic stress and endangered species is essential to understanding how ecosystems function and how human actions can impact biodiversity. An increase in abiotic stress often leads to a decline in species populations, putting them at risk of becoming threatened, endangered, or even extinct. For instance, as the northern region of Italy experiences more abiotic stress, the number of species declines in comparison to the southern region. Consequently, the species in the northern region face a higher risk of becoming endangered or extinct. Beyond the case of Italy, it is crucial to study and address the causes of abiotic stress in ecosystems worldwide. Factors such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution can exacerbate abiotic stressors, resulting in further loss of biodiversity and the destabilization of ecosystems. Conservation efforts must focus on mitigating these stressors and implementing strategies to help species adapt to changing conditions, ultimately preserving and promoting biodiversity across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On one hand, the reviewer suggests that the movie lacks meaningful and memorable aspects: \\"none of this is meaningful or memorable.\\" This phrase conveys a negative sentiment, as it implies that the movie may fail to leave a lasting impression on the audience or contain any significant value. However, the reviewer uses a metaphor to offer a more positive outlook: \\"frosting isn't [meaningful or memorable] either, and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that, would you?\\" By comparing the movie to frosting, the reviewer acknowledges that while it may not be a substantial piece of work, it still has a certain level of appeal or enjoyment. Frosting is typically associated with sweetness and indulgence, suggesting that the movie may be a guilty pleasure or a light, entertaining experience.

But Fury has not forgiven Haye for pulling out of two scheduled fights against him in 2013 and causing him \\"mental and physical torture\\". \\"David Haye will never get a fight against Tyson Fury after what he did to me,\\" said the Manchester boxer. \\"I remember him saying that he'd never give me a payday.

But there were times [when Haye pulled out of the fights] that I didn't want to box any more. \\"He is a pretender, a fraud and he is getting no opportunities from us.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Haye, who lost to Klitschko in 2011, recently announced a comeback. He has not fought since beating Dereck Chisora in 2012 and underwent major shoulder surgery in 2013. The 35-year-old, a former two-weight world champion, will fight Australia's Mark de Mori in London on 16 January. Haye told BBC Sport on Sunday: \\"Tyson Fury is the number one in the division now. Mark de Mori is ranked number 10, I need to work my way up to two, to number one contender, to get to Tyson Fury. \\"If people want to come and support me on this journey to Tyson Fury then feel free, because it's going to be a fun ride.\\" A fight between Fury and Haye appeared to make perfect sense and could fill Wembley Stadium. And as is always the case in boxing, it could still happen, despite Fury's outburst. Fury's first defence is likely to be a rematch against Klitschko. Immediately after their fight the Ukrainian said he would trigger a rematch clause, although there is a chance he will decide that at 39, his best days are behind him. Aside from Haye, another prospective opponent for Fury is American Deontay Wilder, the WBC title-holder. Victory over Wilder would make Fury the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 2000.

Specifically, it mentions that the rule was approved by the Senate. Therefore, to evaluate the truth value of the second sentence, given that the first sentence is true, we need to examine the information provided in both sentences. The first sentence states that the new rule became effective on December 7, 2000. We can assume this is true. Given this information, we know the following: 1. There is a rule. 2. It became effective in the year 2000. 3. The specific date it became effective is December 7, 2000. Now let's examine the second sentence. It states that the rule became effective in 2000 after being approved by the Senate. This sentence provides additional information not found in the first sentence, mainly the approval by the Senate. However, we can still evaluate the parts of this sentence given what we know from the first sentence: 1. The rule we're discussing is the same rule as in the first sentence. 2. It also became effective in the year 2000, which matches the information from the first sentence. From this evaluation, the only part we cannot determine the truth value of is the approval by the Senate statement. However, as both sentences agree on the rule becoming effective in the year 2000, and the main part of the second sentence refers to its approval, it is plausible that the second sentence is true.

Movie title: Airport '77 Context: A privately owned luxury Boeing 747-100, Stevens' Flight 23, flies invited guests to an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens, who also owns the jetliner. Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished.

Q: Sasha threatened everyone in the room with detention if they kept talking. Given the context: How would you describe Sasha? Choices: - irritated - laid back - threatened A:","completion":"In the given context, Sasha could be described as irritated. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that when people are in a position of authority or responsibility, such as an educator or manager, they often need to maintain a certain level of control in order to effectively communicate important information or maintain a conducive environment for learning or work. When their surroundings are noisy or chaotic, this typically interferes with their ability to carry out their tasks effectively, which can lead to feelings of frustration and, ultimately, irritation. In this question, Sasha resorts to threatening everyone in the room with detention if they continue talking. This action implies that they have reached a point where their patience has worn thin, and the noise or disruption must be addressed immediately to restore order. Threatening detention is a means to convey the message that the disturbance caused by the issue at hand is not tolerable, and that strict measures will be taken to quell it. Thus, based on the available information, it is reasonable to infer that Sasha is irritated. The other provided choices – laid back and threatened – are not accurate descriptors of Sasha's behavior in the given context. A laid back individual is typically more casual and relaxed, unlikely to resort to such strict measures as threatening detention, while someone who feels threatened may still be assertive or afraid but is not necessarily irritated by the situation. In conclusion, evaluating the context and understanding Sasha's actions, it becomes evident that the appropriate description for Sasha's state in this situation is \\"irritated.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: \\"Well, the big you know the big vans are all real nice.\\" This sentence is expressing a positive opinion on big vans, stating they are nice. Sentence 2: \\"Big vans are too risky.\\" This sentence expresses a negative opinion on big vans, stating they are risky. Option (a): Yes - If we choose this option, we would be saying that Sentence 2 is also true if Sentence 1 is true. However, Sentence 1 states a positive opinion on big vans while Sentence 2 states a negative opinion, so they don't relate directly in terms of truthfulness. Option (c): No - If we choose this option, we would be saying that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 is false. However, this is not necessarily accurate either because these sentences don't contradict each other directly. Sentence 1 is talking about the niceness of the vans while Sentence 2 is talking about the riskiness, and these traits aren't mutually exclusive. It's possible for big vans to be both nice and risky at the same time. So, our answer is: Option (b): It is not possible to tell - This option fits best since Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 assess different traits of big vans.

Please answer the following question: Information: - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903. - The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either . The earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan 's The Baseball Cyclopedia , published in 1922 . For example , the league 's only \`\` star '' player , Fred Dunlap , led the league in batting average with .412 ( 86 points higher than his second - best season and 120 points higher than his career average ) , on - base percentage , slugging percentage , runs scored , hits , total bases , and home runs ( with just 13 , typical for the era ) . After the league folded , Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than 10 home runs until he retired in 1891 , another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association . Of the 272 players in the Association , 107 ( 39.34 % ) never played in another major league , while 72 ( 26.47 % ) played very briefly ( less than 300 at bats and / or 50 hits ) in other major leagues , and 79 ( 29.04 % ) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues .

The story is both heartbreaking and inspiring, reminding us that even in times of tragedy, we can find hope and courage in the selfless acts of young individuals like Kiera. The Incident: According to Fox 5 San Diego and the San Diego Union-Tribune, Kiera Larsen and several other children were playing in and around a parked Mercedes while Kiera's stepmom was inside their house retrieving a car charger. As they played, the vehicle unexpectedly shifted into neutral and began rolling down the sloping driveway towards Kiera's siblings and friends. Kiera Larsen's Heroic Actions: Kiera demonstrated incredible bravery and quick thinking in a truly terrifying situation. Seeing the car rolling towards the group, she instinctively jumped into action and pushed a 2-year-old girl out of the path of the oncoming vehicle, protecting the young child from potential fatal harm. Tragically, however, Kiera was unable to avoid the vehicle herself and was struck by it. She was transported to a nearby hospital, but she ultimately succumbed to her injuries. Praise and Remembrance: The California Highway Patrol officer who responded to the incident shared candid admiration for Kiera's heroism, stating, \\"A child died heroically...she sacrificed herself for another small child.\\" This sentiment was echoed by Alissa Jenkins, the mother of the 2-year-old Kiera saved, who said, \\"She is truly a hero. She will forever be my kids' guardian angel...she saved both my daughters' lives.\\" Financial Support for Kiera's Family: In the wake of Kiera's untimely passing, a GoFundMe page was set up to help her family cover funeral costs. The overwhelming support the family received resulted in more than 45,000 raised, demonstrating the profound impact Kiera's brave actions had on both her local community and beyond. Investigation and Prevention: As the community mourns the loss of a young hero, authorities are working tirelessly to determine how the parked car, which was off at the time, shifted into neutral and began rolling down the driveway. Understanding the circumstances surrounding this tragic event is vital in preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future. Conclusion: While no words can truly capture the magnitude of Kiera Larsen's heroic actions, her memory will live on through the lives she saved and the hearts she touched. The strength and selflessness she displayed in the face of imminent danger remind us that even the youngest among us can make an incredible impact on the world. Kiera leaves a lasting legacy of heroism, and her story serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer choices: - congestion - anemia - constipation - sweating - hives - energy usage - dehydration - heat energy A:","completion":"Caffeine consumption can cause several side effects, including dehydration. The consumption of caffeine can lead to the following effects: 1. Dehydration: Caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means it increases the production of urine and can lead to dehydration if you don't consume enough water alongside it. 2. Sweating: Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, which can lead to an increase in body temperature and an increase in sweating as the body tries to cool itself down. 3. Energy usage: Caffeine acts as a stimulant, increasing alertness and energy levels in the short term. This effect can lead to increased work capacity and endurance, but it may also result in energy crashes or fatigue later on. 4. Constipation: Caffeine can sometimes cause constipation by slowing down the movement of the gut or by increasing dehydration if not enough water is consumed. 5. Anemia: While caffeine doesn't directly cause anemia, it can interfere with iron absorption. If a person drinks large amounts of caffeine, they might be at a higher risk for anemia if they don't have a balanced diet and proper iron intake. 6. Congestion: Although caffeine can have a decongestant effect in some cases, excessive consumption may lead to symptoms similar to congestion, such as headaches, sinus pressure, or difficulty focusing. 7. Hives: In some cases, hypersensitivity or allergy to caffeine can manifest in symptoms such as hives, itching, or skin rashes. 8. Heat energy: Caffeine increases metabolic rate, which means the body generates more heat energy. This can contribute to sweating and a sense of increased internal temperature. While caffeine is not directly responsible for all of these side effects, excessive consumption or individual reactions might lead to one or more of them. It is essential to consume caffeine in moderation to minimize the risk of these negative outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The cat of Joseph had bad behavior compared to that of Jeffrey because Choose your answer from: (A). Joseph took care of it.; (B). Jeffrey took care of it.;","completion":"(B). Jeffrey took care of it. Joseph always wondered why his cat had a worse attitude than Jeffrey's. Upon closer observation, he finally figured out that it was because Jeffrey took care of it. Jeffrey, being an animal lover, often spent time caring for Joseph's cat when Joseph was not at home. He would feed the cat, play with it, and even clean up after it. It was clear that the cat had grown fond of Jeffrey and behaved better when he was around. In contrast, Joseph had a busy schedule and often neglected his cat. He would forget to feed the cat properly and rarely spent quality time with it. Over time, the cat grew distant and bitter towards Joseph, resulting in its bad behavior. Joseph knew that he needed to address the issue immediately. Here is how he planned to do it: Step 1: Spend more time with the cat. Joseph realized that one major cause of the cat's bad behavior was a lack of attention from him. He decided to set aside at least 30 minutes each day to play with the cat and cater to its needs. Step 2: Improve the cat's living environment. Joseph decided to invest in a more comfortable bed, better quality toys, and a scratching post for his cat. He believed that providing a better environment would improve the cat's mood and, therefore, its behavior. Step 3: Follow a proper feeding routine. Joseph acknowledged that inconsistent feeding was another cause of his cat's frustration. He planned to set specific meal times to ensure that the cat would not be left hungry or overfed. Step 4: Seek professional advice. If the cat's behavior did not improve, Joseph considered consulting with a veterinarian or a pet behaviorist to explore potential underlying issues. Step 5: Monitor the cat's behavior changes. Finally, Joseph decided that he would closely monitor the cat's behavior over the next few months. He would keep a record of any incidents and observe if there were any improvements. By following these steps, Joseph hoped to mend the bond between him and his cat, resulting in better behavior and a happier relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jennifer Hudson and fiancé David Otunga have ended their relationship after 10 years. “They have been in the process of ending their relationship for a number of months,” Hudson’s rep tells PEOPLE exclusively in a statement. “Today, Jennifer requested and received a protective order against her ex-fiancé. Jennifer’s actions are solely taken in the best interest of their son,” the statement concluded. Hudson, 36, and Otunga, 37, are parents to 8-year-old David Daniel Otunga Jr. Otunga’s attorney, Tracy M. Rizzo, released a statement to PEOPLE on behalf of the former pro wrestler following the split news. Kevin Mazur/WireImage “Mr. Otunga has never abused or harassed Ms. Hudson or their son, and it is unfortunate, especially in today’s climate, that she would feel the need to make these false allegations against him. Mr. Otunga looks forward to his day in court and in being awarded the residential care of the parties’ only child,” a part of the statement read. Former pro wrestler Otunga proposed to Hudson in September 2008 after less than a year of dating. The couple welcomed their only child nearly a year later in August 2009. About a month after becoming engaged, Hudson’s mother, Darnell Donerson, and her brother, Jason Hudson, were found fatally shot in a Chicago home. Her 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found dead in the backseat of a car. Hudson’s former brother-in-law William Balfour was convicted of the murders in 2012. ||||| Jennifer Hudson Cops Throw David Otunga out of Family Home After She Gets Order of Protection Jennifer Hudson Gets Order of Protection Claiming David Otunga is Threat to Her and Child EXCLUSIVE Jennifer Hudson had the cops come to her Chicago-area home Thursday night and throw baby daddy David Otunga out ...

Sources tell TMZ the catalyst for the order of protection is turf and custody war. Our sources say the couple has been broken up for several months ... after David allegedly found out Hudson was dating someone else. David stayed in the family home -- which is owned by Jennifer -- partly because he's been the primary caregiver since she's on the road a lot. We're told the couple has been negotiating a custody arrangement for the last few weeks, but the negotiations broke down after both David and Jennifer dug in ... each wanting primary physical custody of their son. Our sources say Jennifer demanded that David leave the home, and when it became apparent he wasn't going to comply she went to court for the order of protection. She's also filed a petition for full physical custody. ||||| Jennifer Hudson may not have her fairytale ending with David Otunga after all. The couple have broken up and ended their relationship after 10 years, E!

However, when it became apparent to Ms. Hudson that Mr. Otunga would be the parent granted residential care of the child, as a result of Mr. Otunga being the child's primary caregiver while Ms. Hudson pursues her career all over the world, Ms. Hudson decided to file a meritless Petition for Order of Protection in an effort to gain an unfair advantage in the custody dispute,\\" Tracy Rizzo explained. \\"As a result of Mr. Otunga's career in the WWE, Ms. Hudson felt that she could give an award winning performance in court to portray herself as the victim. Mr. Otunga has never abused or harassed Ms. Hudson or their son, and it is unfortunate, especially in today's climate, that she would feel the need to make these false allegations against him. Mr. Otunga looks forward to his day in court and in being awarded the residential care of the parties' only child.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Singer and actress Jennifer Hudson and her fiancé, former pro wrestler David Otunga, have ended their 10-year relationship.

Step 1: Analyze the context - The description in the paragraph revolves around the process of waxing someone's legs. The location is not specified, but it can be assumed that the two people are in a place designated for waxing or personal grooming. Step 2: Evaluate the options - Based on the given context, we need to examine each proposed ending to see if it reasonably completes the paragraph. (A). blow dry his legs - It is unlikely that they would blow dry his legs after having just applied wax. This choice does not present a logical conclusion to the process of waxing. (B). rip the wax off his legs one strip at a time - This choice is both logical and relevant. Waxing involves applying wax to a person's body, then quickly removing the wax to pull out hair from the follicles. This ending correctly describes the next step in waxing. (C). put something on his legs and he starts to turn his legs around - This choice does not seem to fit the context of the paragraph or any specific waxing step. It is unclear and does not seem relevant to the process. (D). polish his shoes thoroughly - This choice is irrelevant to the context of the paragraph.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The House on Sorority Row Context: Seven sorority sisters pull a prank on their strict house mother, Mrs. Slater, who is known for carrying a sharp walking cane. Their plan is to put her cane out in their dirty pool and force her at gunpoint to retrieve it. The prank goes awry when Vicki, believing the gun to be loaded with blanks, shoots Slater who collapses and appears to be dead. The girls agree to hide the body in the pool until their graduation party is finished. As the party begins, a guest wanders around the pool and an unidentified figure stabs him through the throat with Slater's cane. When other guests attempt to throw Jeanie in the pool, they are stopped by the sorority sisters. The girls realize that if the pool lights get switched on they will reveal Slater's body, so Stevie goes into the power room to disable them. While doing so, she is brutally stabbed to death by the same cane-wielding figure. Later, the pool lights do come on, but Slater's body is no longer in the pool.

Write a summary based on this article: A zoo in the Egyptian capital Cairo has vehemently denied claims that it tried to pass off donkeys as zebras by painting them black and white. Egyptian student Mahmoud Sarhan exposed the alleged masquerade in a Facebook photo, in which he is seen posing next to one of the offending animals at Cairo’s International Garden park. The beast appears to have unusually large ears as well as suspicious blotches of black on its snout and body, but Sahran wrote in the photo caption that it was the animal’s recognizable braying sound that well and truly gave it away. READ MORE: Miniature donkey triggers police chase in Arkansas Zoo officials denied making an ass of themselves, with the facility’s director telling local radio station Nogoum FM that the animal is in fact a zebra and not a donkey in disguise. However, a veterinarian told news outlet Extranews that he concurred with the disgruntled student, pointing out that real zebras have dark snouts, not striped ones. Follow @Kalvapalle ||||| A zoo has denied painting black stripes on a donkey to make it look like a zebra, following a series of images which appeared online. Mahmoud Sarhan, an Egyptian student, posted pictures of the animal on Facebook after visiting Cairo’s International Garden park. He said the donkey enclosure featured two painted animals. Experts were quick to agree with Mr Sarhan’s assessment. Alex Adams, a wildlife biologist and researcher at Colorado State University, said there was no doubt it was something other than a zebra. “The stripes (on a zebra) are always defined, never smudged, and zebras can be small but never that small,” he told The Independent. “The ears are rounded, not oblong and pointy, and of course zebras have black skin, answering that age-old question of them being black with white stripes.” World news in pictures 51 show all World news in pictures 1/51 26 July 2018 Former cricketer Imran Khan has claimed victory in Pakistan's general election, following the nation's violent day at the polls yesterday.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose anger and frustration over his marriage can be evidenced in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904? While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Please answer this question: when did the nashville predators become a team?","completion":"The Nashville Predators joined the National Hockey League (NHL) as an expansion team in 1998. The journey towards the establishment of the franchise began several years prior to their debut in the NHL. The idea of forming a major league hockey team in Nashville, Tennessee, can be traced back to Craig Leipold, a businessman and passionate hockey fan. In the early 1990s, Nashville was undergoing significant growth and development, which prompted Leipold to envision the potential of bringing professional hockey to the city. In June 1995, Leipold and other investors submitted an application to the NHL to establish a hockey team in Nashville. At the time, the league was already looking to add new teams to reach its expansion goal of 30 franchises by the year 2000. Nashville's thriving economy and the construction of a new arena, later named the Bridgestone Arena, were key factors that supported the bid. On June 25, 1997, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman formally announced that Nashville would be one of the four cities awarded an expansion franchise. This announcement marked the beginning of the Nashville Predators organization. The team's name was selected following a \\"Name the Team\\" contest that drew proposals from thousands of fans. The name \\"Predators\\" was inspired by the remains of a saber-toothed tiger that was found in the city in 1971 while the construction of a skyscraper was underway. The saber-toothed tiger has since become the emblem of the team's logo. The Nashville Predators officially took the ice for the first time on October 10, 1998, in their inaugural regular-season game against the Florida Panthers. The team won their first game on October 13 against the Carolina Hurricanes. The Predators' initial season saw them finish with a record of 28 wins, 47 losses, and 7 ties, which was considered a commendable result for a new expansion team. Since their inception, the Nashville Predators have become a competitive force in the NHL, continually improving their performance and making regular playoff appearances. One of their most notable achievements includes reaching the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Overall, the formation of the Nashville Predators can be attributed to the vision of Craig Leipold, the city's growth and development, and the NHL's expansion plans. The team now enjoys a strong fan base and has contributed greatly to the promotion of hockey in the Southern United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: How Hip-Hop Is Becoming the Oldies Less than a year ago, the Indianapolis radio station WRWM, then known as Indy’s i94, was the 15th-most-popular station in the Central Indiana market. It played a forgettable mix of Maroon 5, Sam Smith and other staples of what in radio lingo is called hot adult contemporary — the sort of stuff that drivers might alight on for a song or two but rarely add to their presets. For the last six months of 2014, among listeners ages 6 and older, the station’s Nielsen ratings hovered around a 2.0 share, meaning roughly 2 percent of radio listeners in the market tuned in. I94’s corporate parent, Cumulus Media — a conglomerate that owns about 460 radio stations in 90 U.S. markets — thought it could do better. Last fall, Davey Morris, a Cumulus program director at one of the company’s branch offices in Providence, R.I., called Jay Michaels, the station program director at i94, to discuss a number of ideas for revamping the floundering station, up to and including a format change. Changing formats is something radio stations avoid as best they can: It’s expensive and, for corporate-owned stations, usually involves extensive market research. If i94 changed, it would be the station’s 10th switch in 21 years. The 93.9 slot in Indianapolis hadn’t enjoyed any real success since it first went live in 1993. That year, it began as Ecstasy (WXTZ), an independently owned easy-listening station. It switched to a solid-gold soul format in 1996, then to smooth jazz the next year. It switched again in 1997, to country, and that year it was acquired by a conglomerate called Susquehanna Radio. Susquehanna moved its country station (104.5 the Bear, WGRL) down the dial to occupy the 93.9 frequency, before switching it to ’80s hits in 2001, and from that to contemporary Christian in 2004. The station became syndicated talk radio in 2006, and later that year Susquehanna was acquired by Cumulus Media. Along the way, there were dalliances with stunt formats and place holders: Christmas music and TV-show themes for days on end; nothing but construction noises at one point; at another, ‘‘The Lonesome Road,’’ by Dean Elliot & His Big Band, and ‘‘Swans Splashdown,’’ by Jean-Jacques Perrey, played on a loop. Late in 2007, Cumulus switched to the somewhat gross call letters WARM, with 93 hours of commercial-free easy listening and soft-rock. In July 2009, after the station finished 21st in the local ratings, it switched to a Top 40 format and changed its name to i94. Two years later, the station became ‘‘Indy’s i94’’ and added older hits to its mix, thereby becoming hot adult contemporary. ‘‘We’d [flipped] so many times, it was really hard to build a fan base,’’ Morris said. ‘‘We were never anybody’s first choice. We were their fourth choice.’’ Morris and Michaels started talking about what Indianapolis radio needed. The market was saturated: Emmis Radio had country, news/talk, soft adult-contemporary stations and sports; iHeartMedia had classic rock, alternative and sports covered; Radio One had a gospel station, plus three contemporary hits stations; Entercom had two of those, plus sports. One of the ideas the two came up with was a variation on a new format: classic hip-hop, pioneered just a month earlier by a Radio One station in Houston called Boom 92.1. By playing hit ’90s rap records, Boom tripled its audience, and Radio One had begun to duplicate the strategy in other markets. The two men brought the idea to Cumulus’s executive vice president of content and programming, John Dickey. Around the same time, Dickey caught word that Radio One was planning to launch a Boom clone in Indianapolis. He was determined to beat them to market. He told Morris to do a ‘‘classic hip-hop holiday weekend,’’ to test listener reaction and stake their claim to the format in Indianapolis. Michaels dropped the needle on Naughty by Nature’s ‘‘Hip Hop Hooray’’ at 3 p.m. on Dec. 19. LL Cool J’s ‘‘Around the Way Girl’’ followed, then ‘‘Move,’’ by Ludacris. ‘‘We set up a voice-mail box for listener feedback,’’ Michaels said. ‘‘I was expecting lots of complaints. We went from playing Maroon 5 to ‘Me So Horny.’ ’’ The phone rang so much they had to clear the mailbox every day. Callers were ecstatic. The station never returned to its old format. In three weeks, 93.9 made the improbable jump from 15th place in Central Indiana to first. Two weeks later, i94 officially became 93.9, the Beat. Ratings for January showed 93.9 with a 7.7 share. It ranked first among people ages 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; women 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; and men 18-49 and 25-54. ‘‘Literally nobody in the Top 50 markets in this country has ever done a format change, then in the next full month shot to No. 1,’’ Tom Taylor, the publisher of a popular radio-industry newsletter, told Indianapolis Business Journal. ‘‘Certainly no station in the last decade has done what [WRWM] has.’’ The Beat stole a huge piece of the listenership of Radio One’s top urban stations in Indianapolis, too: WTLC-FM 106.7, ‘‘Indy’s R & B Leader,’’ dropped to 4.5 in January from a 6.6 in December. WHHH-FM 96.3, Radio One’s mainstream urban station, saw its share plummet to 3.9 in January from 5.1 in December. Meanwhile, the Beat’s advertising rates grew by 150 percent. Ever since the earliest days of rock ’n’ roll, time has corroded yesterday’s musical radicalism into today’s pabulum. Thirty years ago, young listeners of hip-hop, with its predilection for violent imagery and unprintable language, might have thought it impervious to this process. But radio conglomerates are proving them wrong. As its listeners grow up and memories of Tipper Gore grow dim, hip-hop is now taking its final step toward respectability: It now qualifies as oldies. I sat with Jay Michaels one morning this spring while he worked on the Beat’s weekend playlist. His office is tiny, airless and cluttered with Hello Kitty lunchboxes, promotional teddy bears, novelty coffee cups and rubber duckies. On his computer, he had loaded Stratus, Cumulus’s proprietary music-­scheduling software. He pressed a button, and dozens of songs populated a grid on the screen, color-coded in a pattern that Michaels refused to explain. Michaels and Morris are cagey about Stratus, which is used companywide but customized by each station. They refer to the software as their ‘‘secret sauce.’’ What I gleaned through later conversations is that Michaels has broken hip-hop down by region and into subgenres, and the Beat uses these metadata tags to keep its playlist diverse. On Cumulus’s version of the format, you’ll never hear back-to-back-to-back Southern rap hits or a cluster of R & B songs with female vocalists; the Beat will break up a block of tunes by harder artists like Ice Cube or DMX with a Mariah Carey track. ‘‘Without flow, this format is a train wreck,’’ Michaels said as he sifted through the computer’s selections, massaging the playlist. ‘‘It’s me being overly anal. I have my own rules.’’ Among them: Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac should never be played back to back (it might call to mind their deadly feud), and a Biggie song should never be played before or after ‘‘I’ll Be Missing You,’’ the tribute song Puff Daddy recorded after Biggie was killed. Michaels also won’t play Outkast next to Ludacris — it just feels weird. The Beat is just one of several stations experimenting with the format now, and certainly such rules differ in each city. But the basics of the formula are the same that were developed by Radio One in October. That was the month the company unplugged a failing news station in Houston, 92.1 KROI-FM, dismissed all the employees and started playing Beyoncé songs, commercial-free, 24 hours a day. Beyoncé’s fans — the BeyHive — went bonkers. News outlets from all over the country called with questions about the odd format. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the station paused for a commercial and then played ‘‘Mind Playing Tricks on Me’’ by the Geto Boys, arguably Houston’s most famous contribution to rap music. Notorious B.I.G. followed, then Tupac, then Salt-N-Pepa. The early ratings returns were astounding. The station’s audience shot to 802,000 from 245,000, and its Nielsen share went to 3.2 from 1.0. Shortly after that, Radio One started similar stations in Philadelphia and Dallas and saw a gain of 200,000 listeners in each of those cities. Soon, 15 more stations, including 93.9, made the switch. A cynical but not inaccurate way of thinking about radio formats is as a tool to segment the population for advertisers. Ancient and unglamorous as it may be, radio remains a potent vehicle for advertisers to access consumers. According to a 2015 Nielsen Audio Today report, 91 percent of Americans age 12 or older listen to the radio each week, and the vast majority of those listeners are in the work force (which means they have money to spend). According to another Nielsen study, advertisers achieve more than 6 of incremental sales for every 1 spent on the radio. For radio-station owners, the business plan is simple: Attract the broadest possible audience to your programming and then do everything you can to keep them listening. This is why radio professionals talk about musical genres in ways normal human beings do not; no one believes she listens to rhythmic adult contemporary, but in aggregate, millions of people between the ages of 25 and 54 do. The Beat, and stations like it, target listeners in their mid-20s to mid-40s: people who grew up during rap’s golden era. This is a subset of the population that is outgrowing contemporary hip-hop radio (which targets the 18-34 demographic) but is mostly too young to be nostalgic for ’70s and ’80s stations and too hip for adult contemporary. They are also entering the prime spending years of their lives — marriage, children, car buying and homeownership — and radio, like all forms of media, is figuring out how to catch them. In a sense, classic hip-hop is following a radio trend that began in the early 1970s, when the first dedicated FM oldies stations started up in Phoenix, playing records by old crooners and doo-wop quartets. The format was a hit, and it quickly spread to Los Angeles and New York, and everywhere else. Oldies reached its zenith in the 1980s, just as classic rock — a new iteration of the same concept — was born. Same story: The format grew as programmers looked for new ways to keep grown-up baby boomers tuned in. Over the years, people in the radio business have discovered that even these seemingly static formats are quite pliable. Davey Morris told me about B101, a once-venerable oldies station in Providence, R.I. ‘‘When I first started listening, they were playing hits from the ’50s and early ’60s,’’ he said. ‘‘Now they’re playing the Police.’’ The Crests, the Platters and the Chordettes are being shoved aside, saved for Saturday-night specialty shows. At the same time, the leading edge of classic-rock stations continues to slide forward, and many are adding ’90s acts to their rotation: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Green Day and others. ‘‘If classic rock wasn’t careful, it was going to age itself out of the buying demos,’’ Jon Miller, vice president of audience insights at Nielsen, told me. ‘‘It would be left with an aging audience that isn’t appealing to Madison Avenue.’’ One person at the Beat told me that the station’s ideal listener is a woman between 35 and 44 who is a homeowner and her family’s decision maker. As of now, around 50 percent of the Beat’s audience is white, 45 percent is black and 4 percent is Hispanic (just 10 percent of Indianapolis is Hispanic). By contrast, the city’s top contemporary hip-hop station, WHHH, has an audience that is 68 percent black, 6 percent Hispanic and around 25 percent white. With the Beat, Dickey said the station had achieved universal likability. ‘‘The format is multicultural,’’ he said. ‘‘Anybody — black, white or Hispanic — can claim ownership of this music.’’ Though they’re in the odd position of creating something like a canon for rap music, Morris and the other programmers I spoke with made it clear that they don’t see themselves as stewards of the genre. Their job is to play the hits. Morris, in particular, is looking forward to the summer, when he thinks the Beat’s true potential will be realized. ‘‘People are going to drive around with their windows down and this music blasting,’’ he said. ‘‘They’re going to play it at the beach and at parties. It’s going to be like popcorn and bonbons: We’re just going to keep feeding them hits.’’ Today, that’s easier than ever. Using something called a Portable People Meter, which looks like a beeper, Nielsen collects listening data from its survey participants by detecting hidden tones in a station’s audio stream. The meters can tell which station the panelists are listening to, whether they’re at home or away and how long a listener stays on a station. Independent analysts can provide even more granular data than that, allowing radio programmers to gauge which songs people respond well to and which tracks push them to change the station. Nielsen recently analyzed four months’ worth of airplay data at 11 new classic hip-hop stations all over the country (including Boom), from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Bay Area, to determine the Top 50 songs in the format. The songs cover the 13 years from 1991 to 2004, with a pronounced feel-good bent and subtle West Coast bias. The Top 5 are: Luniz, ‘‘I Got 5 on It’’; Ice Cube, ‘‘It Was a Good Day’’; Snoop Doggy Dogg, ‘‘Gin and Juice’’; Notorious B.I.G., ‘‘One More Chance’’; and 50 Cent, ‘‘In Da Club.’’ Tupac’s ‘‘How Do U Want It,’’ ‘‘I Get Around’’ and ‘‘California Love’’ are in the Top 25; his more barbed songs, like ‘‘Brenda’s Got a Baby’’ and ‘‘2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,’’ aren’t even in the Top 50. The Wu-Tang Clan is represented only by Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s crossover hit ‘‘Got Your Money.’’ Somehow, Chingy’s ‘‘Right Thurr’’ has the No. 33 spot. There has always been a tension in hip-hop between those songs that are made for radio play and songs that were made for the real fans. But the classic hip-hop format seems to act like a sieve that catches only the most radio-friendly of the past’s radio-friendly records. Take, for example, ‘‘It Was a Good Day.’’ That song wasn’t even Ice Cube’s biggest hit in 1993, the year it came out; ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ was. But ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ is a song typical of early ’90s Ice Cube — angry and violent, with jokes about S.T.D.s, guns and prison rape — and ‘‘Good Day’’ is downright happy go lucky. In it, Ice Cube eats a halal breakfast; wins at basketball, dice and dominoes; and sees his name written in lights on the Goodyear blimp. In May, I visited WRWM and sat in on its drive-time program. Notorious B.I.G.’s ‘‘Juicy’’ played as we approached the 3 o’clock hour. Manning the boards was Zack Babb, a.k.a. Zakk, who hosts a show, weekdays from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Zakk, who is 27, tall and blond, wore board shorts and canvas sneakers and spent his downtime watching the traffic on Interstate 465 out the window. He watches it stack up every day, he told me. He seemed thrilled by it. There are just three on-air personalities at the Beat, including Zakk, who did just about everything but decide which song came next. While the music played, he recorded and edited the other elements that go into radio: sweepers, bumpers, ramps, promos. In preparation for a prescheduled spin of Mark Morrison’s ‘‘Return of the Mack,’’ Zakk recorded a ramp: ‘‘Remember hearing this one at United Skates of America? Some guys at the rink used to do a cool backward shuffle to this song. Every time I tried it, I fell on my butt.’’ (Roller-skating, he explained to me, was huge in and around Indianapolis in the 1990s.) As hours in the studio glided by, so did the utterly irresistible blend of rap and R & B hits: Outkast’s ‘‘Hey Ya!’’ led to Wreckx-N-Effect’s ‘‘Rump Shaker.’’ Then Keith Sweat’s ‘‘Make You Sweat’’ played into Coolio’s ‘‘Fantastic Voyage.’’ When ‘‘Still Fly,’’ by Big Tymers, came on, Zakk fondly recalled blowing out his dad’s speakers as a kid. Each hour was announced by a new classic hip-hop standard. At 4 p.m., it was Tupac and Dr. Dre’s ‘‘California Love.’’ At 5, as traffic on Interstate 465 slowed, it was Jay Z and UGK’s ‘‘Big Pimpin’.’’ Snoop took us into cocktail hour with ‘‘Gin and Juice’’ at 6. The traffic on the Interstate had halted by then, and I marveled out loud at the symmetry of the scene. We were sitting in a radio station, gazing out at people held prisoner with nothing to do but listen. I asked Zakk to look out the window and tell me the first thing that came to mind. He grinned widely and said, earnestly: ‘‘I imagine all of those people in their cars dancing.’’ A version of this article appears in print on July 19, 2015, on page MM26 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: Back in the Day.

On October 10, 2017, Shannon and Swift revealed the title of their proposed sequel, Friday The 13th: Camp Blood -- The Death of Jason Voorhees. The rights to the franchise are slated to revert to New Line/Warner Bros. in 2018. However, Victor Miller, who wrote the original Friday the 13th screenplay, asserted that Horror Inc. derived its current copyright to the screenplay from Miller's transfer of copyright to Horror Inc.'s predecessor-in-interest, the Manny Company. Miller sent a Notice of Termination to Horror Inc. on January 26, 2016, purportedly reclaiming his rights to the screenplay and the content contained therein through termination of the transfer of rights he had formerly made to the Manny Company. will there be a new friday the 13th?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Problem: Solve -2878*n + 565 = -111677 for n. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -2878*n + 565 = -111677 for n, we will perform several mathematical operations to isolate the variable n. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. Start with the given equation: -2878*n + 565 = -111677 2. Subtract 565 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant on the left side: -2878*n = -111677 - 565 3. Simplify the right side: -2878*n = -112242 4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the n term (-2878) to isolate n: n = -112242 / -2878 5. Simplify the right side: n = 38.96539279869067 The value of n is approximately 38.965. Due to the decimal being a non-terminating decimal, we could round off to a more appropriate number for the context if needed. For example, we could round off to two decimal places (38.97), but for now, we'll leave it as an exact value. Therefore, the answer is: n ≈ 38.965."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what time period is mentioned second? Context: A generation later, the Irish Anglican bishop, George Berkeley (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism. In response to Locke, he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.

Article: There are some great differences between the traditional family and the modern family. The first important difference is in the man's role.The traditional husband was the head of the household because he was the only one who worked outside the home.If the wife worked for money,then the husband was not considered to be a good provider,In many families today,both husband and wife work for money.Therefore,they share the role of head of household.In addition,the traditional husband usually made big decisions about spending money.However,the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife.Also,the traditional husband did not help his wife with housework or meal preparation. Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Article:","completion":"Title: Implementing Proper Citation Techniques: A Guide to Accurate Academic Referencing Author: Smith, Jane Publication Date: March 1, 2022 Publisher: XYZ Publishing, New York, NY Source: The Journal of Academic Writing and Research, Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 321-334 URL: http://www.xyzpublishing.com/journal-articles/proper-citation-techniques Introduction Citations are essential in academic writing, as they acknowledge the intellectual contributions of others and highlight the foundation of one's research. A proper citation increases the credibility of the author and demonstrates scholarly diligence. This article provides a comprehensive guide to citing sources accurately and appropriately in academic work, focusing on key principles such as correctly listing the author's last name, providing publication details, and comprehensively presenting publication data. Listing the Author's Last Name The first step in citing a source is listing the author's last name. This properly attributes credit to the original creator of a specific work. In different citation styles, the author's last name may be followed by the author's first initial, first name, or by a comma or a period. When citing multiple authors, it is crucial to follow the guidelines of the specific style manual and separate each author by commas or semicolons as required. In cases where a work’s authorship is unknown or anonymous, the guidelines of the style manual being used should be followed for proper citation format. Publication Date The publication date is an essential piece of information for academic citations, as it establishes the chronology of the cited work and its place in the progression of knowledge. Dates should always be provided in a clear and consistent manner, according to the style manual being employed. Typically, the year of publication is listed, but some citation styles may require the month or day to be included as well. Title of the Source The title of the source is an essential component of a citation, as it allows readers to locate and identify the work being cited. Titles may vary based on the material being cited, as journal articles, books, and online resources may have varying title requirements. It is crucial to provide the complete title, ensuring that it is accurately and consistently presented according to the guidelines of the chosen citation style. For example, some styles require the title to be italicized while others may require the use of quotation marks. Publisher's Location and Name The publisher’s name and location contribute valuable information that identifies the specific edition, version, or imprint of a cited work. This data helps distinguish between various editions and versions of a work and contextualizes the information within the citation. Adhering to the guidelines of the specific citation style used, the publisher's location and name should be included, typically in the following format: city, state, and/or country, followed by the publisher's name. Publication Titles in Full For periodicals such as journals, newspapers, and magazines, it is crucial to provide the complete title. Abbreviating or truncating titles can lead to confusion and difficulty for readers seeking to locate and consult the source. When citing a periodical, ensure that the title is spelled out completely, and maintain consistency with other sources cited within the same document. Volume, Issue, and Page Numbers Volume, issue, and page numbers are essential elements of citations for periodicals. These details provide precise information on where the cited material can be found within a specific journal or periodical, allowing readers to locate and read the original source for context and accuracy. Be mindful of citation style requirements, as some may require the use of abbreviations for volume and issue, while others do not. URL for Online Publications Finally, for online publications, the citation should include the specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available. This ensures that the reader can access the cited material directly and verifies the legitimacy of the source. URLs should be accurate, up-to-date, and reliable to facilitate ease of access. Conclusion Proper citation techniques are imperative for maintaining the integrity of academic work and respecting the intellectual property of others. By following the guidelines presented in this article, authors can ensure that their citations are accurate, consistent, and adhere to academic conventions, ultimately contributing to an enhanced level of quality and credibility in their research."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. the youth, whether immigrant offspring, young immigrants or refugees experience discrimination as they are met with prejudice and not seen as independent persons. Make this proper case.","completion":"Young individuals, encompassing immigrant offspring, young immigrants, and refugees, frequently encounter discrimination as they face prejudiced attitudes and are frequently not perceived as independent entities deserving of equal opportunities and respect. This compelling issue warrants an in-depth investigation to understand the roots of this discrimination, its repercussions on the targeted youth groups, and the ways in which society can address and rectify this inequity. To comprehend this multifaceted issue, it is crucial to recognize the various factors that contribute to discrimination. The primary cause stems from the perpetuation of stereotypes and stigmatization of immigrant youth and refugees. Often, these young individuals are automatically associated with negative characteristics, such as being a burden on the social and economic systems, potential involvement in crime or terrorism, and being perceived as resistant to integrating into the host culture. Consequently, these assumptions lead society to view them as undesirable or even as threats, rather than seeing them as individuals with their unique experiences and aspirations. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences hinder the smooth integration of immigrant and refugee youth into mainstream society. In many cases, these young individuals may not possess an adequate command of the local language, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and impede access to educational and employment opportunities. Additionally, unfamiliar customs and ways of life can create a lack of understanding or appreciation for their cultural background, further contributing to their marginalization. Moreover, institutional discrimination plays a significant role in perpetuating inequity for immigrant and refugee youth. This may manifest in various forms, including biased law enforcement practices, preferential treatment for native-born youth in educational settings, and limited access to essential services for refugees and children of immigrants. Such systemic disparities often result from implicit biases or deeply entrenched xenophobic attitudes, which can further jeopardize the well-being and future prospects of these young individuals. The consequences of this discrimination are far-reaching and have a profound impact on the targeted youth groups. It can lead to a sense of hopelessness and alienation, adversely affecting their mental and emotional well-being. They may experience difficulties in acclimating to their new environment, developing relationships, and participating in social, educational, and professional pursuits. This, in turn, can impede their ability to flourish and contribute positively to society, potentially wasting valuable talent and resources. In addressing and rectifying this issue, several steps must be taken to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for immigrant and refugee youth. Firstly, raising awareness and fostering understanding through educational programs can help combat stereotypes and challenge prevailing misconceptions about these individuals. Educators, for instance, can incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into their curricula, promoting empathy and broadening students' cultural horizons. Secondly, implementing targeted resources and support systems for affected youth, such as language classes and cultural integration programs, can empower them by equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to prosper in their new society. Encouraging intercultural exchange and dialogue also helps build bridges between native-born and immigrant communities, fostering mutual respect and understanding. Lastly, addressing institutional discrimination is vital to creating meaningful change. This involves evaluating and revising policies that contribute to systemic disparities, as well as holding institutions accountable for their actions and decisions that impact the lives of refugee and immigrant youth. Advocacy groups, community organizations, and local governments must work collaboratively to create policies and initiatives that promote equality and diversity. In conclusion, immigrant offspring, young immigrants, and refugees experience profound discrimination in numerous ways and on multiple levels. By recognizing the causes and consequences of this discrimination, society can take crucial steps towards rectifying this injustice and fostering an environment where these youth are regarded as independent individuals deserving of respect and equal opportunities. Through awareness, education, targeted resources, intercultural dialogue, and policy reform, a truly inclusive society can be achieved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Some relatives of homicide victims want morgue photos as keepsakes It’s unusual, but not unheard of, for medical examiners to provide families with photos of departed kin, although most often it’s done only after the autopsy, the police investigation and court proceedings are complete. Practices differ across the country: As a rule, Maryland does not release photos to relatives or to anyone else; Virginia does, free, under tightly controlled circumstances. Families of D.C. homicide victims aren’t criticizing the District for providing photos of the faces of the deceased. Some embrace the chance to have what they consider an important keepsake, even one that might make others cringe. It might be the only way to come to terms with the death. Or it might help fill an agonizing void for parents unable to witness their child’s last breath or even see the body at the funeral home. “I want to see my baby,” said JoAnn Lee, who pulled out a morgue photo as she talked with a reporter about her daughter, Candance Reed, who was stabbed to death in November outside a bar in Northwest Washington. Lee, a 66-year-old Ohio resident, carries the photo with her in an envelope. Tinamarie Spencer rushed to a hospital after her son Robert was shot in the chest in September, but staff workers denied her access to the 21-year-old’s body. She identified him from a photo at the D.C. medical examiner’s office that shows just his face, his lips taut. His mother says it shows that her son died smiling. “Myself, and my son’s godmother needed that for reassurance that my son was at peace,” Spencer said after buying two photos. Beverly Fields, a spokeswoman for the D.C. medical examiner’s office, said that photos are available to families and that the fee covers administrative and processing costs. The money goes into the city’s general treasury. The District morgue relies on photos to make identifications. Relatives, she said, are “not able to see the body in person, so many do want a photo. That’s the closest thing they have.” Officials were unable to say how many photos have been requested and sold. The medical examiner lists the prices — 10 for glossy or laser prints, 15 for 35mm slides — on the same fee schedule that lists charges of 150 for “body storage” and 75 for a report explaining a stillbirth. The District is poised to get a new chief medical examiner, Roger Mitchell, currently an assistant state medical examiner in New Jersey. “We don’t provide photos to family members,” a spokesman there said. He declined to say what Mitchell’s policy might be once he arrives in the District, possibly in February. He said Mitchell would not consent to an interview until after the appointment is confirmed in Washington. People mourn in different ways, some privately, others with public memorials such as flowers left on a tree at the scene of a car crash or a portrait on a T-shirt. Many compare a morgue photo to an open coffin at a funeral home, although in the latter the decedent is presented in a more peaceful way. Gregory G. Davis, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said there is no one accepted practice. In Jefferson County, Ala, where he is the chief coroner, he said relatives sometimes request the photo used to identify the body. “We decline,” Davis said. But, he said, relatives who want photos can get them once the autopsy report and police investigation are complete. The request has to come from an attorney, and all the photos are sent to the attorney, who can decide how to distribute them. “This is the last photo taken of the person, and people want to see it,” Davis said. “I know what’s involved in an autopsy, and I don’t want to see my wife or my children or my parents that way. But others clearly think differently.” In Los Angeles County, a coroner who runs a gift shop called Skeletons in the Closet, which raises money for a program to prevent drunken driving and sells beach blankets with chalk outlines of bodies, says his office would not sell photos of the dead to be used as family relics. “You can buy towels but no photos,” said Ed Winter, the assistant chief. Upon request and at no charge, New York authorities provide photos used for identification to relatives. Virginia also gives photos to the next of kin. But Maribeth Brewster, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Health, said a pathologist sits down with the relative to review the images — which can be brutally clinical and gruesome — to explain what was done and why. In Maryland, the public can review autopsy reports but not photos. Spokesman Bruce Goldfarb said that only on rare occasions will officials bend the rules. Unlike in other states, Maryland’s medical examiner’s office does not handle identifications, leaving that task to law enforcement. Goldfarb said an exception was made for a woman who “was really in denial and could not believe her son had died.” She was allowed to see a photograph but not take it home. “We encourage people to do viewing at funeral homes, where there are family members and grief counselors,” he said. Julia Dunkins, who runs a District support group called Survivors of Homicide, said she believes that only a fraction of relatives want postmortem images of loved ones. She said some might not have other photos of the person. “They didn’t get a chance to talk to them. This last photo is all they have to remember them by,” she said. Dunkins’s then-28-year-old husband, John Baxter, was shot and killed in Northeast Washington in 1969, and her 24-year-old son, Jonathan Baxter — born the year his father was killed — was shot to death in Northwest Washington in 1993. She identified both at the medical examiner’s office. Survivors now look at photos in which a shroud covers everything below the neck. Just the face is visible, and death is unmistakable. “I don’t want a picture like that,” Dunkins said.

A: A:","completion":"Mitosis and meiosis are both processes of cell division, with dramatically different products and functions within an organism. Mitosis refers to the type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is crucial in the growth, repair, and general maintenance of the body. It occurs in somatic cells, which are all cells in the body except the sex cells. Mitosis is divided into several phases, including interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. Each phase plays a crucial role in ensuring that the genetic information is accurately copied and distributed to the daughter cells. On the other hand, meiosis is a form of cell division that results in four non-identical daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is vital for sexual reproduction, as it creates gametes (sperm and egg cells) in animals and spores in plants. Gametes produced through meiosis are haploid, meaning they carry a single set of chromosomes, while somatic cells are diploid, carrying two sets of chromosomes. Meiosis ensures genetic diversity among offspring, as the chromosomes from each parent are recombined to create a unique genetic mix. Meiosis is a two-step process, which includes meiosis I and meiosis II. Both of these stages further consist of several phases. Meiosis I involves prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis, and genetic material may be exchanged between them through crossing over. This exchange increases genetic diversity in the offspring. Then, the homologous chromosomes line up and separate during metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I, resulting in two daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosome pairs. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis in terms of the phases involved, but instead of producing identical daughter cells, four non-identical haploid gametes are produced. The stages of meiosis II include prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II, and cytokinesis. The process notably lacks any further DNA replication and ensures that the gametes produced will have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. In summary, mitosis and meiosis are two distinct types of cell division, each with different products and purposes within an organism. While mitosis results in two identical daughter cells for growth, repair, and maintenance, meiosis generates four non-identical gametes with half the number of chromosomes for sexual reproduction and genetic diversity. Understanding these processes is vital to understanding the life cycle and reproduction of living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Although Sarkozy is from the same party as Chirac and hopes to receive an endorsement from him, the President has not yet expressed his support for a particular candidate to succeed him, and he did not refer to Sarkozy during any moment of his speech.

Artis Leon Ivey Jr. (born August 1, 1963), known professionally as Coolio, is an American rapper, actor, chef, and record producer. Coolio achieved mainstream success in the mid-to-late 1990s with his albums It Takes a Thief (1994), Gangsta's Paradise (1995), and My Soul (1997). He is best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit single \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\", as well as other singles \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" (1994), \\"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)\\" (1996) and \\"C U In 1995, Coolio made a song featuring R&B singer LV for the movie Dangerous Minds, titled \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\". It would become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the #1 single of 1995 for all genres, and was a global hit, as it reached #1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that parody artist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\", titled \\"Amish Paradise\\". At the 1996 Grammy Awards, the song won Coolio a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. Originally \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio's studio albums, but its success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track sampled the chorus and music of the song \\"Pastime Paradise\\" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly 20 years earlier on Stevie Wonder's album Songs in the Key of Life. The album Gangsta's Paradise was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album contained two other major hits in \\"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)\\" and \\"Too Hot\\" with J.T. Taylor of Kool & the Gang doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album Curb Servin', on the song \\"In a Twist\\". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song \\"It's All the Way Live (Now)\\" from the soundtrack to the movie Eddie. He was also featured on the song \\"Hit 'em High\\" from the soundtrack to the movie Space Jam with B-Real, Method Man, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes. In 2014, the band Falling in Reverse did a cover of \\"Gangster's Paradise\\" for \\"Punk Goes 90's\\", with Coolio making a cameo in the music video.

The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Valide Sultan ruled by exercising significant influence and power within the Imperial Harem and the Ottoman court.

Results: \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\" is a Victorian epic poem about the Arthurian knight Sir Tristram and his lover Iseult, written by Algernon Charles Swinburne. 2. Research on William Morris: I need to conduct a search on William Morris to learn about his works, influences, and connections in the literary world. Results: William Morris was a dominant figure in the British Arts and Crafts Movement. As a poet and author, his works were profoundly influenced by medieval themes. 3. Cross-reference \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\" with William Morris: Once I have information on both the poem and Morris, I compare the two to identify any potential connections or relationships.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the lead single from the 10th album of the band that were content to work without deadlines? Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year.

By Mike Dickson Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM On a morning that felt more like Paris in winter than in the springtime, Heather Watson further confirmed that she is back to her best form by reaching the second round of the French Open. The 22 year-old Channel Islander scored her ninth consecutive victory by outpointing world number 66 Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova 6-3, 6-4 in 95 minutes to earn herself a big test against the tournament’s fourth seed Simona Halep of Romania. Watson also guaranteed herself the tidy sum of £35,000 for winning a round, having already done the hard work of coming through the qualifying event. In tough conditions the British number two, fast closing on the injured Laura Robson, again showcased the attacking mindset she has adopted in climbing back up the rankings this year.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who escapes through an underground tunnel? from the following article ? One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children. The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by Müller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the Bürgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, Müller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \\"the Circus of Night\\".

Unitas and Helen Superfisky, who both were of Lithuanian descent; he grew up in the Mount Washington neighborhood. When Johnny was five years old, his father died of cardiovascular renal disease complicated by pneumonia, leaving the young boy to be raised by his mother, who worked two jobs to support the family. His surname was a result of a phonetic transliteration of a common Lithuanian last name Jonaitis. Attending St. Justin's High School in Pittsburgh, Unitas played halfback and quarterback. The 1964 season would see the Colts return to the top of the Western Conference. After dropping their season opener to the Minnesota Vikings, the Colts ran off 10 straight victories to finish with a 12-2 record. The season was one of Unitas' best as he finished with 2,824 yards passing, a league-best 9.26 yards per pass attempt, 19 touchdown passes and only 6 interceptions. He was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the AP and UPI for a second time. However, the season would end on a disappointing note for the Colts as they were upset by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, losing 27-0. Unitas resumed his torrid passing in 1965, as he threw for 2,530 yards, 23 touchdowns and finished with a league-high and career best 97.1 passer rating. But he was lost for the balance of the season due to a knee injury in a week 12 loss to the Bears. More postseason heartbreak would follow in 1965. The Colts and Packers finished in a tie for first place in the Western Conference and a one-game playoff was played in Green Bay to decide who would be the conference representative in the 1965 NFL Championship Game. The Colts lost in overtime 13-10 due in large part to a game-tying field goal by Don Chandler that many say was incorrectly ruled good. Backup quarterback Gary Cuozzo also suffered a season-ending injury the following week and it would be running back Tom Matte who filled in as the emergency QB for the regular-season finale and the playoff loss to the Packers. Unitas, healthy once more, threw for 2748 yards and 22 touchdowns in 1966 in a return to Pro Bowl form. However, he posted a league-high 24 interceptions.

The 26-member International Energy Agency said, Friday, that member countries would release oil to help relieve the U.S. fuel crisis caused by Hurricane Katrina. Can we draw the following conclusion? The United States has asked member states of the International Energy Agency to provide oil.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be reasonably inferred that the United States may have requested assistance from International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries to help address the fuel crisis caused by Hurricane Katrina. The IEA committing to release oil supplies in response suggests a likelihood that the request came from the United States. It is important to understand the role of the International Energy Agency in such situations. The IEA was established in 1974 as an autonomous intergovernmental organization in response to the 1973-74 oil crisis. Its primary objective is to coordinate the energy policies of its member countries, particularly to ensure energy security and manage global oil supplies in case of need. The 26-member organization's membership is composed of major oil-consuming countries, including the United States, to stabilize markets and coordinate collective action during energy crises. When natural disasters or emergencies affect a country's ability to meet its energy needs, the IEA may intervene by utilizing its authority to coordinate the release of emergency oil stocks. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, the implications were severe as the US Gulf Coast is a major hub for oil production and refining. The hurricane led to a significant reduction in domestic oil production capacity and had a considerable impact on fuel availability in the United States. Considering the circumstances and the purpose of the IEA, it is reasonable to conclude that the United States likely asked for assistance from other member countries. The international collaboration and commitment to helping the US during this crisis can be seen as an example of the IEA's role in maintaining global energy security and supporting its member nations during challenging times. It is also worth mentioning that the gravity of the situation, the anticipated impact on the fuel markets and the potential for price spikes could have prompted the IEA to take such steps, even in the absence of a formal request. The IEA may also act preemptively to mitigate the risks and consequences tied to oil supply disruptions. However, in this specific scenario, it seems plausible that the United States sought support from the IEA and other member countries to alleviate the fuel crisis arising from Hurricane Katrina."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write the next sentence.","completion":"Surprised and exhilarated by his success, Rex felt a surge of confidence and nostalgia wash over him as the realization dawned that his body still retained the muscle memory from his gymnastic days – thus reigniting his passion to pursue the sport once more and inspiring him to reconnect with the athleticism that had laid dormant within him for so long. Together with his friend, they decided to embark on a journey towards rediscovering and reclaiming their lost talents, starting with regular practice sessions at a nearby gymnasium and seeking guidance from their former coaches and mentors. Over time, Rex regained his strength, flexibility, and dexterity as he committed himself to a consistent training routine, finding that the once-distant memory of his gymnast past began merging seamlessly with his present self. Word spread about Rex's incredible journey back into the sport, attracting the attention of local newspapers and sports enthusiasts alike. It wasn't long before he earned a reputation for overcoming adversity and challenging the limitations that life had seemingly placed upon him. Aside from rekindling his passion for gymnastics, Rex's story also served as a source of inspiration for others who had long given up on their athletic dreams and ambitions. His persistence and dedication to growth acted as a testament to the power of perseverance and the notion that it's never too late to reawaken one's inner potential. Rex's return to gymnastics was not without its challenges; he encountered moments of doubt and faced the physical and mental limitations of his older body. However, the encouragement and unwavering support of his friend and the larger gymnastics community served as a constant reminder that he was never alone in his endeavors and this became his guiding force to defy the odds and recapture his former glory. Years passed and Rex's skills continued to improve, gaining momentum with each small victory and personal best. He dabbled in various disciplines of gymnastics and found immense satisfaction in helping aspiring young gymnasts develop their own abilities, passing on the knowledge and techniques that had been integral to his own comeback story. Soon, his greatest joy became rooted not only in his accomplishments but also in fostering the progress of those around him, knowing that he was contributing to a legacy that extended beyond himself. As Rex stood on the beach one day decades later, the memory of that seemingly simple cartwheel remained etched in his mind. He was now a respected mentor, coaching the next generation of gymnasts and ensuring that the passion for this unique and awe-inspiring sport would continue to flourish. With his friend by his side, Rex's story of tenacity and personal growth would continue to inspire generations of athletes to dare to dream and never view any obstacle as insurmountable.

They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot.

Context: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night. Bruce Kugler Question: after the incident, how long will it take Bruce to forget about this?

He was the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI (r. 14921503) and his long-term mistress Vannozza dei Cattanei. He was the brother of Lucrezia Borgia; Giovanni Borgia (Juan), Duke of Gandia; and Gioffre Borgia (Jofré in Catalan), Prince of Squillace. He was half-brother to Don Pedro Luis de Borja (146088) and Girolama de Borja, children of unknown mothers. - Captain from Castile is a historical adventure film released by 20th Century Fox in 1947. Directed by Henry King, the Technicolor film starred Tyrone Power, Jean Peters, and Cesar Romero.

The movie starred Tyrone Power as Orsini and Orson Welles as Cesare Borgia . - Romagna (Romagnol: \\"Rumâgna\\") is an Italian historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day Emilia-Romagna. Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven comuni (Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria, Talamello) from the Marche region, which are a small number of comuni where Romagnolo dialect is spoken. Etymology. The name \\"Romagna\\" comes from the Latin name \\"Romània\\", which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century. It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, \\"De Principatibus\\" (\\"About Principalities\\"). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but \\"long before then, in fact since the first appearance of \\"The Prince\\" in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings\\". - The Black Rose is a 1950 20th Century Fox Technicolor film starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles, loosely based on Thomas B. Costain's book. It was filmed partly on location in England and Morocco which substitutes for the Gobi Desert of China. The film was partly conceived as a follow-up to the movie \\"Prince of Foxes\\", and reunited the earlier film's two stars.

The drum beat that opened Taylor Swift âs 1989 made a slow simple statement: â1 â¦ 2 â¦ 3 â¦ and 4!â at a pace roughly appropriate for lurching along in a grocery line with a regularity that even the most drunken campfire-side clapper couldnât mess up. The song âWelcome to New York â kicked off her supposed first âofficial pop albumâ with a portrait of glorious naivety. Swift was the country girl just arrived in the big city amazed by all she saw: the lights the sounds the homosexuals. Her gait was accordingly untroubled steady optimistic: âItâs a new soundtrack / I could dance to this beat forevermore.â The album that followed largely stayed in that shiny straightforward mode. She was open-hearted yet unflappable whether brushing off criticism (âShake It Offâ) lightly dressing the wounds of breakups (âAll You Had to Do Was Stayâ) or memorializing the thrill of a new relationship (âOut of the Woodsâ). Slabs of synth and driving steady beats cast a movie-trailer glow of enchantment. Reviewers noted that this mode actually broke from recent pop trends spurning the influence of hip-hop and R&B as well as some of the grim moodiness creeping onto the charts. The video for âShake It Offâ even poked fun at the idea that Swift might start imitating Nicki Minaj like some of her contemporaries. Two songs didnât quite fit that pattern though. One was âBlank Space â a masterwork of hip-hop-adjacent sarcasm. The legendary pop producers Max Martin and Shellback threaded together a high whistling harmony and kick-drum/snare pattern over which Swift sneered rapid clusters of syllables about being a man-eater. âBad Blood â too waged war in what sounded like a personal feud over modern jock-jam thump. It got an extra layer of syncopation for the Kendrick Lamar remix that like âBlank Space â enjoyed a run at No. 1 on the Hot 100. The rumors about the recording sessions for Swift âs forthcoming album Reputation were that theyâd see her finally diving into hip-hop and R&B. Those reports drew immediate skepticism as it was hard to imagine how such a change might work for Swift without her seeming ridiculous. But it now appears the rumors were true though the question of ridiculousness hasnât quite gone away. Where 1989 was sleek and stiff and retro Reputationâs songs so far have been busier choppier and decidedly modernâwhich is to say rap-influenced.

Summarize this article: An examination of digital equipment recovered from the home of the couple who killed 14 people in San Bernardino last week has led FBI investigators to believe the shooters were planning an even larger assault, according to federal government sources. Investigators on Thursday continued to search for digital footprints left by Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, scouring a downtown San Bernardino lake for electronic items, including a hard drive that the couple was hoping to destroy, sources told The Times. FBI agents will probably spend days searching Seccombe Lake and canvassing the neighborhood for clues after receiving a tip that the couple may have visited the area on the day of the attack, according to David Bowdich, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Farook and Malik were in the final planning stages of an assault on a location or building that housed a lot more people than the Inland Regional Center, possibly a nearby school or college, according to federal sources familiar with the widening investigation. Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Investigators have based that conclusion on evidence left behind on Farook and Malik's computers and digital devices, not all of which the couple were able to destroy before they were killed in a firefight with police, the sources said. Images of San Bernardino-area schools were found on a cellphone belonging to Farook, according to a law enforcement source. But the source cautioned that Farook may have had a legitimate reason to have the images because his work as a county health inspector involved checking on school dining facilities. On Thursday, one of the federal government sources told The Times that Farook asked his friend and neighbor, Enrique Marquez, to buy two military-style rifles used in the attacks because he feared he \\"wouldn't pass a background check\\" if he attempted to acquire the weapons on his own. The rifles were bought at a local gun store, the source said. The timing of the rifle purchases is significant to FBI investigators. Another federal government source previously told The Times that Farook may have been considering a separate terror plot in 2011 or 2012. Farook was self-radicalizing around that time, FBI Director James Comey said, and met Malik soon after, eventually escorting her to the United States. Farook was a practicing Muslim. Marquez converted to Islam around the time he purchased the weapons, sources have told The Times. FBI agents believe Farook abandoned his plans to launch the earlier attack after a law enforcement task force arrested three men in Chino in November 2012. The men were later convicted of charges related to providing material support to terrorists and plotting to kill Americans in Afghanistan. A fourth man arrested in Afghanistan also was convicted in the scheme. Bowdich said federal agents are investigating whether the men had ties to Farook. Marquez has emerged as a central figure in the investigation. The FBI had been conducting interviews with 24-year-old, who checked himself into a mental health facility after the attacks. The former Wal-Mart security guard has waived his Miranda rights and cooperated with the inquiry, and it was Marquez who told FBI agents about Farook's earlier plans, according to one of the government sources, who also requested anonymity. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) \\"They were talking generally about something, but I don't think it made it to anything specific,\\" one of the sources said of the earlier plot. \\"I don't think it got to a time or a place.\\" The source said it remains unclear whether Marquez had any involvement in the planning of the shooting or had any prior knowledge that an attack was pending. Marquez, a cycling enthusiast who wanted to join the U.S. Navy, was a longtime friend and neighbor of Farook. He also married the sister of Farook's sister-in-law last year, although the circumstances of the union are now under investigation, a government official previously told The Times. There was no paperwork transferring ownership of the assault rifles from Marquez to Farook, as required by California law, government officials told The Times. Hours after the shooting, Marquez posted a cryptic message on his Facebook page. \\"I'm. Very sorry sguys,\\" the message read. \\"It was a pleasure.\\" Bowdich on Thursday declined to answer questions about Marquez, who has not been charged with a crime. Marquez told FBI agents that the Facebook post has been \\"misunderstood,\\" according to one of the government sources. Agents are concerned that Marquez's mental and emotional state may affect what he has been telling interrogators, the source said. While Marquez has spoken to agents about his ties to Farook, federal officials are still working to verify the information he has provided, the source said. Marquez's mother, Armida Chacon, addressed reporters on Thursday from her Tomlinson Avenue home in Riverside, sobbing as she said she hadn't been in contact with her son since the day of the massacre. \\"I don't know how this happened.... My world is upside-down,\\" she said. \\"My life changed Wednesday.\\" Chacon was outside with one of her sons, cleaning up the broken glass and twisted panels of their garage door. The damage occurred when federal agents raided the stucco home over the weekend. As she combed through the wreckage of the garage door, Chacon eventually turned to the reporters camped out on the street and agreed to an off-camera interview. Marquez was his mother's \\"right hand at home,\\" helping take care of his brothers, she said. She said her son loved to hang out with friends and go to parties. \\"My son is a good person,\\" she said. When asked about Farook, Chacon said her son was friends with him and \\"nothing more.\\" ||||| SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (Reuters) - A week-old investigation into the shooting rampage that left 14 people dead at a holiday party in Southern California turned on Thursday to a small lake near the scene of the massacre, where divers searched for evidence. FBI agents pack up diving gear after searching in the water at Seccombe Lake Park, after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon The FBI also revealed investigators were looking into any connections there may have been between one of the two killers in San Bernardino last week and four men arrested in 2012 in a separate federal terrorism case brought in nearby Riverside, California. Thursday’s underwater search stemmed from unspecified leads indicating the married couple who carried out the shooting spree had been in the vicinity of Seccombe Lake in San Bernardino on the day of the killings, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI field office in Los Angeles. Bowdich said he would not discuss the “specific evidence we’re looking for.” CNN reported investigators were seeking a computer hard drive that belonged to the couple, who the FBI has said were inspired by Islamic extremists. Bowdich said investigators already have combed the surrounding park, and that the search of the lake by FBI and Sheriff’s Department divers could take days. Seccombe Lake Park lies about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the Inland Regional Center, the social services agency where 14 people were killed and 22 others injured when Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, stormed a holiday gathering of his co-workers there on Dec. 2 and opened fire with assault rifles. Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native he married last year in Saudi Arabia, were slain hours after their attack in a shootout with police. The FBI said it is treating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism, citing the couple’s declaration that they were acting on behalf of the militant group Islamic State, as well as a large cache of weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials seized in the investigation. The couple’s motives remain unclear. But if the crime proves to have been the work of killers driven by militant Islamic ideology, as the FBI suspects, it would mark the deadliest such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2011. The latest slayings and disclosures about the killers’ backgrounds have put law U.S. law enforcement on heightened alert and reverberated into the U.S. presidential campaign, intensifying debates over gun control, immigration and national security. POSSIBLE LINKS TO 2012 PLOT EXAMINED Speaking to reporters at Seccombe Lake on Thursday, Bowdich disclosed the FBI was examining whether Farook had any links with the four conspirators in the Riverside case, as CNN and other media outlets have reported. A jury last year convicted two of those men, including Afghan-born ringleader Sohiel Omar Kabir, of conspiring to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda and plotting to attack U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. Their two co-defendants pleaded guilty in the case. CNN, citing unnamed officials, reported Farook had been a member of Kabir’s social circle. Asked whether the FBI knew of any ties between Farook and the four convicted Riverside conspirators, Bowdich said: “It would be irresponsible not to investigate.” He stressed the four Riverside defendants were never accused of planning attacks within the United States. FBI Director James Comey told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday that the couple were discovered to have been discussing jihad and martyrdom online with each other as far back as 2013, a year before they met in person. Flowers and candles are displayed at a makeshift memorial after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon Comey said the precise origins of the couple’s radicalization were as yet unknown but appeared to predate the rise of Islamic State, the militant group that has seized vast swaths of Iraq and Syria and last month claimed responsibility for the assaults on Paris that left 130 dead. U.S. government sources told Reuters on Thursday that Malik tried in vain to contact multiple Islamic militant groups in the months before she and Farook staged their attack, but her overtures were ignored. The organizations Malik sought out likely shied away out of extreme caution in communicating with individuals unknown to them and a fear of being caught up in a law-enforcement “sting” operation, sources said. The number of organizations that Malik attempted to approach and how she sought to reach them were unclear, though the groups almost certainly included al Qaeda’s Syria-based official affiliate, the Nusrah Front, the government sources said. One source said investigators have little, if any, evidence that Malik or her husband had any direct contact with Islamic State. Slideshow (22 Images) LAWMAKERS BRIEFED While the militant group has since embraced the couple as among its followers, U.S. government sources have said there was no evidence Islamic State even knew of the couple before the San Bernardino killings. Comey, along with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and John Mulligan, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, briefed members of both houses of Congress on Thursday about the investigation in closed, classified sessions. “The current impression is that these two people were acting alone,” U.S. Senator Angus King of Maine told CNN after the briefing. But he added that he was troubled by the fact that the couple had tried to cover their tracks by destroying their cell phones and other electronic equipment. Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters afterward that there were people in the community who saw suspicious activity at the shooters’ house but decided not to tell authorities “for a variety of reasons.” New York Representative Peter King, a senior Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, emerged from the session calling for “more surveillance in the Muslim community here in the United States.” He drew comparisons to heightened scrutiny law enforcement placed on Italian-American and Irish-American communities during past investigations of organized crime. “You look where the terror is going to come from, and right now, it is going to come from the Muslim community,” he said. “It’s a small percentage, but to me, the only way you find out about it in advance is having sources and informers on the ground, having constant surveillance.” Investigators also have been looking into the couple’s ties with Enrique Marquez, a boyhood friend of Farook and Muslim convert who bought the two rifles used in the attack. A federal law enforcement source said Marquez and Farook appear to have contemplated some sort of attack around 2012 but abandoned the idea. Marquez, who is related to Farook’s family by marriage - his wife and the wife of Farook’s older brother are sisters - has not been charged with any crime. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government appears not to have picked up on extremist messages exchanged during the online courtship two years ago between the American-born man accused in the California shootings and his then-fiancée in Pakistan, according to lawmakers detailing closed-door briefings by federal officials on Capitol Hill.

(Associated Press) Frank Kelly, of Victorville, Calif., pays his respects at a makeshift memorial near the Inland Regional Center, the site of last week's fatal shooting that killed multiple people, Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2015,... (Associated Press) American officials say 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, 29-year-old Tashfeen Malik, discussed martyrdom and jihad online as early as 2013. But the couple never surfaced on law enforcement's radar and Malik was able to enter the U.S. on a fiancée visa last year despite having professed radical views online. Meanwhile, the investigation into the shootings that left 14 dead last week continued in San Bernardino, where an FBI dive team searched a small, urban lake about 3 miles north of the shooting site. Authorities said the shooters, who killed 14 people at a holiday gathering on Dec. 2, had been in the area. The couple died in a shootout with law enforcement hours after the attack and left behind a 6-month-old daughter. FBI Director James Comey and other senior American officials briefed members of Congress Thursday. Lawmakers repeatedly questioned officials on whether any red flags may have been missed in the last two years. One official said information that the FBI has been able to glean came from an examination of the pair's electronic devices after the attack, rather than intercepts. \\"Everyone's asking the same questions about how it is that law enforcement didn't know, or intelligence officials didn't know — that they could have flown under the radar and nothing gave an indication that they were a threat,\\" said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode island Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Malik was subjected to an in-person interview during the application process for a visa. He noted that while there were some indications that might have alerted law enforcement to Farook, he declined to detail what those might have been. \\"I don't think we know yet enough to say these were apparent without the advantage of hindsight,\\" Schiff said. Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said there's currently no evidence Malik's radicalization would have been readily apparent when she was evaluated for a fiancée visa. \\"I don't think there was missed information,\\" he said. \\"It appears that there was not any evidence that would have been discoverable during an interview for a visa.\\" He declined to discuss what specifically led investigators to conclude that the couple had radicalized independently as early as 2013, but suggested the information did not come from intercepts. Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar. \\"It's safe to say that the information about what happened prior to their marriage and to the attacks in San Bernardino was acquired through forensic investigations of these individual lives,\\" Hurd said, adding: \\"These people weren't on the radar.\\" Multiple lawmakers raised the fact that neighbors saw suspicious activities but failed to mention them to investigators until after the attack. \\"There were people who were aware of things, thought they were suspicious, but did not want to be accused of being discriminatory for reporting something,\\" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He said these people saw activity around the garage that they thought was suspicious. Asked repeatedly whether any hints could have led law enforcement to prevent the attack, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. replied, \\"Explain to me how you do that without any bread crumbs that are obvious, without somebody that's inside a mosque, that's inside a person's family that tips you off. In this particular case there was nothing like that that gave them a reason to look at this couple sooner than after the attack.\\" More than three years ago, Farook's longtime friend and relative-through-marriage Enrique Marquez bought the assault rifles used in the shooting. Marquez, who checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, told investigators that he and Farook were plotting an attack in 2012. Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, a Republican who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said they had an actual plan, including buying weapons, but became apprehensive and shelved it because of law enforcement activity and arrests in the area. Marquez hasn't been charged with a crime. Lawmakers said the FBI wouldn't provide details about his ties to the case, citing an \\"ongoing criminal investigation.\\" Marquez's mother Armida Chacon told reporters Thursday that her 24-year-old son is a good person. ___ Associated Press writers Brian Melley, Michael R.

England boss Roy Hodgson has been getting some social media stick for his decision to watch Chelsea's Champions League clash with Maribor at Stamford Bridge. The only English player to start the game was John Terry, who retired from international duty in September 2012 after being cleared of racially abusing then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand during a match. So who was Hodgson keeping tabs on at the Bridge? Roy Hodgson beams before kick-off at Stamford Bridge alongside his England assistant Ray Lewington. John Terry makes it 3-0 for Chelsea after running the length of the pitch to add the finishing touch to a counter. England's next Euro 2016 qualification match is on November 15 against Slovenia, where Chelsea's opponents on Tuesday, Maribor, hail from. They were unbeaten in eight Champions League games this season before they ventured to west London, and three of their starting XI on Tuesday were included in the Slovenia squad for qualification matches against Switzerland and Lithuania earlier this month. Mitja Viler. The left-back was at fault for the first goal as Loic Remy cut in from the right-hand side, pushed the ball on to his left foot and then curled a shot into the far corner. Viler was then unfortunate enough to turn Eden Hazard's shot into his own net to make it 4-0 shortly after the break. Subbed off in the 56th minute.

The left-back gets his legs tangled as Eden Hazard's effort flicks off his heel and ricochets in to make it 4-0. Ales Mertelj and Zeljko Filipovic. Maribor's central-midfield pair were always going to struggle against the likes of Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas, two of the most in-form midfielders in not just England but also Europe. Chelsea dominated the centre of the pitch as Mertelj and Filipovic failed to cope with their pace and power. The visitors also created very little going forward as their midfield repeatedly gave the ball away cheaply. So, all in all, not much to worry about for Roy. Ales Mertelj, right, struggles to get near Loic Remy, who opened the scoring for Chelsea with a curling shot.

Question: Information: - A sounding rocket, sometimes called a research rocket, is an instrument-carrying rocket designed to take measurements and perform scientific experiments during its sub-orbital flight. The rockets are used to carry instruments from above the surface of the Earth; the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites (the maximum altitude for balloons is about and the minimum for satellites is approximately ). Certain sounding rockets, such as the Black Brant X and XII, have an apogee between ; the maximum apogee of their class. Sounding rockets often use military surplus rocket motors. NASA routinely flies the Terrier Mk 70 boosted Improved Orion lifting payloads into the exoatmospheric region between . - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space. - In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - In mathematics, an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location. The shape of an ellipse (how \\"elongated\\" it is) is represented by its eccentricity, which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1. - In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Thor - Delta , also known as Delta DM - 19 or just Delta was an early American expendable launch system used for 12 orbital launches in the early 1960s . A derivative of the Thor - Able , it was a member of the Thor family of rockets , and the first member of the Delta family . The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM - 19 configuration . The second stage was the Delta , which had been derived from the earlier Able stage . An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage . The Thor - Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage . This configuration was reused for a large number of later rockets , and a derivative , the Delta II , remained in service into 2011 . The Thor - Delta launched a number of significant payloads , including the first communications satellite , Echo 1A ; the first British satellite , Ariel 1 ; and the first active direct - relay communications satellite , Telstar 1 . All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17 . The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B , while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight , which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due a problem with the second stage . - A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another Small Solar System Body). - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed. - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - The Thor-Able was an American expendable launch system and sounding rocket used for a series of re-entry vehicle tests and satellite launches between 1958 and 1960. It was a two stage rocket, consisting of a Thor IRBM as a first stage, and a Vanguard-derived Able second stage. On some flights, an Altair solid rocket motor was added as a third stage. It was a member of the Thor family, and an early predecessor of the Delta. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'subclass of' with 'launch vehicle'.

Article: Students who get tired of looking at the four walls of a classroom might like to take the nature course being offered by Carvel College again this summer. Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there. Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected.

News article: âTalk That Talkâ by Rihanna Distinctionlessness has become something of a calling card and a weapon for Rihanna, the most consistent pop star of the last five years. Last month she became the fastest solo artist in history to have had 20 Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, slower only than the Beatles. And she has pumped out these hits with little regard for style or mood — breezy dance tracks rub up against poignant, gothically ruptured rock-soul ballads. Her voice is, for the most part, certifiably blank, which is to say it belongs everywhere. But it hasn’t always had a home. “Talk That Talk” (Island Def Jam), her sixth album, is maybe the first to suggest the place that’s been hiding in plain sight all along, placing Rihanna squarely at the center of the pop genre best suited for a singer of her fundamental evanescence: dance music, which conveniently is the mode du jour of contemporary R&B and pop. Rihanna’s version of this sound dates to the club music of the early 1990s, an era in which she would have shone. The best songs on this lively and often great album sound synth-perfect for that time. “We Found Love” almost criminally recalls the swinging Crystal Waters singles, with triumphant percussion somewhere between church and seventh-inning stretch. “Where Have You Been” is even better, with hard, chilly synths, snares from the poppier side of house music, and Rihanna moving in and out of a curled Siouxsie Sioux tone. “I been everywhere, man/looking for someone/someone who can please me,” she sings. “Are you hiding from me yeah/somewhere in the crowd?” “Talk That Talk” is the blithest Rihanna album, which is saying a lot. It has none of the dark, wounded subtext of her more recent albums, almost no sign of scarring left by her tumultuous and abusive relationship with Chris Brown that seemed to hover over her more recent work. It also signals the extent to which the work of polyglot post-soul, post-dance artists like Santigold and M.I.A. have been absorbed into the mainstream. It’s here on songs like “Red Lipstick” (on the deluxe edition) and “Cockiness (Love It),” on which Rihanna is channeling Neneh Cherry, all pseudo-melodic sass. “Cockiness (Love It)” is a particular triumph, its beat by the producer Shondrae a booming industrial jumble, and Rihanna easing out come-ons as if she were lapping up milk. That’s followed immediately by “Birthday Cake,” 80 seconds of squelchy bounce and consumption metaphors. Like Jay-Z and Kanye West’s recent “Watch the Throne,” this album has major parts recorded in hotel rooms, a testament to the globalization and rootlessness of pop, to the outlandish prices of conventional studio time, to the desire to create in an environment of luxury, a liminal space with no repercussions. But that can make for an ungrounded overall experience. When Rihanna veers from the fleet stuff, she’s less certain. “Watch n’ Learn,” which has flickers of Beyoncé’s recent “Party,” has good mouth feel but no taste. And on songs like “Farewell,” the most bombastic one here, it’s tough to tell if the words have feeling, because Rihanna’s voice doesn’t. When she wants to convey emotion, as on “Drunk on Love,” she essentially shouts the lyrics — “I wear my heart on my sleeve!/Always let love take the lead!/I may be a little naïve!” — but staggers around the melody, a victim of trying to feel too hard. “My Life II ... The Journey This record begins with an echo of “My Life,” from 1994, the album often thought to be Mary J. Blige’s best, the one that outlined her as R&B’s gravest diva. On the first track of “My Life,” Sean Combs, her producer, calls Ms. Blige and yells into her answering machine. When she picks up, he jolts her into ambition: he challenges her, warns her against haters, tells her to be on time for the session in the morning. She complies, sounding sleepy but combative. On the first track of this one, she calls Mr. Combs. He is not the producer of this record or anything on it. But he has a stake in its legacy, so she asks him if he minds her recording a follow-up. “It’s not a competitor,” she explains. “It’s a sequel, and an extension of how far we’ve come.” Mr. Combs murmurs something about honesty and life being a marathon, and plugs the older record. As a conversation, even a staged one, it’s so sleepy, so meaningless.

After Blazing Trail, Li Na Exits and Leaves a Gap Despite all of her evident athletic talent and all of her personal sacrifices, Li Na was a late bloomer in tennis, which is one reason — but only one reason — it feels as if she retired too soon. In stepping away because of major knee problems at age 32 years 6 months, she lasted longer on tour than many of the best women’s players of the modern era: longer than Monica Seles or Steffi Graf; longer than Amélie Mauresmo, Kim Clijsters or Justine Henin. But Li had to wait to hit her peak, to shore up her once shaky forehand and confidence, to find the right blend of Eastern and Western expertise. To be frank, which is Li’s way, she never inspired complete confidence under big-match pressure. Even when she was in full flow, gliding powerfully into the corners and generating astonishing flat pace with her strong legs and quick hands, one could never rule out an abrupt shift of focus and fortune. Watching her could be both suspenseful and maddening, and one suspects that if she had chosen to wear a mood ring on court, it would have been flashing a new color with great frequency. In light of all this, she deserves only more credit for finding a way to punch through the doubts and the demons and win her first two Grand Slam singles titles after age 29, something no other woman has managed since the Open era began in 1968. Though she saved the best for late, winning the French Open in 2011 and the Australian Open this year, her timing was still impeccable, and she became a rich woman because of it. Chinese athletes who excel in sports that the West traditionally dominates have a special place in the pantheon: See Liu Xiang in the high hurdles, Yao Ming in the N.B.A. and now Sun Yang in the Olympic swimming pool. Li, once a badminton prospect, will always be the first Chinese and first Asian to win a Grand Slam singles title, and like Yao, she had a personality to which the Western world could warm. A language barrier was no obstacle to perceiving her sense of humor and mischief even if she also could be, on the rough days, as walled off as a hutong courtyard. Like many a funny person, Li had a flip side, as when she stared down a Chinese reporter for a minute that felt like an hour at a Wimbledon news conference in 2013. “She surprised people,” her agent Max Eisenbud said Friday, “because everybody has this stigma of what a Chinese athlete is or should be or should look like. And here she is with a tattoo and an earring on the top of her ear. There was a little bit of the maverick about her, and you don’t really expect that. Her personality, even her feistiness, she was very real.” It was hardly a given that Li would be the first Chinese woman to become a tennis superstar. Frustrated with the rigid national training system, she retired for the first time at 20 to go to college and live unfettered with her future husband, Jiang Shan. And though she later became the first Chinese player to win a WTA singles title, ticking that box in 2004, Zheng Jie, a sturdy and smaller counterpuncher who plays on at 31, blazed a few trails of her own. Zheng and Yan Zi became the first Chinese women to win a Grand Slam doubles title in 2006 at the Australian Open. And in 2008, Zheng, as a 133rd-ranked wild card at Wimbledon, became the first Chinese player to reach a Grand Slam singles semifinal. But Li ultimately won the biggest prizes first, with the help of European coaching, and had the personality to make it doubly memorable. “I think it was because of the whole package,” Eisenbud said. “If Peng Shuai or Zheng Jie would have done the same thing, I honestly don’t think it would have been the same.” We will never know, and though the natural conclusion is that young Chinese players inspired by Li will soon be holding up more major trophies, there are no guarantees. Germany once ruled the tennis world and marketplace with Graf and Boris Becker only to see the sport all but disappear from the radar in a hurry. Since Yao’s retirement, Chinese players are hardly taking the N.B.A. by storm. “The tennis boom in China is not a given,” said Paul McNamee, the former Australian Open tournament director who was part of that event’s push into China and Asia. “It will require nurturing and support. However, with the aura of Li Na and her desire to stay involved, I can see future Grand Slam champions from China within a decade.” Li does intend to remain involved: commercially, philanthropically and developmentally, with an academy in the works and IMG, the sports and media talent agency that has recommitted to tennis under new ownership, looking to leverage her success for the long term. But her forced retirement does once again deprive the WTA Tour of more star power and the opportunity to create what it sorely lacks: a genuine rivalry at the top. Serena Williams has seen plenty of prospects exit the stage earlier than could have been expected: Martina Hingis, Elena Dementieva, Dinara Safina, Henin and Clijsters. “Put it in chronological order, it’s pretty mind-boggling,” said Williams’s childhood coach Rick Macci. Li beat Williams only once in 12 matches and never in a Grand Slam. When Li lost to her for the last time in this year’s Miami final in a summit meeting between No. 1 and No. 2, Carlos Rodriguez, Li’s coach at that time, gave her another pep talk. “ ‘Listen,’ I told her, ‘You are evolving more and more,’ ” he said. “ ‘It takes time. You cannot do what you didn’t do in 17 years in a hurry. You have to believe in it, and if you believe, it will work.’ ” Six months later, Li, the late bloomer, has run out of time and the ability to play through the pain. But her career path was still quite an evolution, and it will be fascinating to see how the game she once rejected evolves from here: in China and beyond.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. Question: What kind of feelings did Steve have for Miss Tennessee? Options: - Very positive feelings. - Ambivalent feelings. - Very negative feelings. - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"Very positive feelings.\\" The text provides ample evidence to confirm that Steve, the dog, harbored very positive feelings towards Miss Tennessee. He is described as loving her a lot, demonstrating the strength of his emotional attachment to her. His affection for her surpassed the bond he shared with the male narrator, as it is articulated in the text that with Miss Tennessee, \\"it was everything else.\\" Steve exhibits a variety of behaviors that showcase his deep affection for her. He would stand with his paws on the side of the tub while she took a bath, which implies a desire to be close to her and participate in her routines. Additionally, when Miss Tennessee went somewhere Steve couldn't access, he would wait where he last saw her, demonstrating an unwavering loyalty and longing for her presence. Even when left alone in the car, Steve would stand with his paws on the dashboard, waiting, crying and looking at the male narrator as if the latter were to blame for her absence. These reactions signify not just positive feelings but a deep emotional dependence on Miss Tennessee. His actions do not point towards ambivalent feelings, which would infer mixed emotions or uncertainty about Miss Tennessee, nor indicate any negative feelings, as there is no evidence that he dislikes or fears her in any way. Therefore, based on the context given, it must be inferred that Steve's feelings for Miss Tennessee were indeed very positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(2) However , a rational curve \`\` is not '' a curve defined over the rationals , but a curve which can be parameterized by rational functions . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While these two sentences seem similar at first glance, they actually convey distinct, albeit related, concepts about rational curves. To understand the differences, it's essential to analyze the terms used and the structure of both sentences. (1) A rational curve \\"is\\", however, not a curve parameterized over the rational, but a curve that can be defined by rational functions. In this sentence, the definition of a rational curve is established as not being a curve parameterized over the rational. Instead, it emphasizes that a rational curve is a curve that can be defined or described by rational functions. Rational functions are mathematical functions created by dividing two polynomials. Consequently, this sentence implies that a rational curve can be understood or represented using rational functions in its description, allowing for convenient mathematical representation and analysis. (2) However, a rational curve \\"is not\\" a curve defined over the rationals, but a curve which can be parameterized by rational functions. This sentence highlights that a rational curve is not a curve defined over the rationals, meaning it is not restricted to having its coordinate values in the rational numbers set (fractions of the form p/q, where p and q are integers). Instead, this sentence focuses on the fact that a rational curve can be parameterized by rational functions. In this context, parameterization refers to the process of expressing the curve by associating each of its points with a unique parameter value, often using rational functions. Thus, this definition implies that you can use rational functions to parameterize a rational curve in a way that simplifies its representation and computation. To summarize, both sentences describe different aspects of rational curves. The first sentence focuses on the idea that a rational curve can be defined by rational functions. In contrast, the second sentence conveys that a rational curve can be parameterized by rational functions but is not limited to having coordinates within the rational numbers set. While related, these two sentences address distinct facets of rational curves' nature and representation through rational functions."},{"prompt":"Q:Aubrey loved the doll very much, because it was the last thing her mother gave her before dying.

Little does she know that this quaint town hides a terrifying secret, one that has haunted its residents for generations – a deadly curse linked to Leslie Mancuso, a violent serial killer from the past. The movie opens with Kelly settling into her new life in Ravenwood, making new friends and trying to cope with her recent loss. As time passes, she starts hearing rumors about mysterious disappearances and unsolved murders, all believed by the townsfolk to be the work of Leslie Mancuso's vengeful spirit. Kelly, a rational thinker, initially dismisses these superstitions as mere urban legends. However, as the townspeople continue to succumb to gruesome deaths, Kelly starts noticing a series of unsettling coincidences and inexplicable events. Among them is a reoccurring, chilling dream she has about Leslie. Her interest is further piqued when she discovers her mother's old diary, which contains cryptic references to Leslie Mancuso, suggesting a connection between the family and the cursed murderer. Seeking answers, Kelly gradually unravels the tragic history of Leslie Mancuso. Born to an abusive family, Leslie embraced a dark path filled with violence and bloodshed, her rampage coming to an end when she was finally caught and executed by the townspeople. However, before being put to death, she vowed to return and wreak vengeance on the descendants of those who caused her demise, the Thompson family being among them.

The statement \\"The sky isn't falling now, kid.\\" suggests the sky is not literally \\"falling,\\" meaning that there isn't a catastrophic event affecting the sky at this specific moment. This statement can more broadly imply that the current situation isn't as dire or disastrous as it might seem, and could be intended to reassure the individual it is directed towards. However, this statement alone cannot provide enough information regarding the state of the world. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"The world isn't ending now.\\" addresses a more general concept. The \\"end of the world\\" may refer to various scenarios, from environmental disasters to widespread disease, political instability to economic collapse, or even to existential risks such as pandemics, nuclear war, or asteroid impacts. Each of these possibilities may have different proximate causes, and their occurrences might not necessarily be signaled through direct indicators. The premise only addresses one particular aspect of the world (the sky) and one moment in time (now). While it implies that there is no immediate and perceivable catastrophe happening, this doesn't preclude the possibility of other significant issues or events developing. For example, negative global trends involving climate change, income inequality, political instability, or other potential world-ending factors could be in progress without causing an immediate existential threat.

Question: What does Naylor promise to do? Movie title: Thank You for Smoking Movie plot: Nick Naylor is a handsome, smooth-talking tobacco lobbyist and the vice-president of a tobacco lobby called the \\"Academy of Tobacco Studies\\", which for 15 years has been \\"researching\\" the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. They claim that their researchâfunded primarily by tobacco companiesâhas found no definitive evidence of any linkage. Naylor's job consists mainly of reporting the questionable research of the \\"Academy\\" to the public and defending Big Tobacco on television programs by questioning opposing health claims and advocating personal choice. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \\"Merchants of Death\\" or \\"The MOD Squad\\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that product placement of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument. Senator Finistirre, one of Naylor's most vehement critics, is the promoter of a bill to add a skull and crossbones POISON warning to cigarette packaging. During a televised debate with Finistirre, Naylor receives a death threat from a caller. Despite the threat, Naylor still plans to appear before a U.S. Senate committee to fight Finistirre's bill. Naylor is then kidnapped and covered in nicotine patches. Awakening in a hospital, he learns that the very high nicotine tolerance level resulting from his smoking has saved him from death by nicotine poisoning, but now he is hypersensitive to nicotine and can never smoke...

Input: TL;DR - my SO of 12 years fails to meet me with his side of the bargain when we decided to be better about giving gifts. I’m getting frustrated. To start out, I’m 26F and my fiancé is 27M, and we have been together for 12 years. We’ve lived together for the past 7 years, and have two small children, 5 &amp; 2. We have a mostly happy life, but the past few years, we’ve gone through a bit of a rough patch financially, so we stopped giving each other gifts for holidays and birthdays, except for the kids. We share finances. Two years ago, we decided we would get back to giving each other gifts, even if it was a card, trinket, etc. Nothing crazy, small gifts. He agreed and seemed excited. Since then, I have given him gifts for his birthday, Father’s Day, Christmas, and sometimes for no other reason than I love him. Most recently for Valentines Day, I gave him a beard care kit (10), a mug (3), a card from the kids and I, and some candy. I set it up as a surprise for him to go into his office and find and I was really excited for him to see it because I enjoy doing special things like that for him. He showed no emotion, gave a half hearted thanks, and hasn’t made any motion towards reciprocating the gift giving. I’m getting increasingly frustrated because it is now past V-Day with no signs of any kind of plan in motion. He does work night shift. I’m trying to be accommodating and understanding, but I’m really sad. I’ve talked to him several times over the past year about it, and his response is that he has no idea what I like. I understand that gift giving might not be his love language, but I have communicated how much it means to me that he meet me in the middle of our deal and he tells me he will get better, but it doesn’t change. I’m not trying to be selfish, and I feel conflicted because should I really be this upset over material things? Probably not, but I can’t help it. AITA?

Context: Austria-Hungary precipitated the Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the \\"powder keg of Europe.\\" In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33-day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond. Question: How many years after the Bosnian crisis was the First Balkan War fought? Answer:","completion":"The Bosnian crisis occurred in 1908-1909, and the First Balkan War was fought in 1912.

His banjo playing annoys Bugs, who saws a hole in the floor and tries to exit.

Answer the following question: Background: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Paragraph: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Answer:","completion":"To determine which ocean on Planet X had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor, we have to consider the presence and distribution of submarine volcanoes. In the given paragraph, it is stated that the Ice Ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while the Tropical Ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Hydrophones are devices used to detect underwater sounds, such as those produced by submarine volcanoes. As a result, they are typically placed in areas with a higher concentration of submarine volcanic activity to monitor and study these phenomena. Given that the Tropical Ocean has a much higher number of submarine volcanoes compared to the Ice Ocean, it is likely that more hydrophones would be installed in the Tropical Ocean. This allows researchers to gather more data on the numerous submarine eruptions occurring in that part of Planet X. Consequently, it can be inferred that the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, would have fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor compared to the Tropical Ocean. The limited number of submarine volcanoes in the Ice Ocean would necessitate a lesser number of hydrophones, as there are fewer events to monitor and study in this region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The provided statement, \\"A son and his father are shopping in the mall for a new skateboard helmet,\\" gives us some clues regarding the situation; however, it is insufficient to reach a decisive conclusion that \\"A boy skateboarding off a concrete slab.\\" From the given information, we can deduce that the boy is likely involved in skateboarding, as he is shopping with his father for a new skateboard helmet. This implies that he either currently skateboards or is planning on participating in the activity shortly. Skateboard helmets are essential safety gear, which lends credence to our assumption that skateboarding is involved. Nevertheless, the information provided does not verify the specific scenario, \\"A boy skateboarding off a concrete slab.\\" We cannot definitively conclude that he is currently skateboarding or has just done so. There is no context relating to the boy's activities involving skating off the concrete slab. Additionally, the fact that the father and son are shopping for a helmet does not tell us anything about the boy's skills, experiences, or the type of terrain he usually encounters while skateboarding. This further supports the idea that we cannot draw a clear conclusion regarding the boy skateboarding off a concrete slab. In conclusion, the best answer is II: \\"It is not possible to tell,\\" as the available information is not enough to determine if the boy is skateboarding off a concrete slab.

Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described...

Russian spelling, which is quite phonemic in practice, is a mix of the \\"morphological\\" and \\"phonetic\\" principles, with a few \\"etymological\\" or \\"historic\\" forms, and occasional \\"grammatical\\" differentiation. The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reformulated on the French and German models. - The letter (italics \\"\\", \\"\\") of the Cyrillic script, also spelled jer or er, is known as the \\"hard sign\\" ( ) in the modern Russian and Rusyn alphabets, as \\"er golyam\\" ( , \\"big er\\") in the Bulgarian alphabet, and as \\"debelo jer\\" ( , \\"fat yer\\") in pre-reform Serbian orthography. The letter is called back yer or back er in the pre-reform Russian orthography, in Old Russian, and in Old Church Slavonic. Originally the yer denoted an ultra-short or reduced middle rounded vowel. It is one of two reduced vowels that are collectively known as the yers in Slavic philology. - Old Church Slavonic, also known as Old Church Slavic (often abbreviated to OCS; self-name , \\"slovnsk jzyk\\"), was the first Slavic literary language. The 9th-century Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius of Slavic, Greek descent, or both, are credited with standardizing the language and using it in translating the Bible and other Ancient Greek ecclesiastical texts as part of the Christianization of the Slavs. It is thought to have been based primarily on the dialect of the 9th century Byzantine Slavs living in the Province of Thessalonica (now in Greece). It played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions, and some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use this later Church Slavonic as a liturgical language to this day. As the oldest attested Slavic language, OCS provides important evidence for the features of Proto-Slavic, the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages. History. The language was standardized for the mission of the two apostles to Great Moravia in 863 (see Glagolitic alphabet for details). For that purpose, Cyril and his brother Methodius started to translate religious literature to Old Church Slavonic, allegedly based on the Slavic dialects spoken in the hinterland of their hometown, Thessaloniki, in the today's Greece. - Neutral Yer ( Majuscule : , Minuscule : ) is used in transcribing documents when it is hard to tell the difference between a and a .

The Glagolitic alphabet used as their respective counterparts the letters and . They originally represented phonemically the \\"ultra-short\\" vowels in Slavic languages (including Old Church Slavonic), collectively known as the yers. In all Slavic languages they either evolved into various \\"full\\" vowels or disappeared, in some cases leaving palatalization of adjacent consonants. At present, the only Slavic language that uses \\"\\" as a vowel sign (pronounced //) is Bulgarian (although in many cases it corresponds to earlier \\"\\", originally pronounced /õ/). Many languages using the Cyrillic alphabet have kept one or more of the yers to serve specific orthographic functions. - The Bulgarian alphabet is used to write the Bulgarian language. - The Cyrillic script is a writing system used for various alphabets across eastern Europe and north and central Asia. It is based on the Early Cyrillic, which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School. It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, past and present, in parts of southeastern Europe and northern Eurasia, especially those of Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. , around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with Russia accounting for about half of them.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

In 325, at the age of 27, Athanasius began his leading role against the Arians as his bishop's assistant during the First Council of Nicaea. Roman emperor Constantine the Great had convened the council in May–August 325 to address the Arian position that the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, is of a distinct substance from the Father. Three years after that council, Athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- For two years, Google has pushed its Google+ as more than a social network or cool video-chatting tool. This week, it is working to hammer home that point with a spate of new features. Google+ isn't an answer to Facebook or Twitter, Google says. It's the connective tissue that more and more is tying Google's most popular products together -- and it will not be ignored. Since it debuted in June 2011, Google+ has seeped into all other parts of the Google ecosystem, tying into other Google offerings like search, Gmail and YouTube.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Life comes in a package. This package includes happiness and sorrow, failure and success, hope and despair. Life is a learning process. Experiences in life teach us new lessons and make us a better person. With each passing day we learn to handle various situations. Love Love plays a pivotal role on out life. Love makes you feel wanted. Without love a person could go hayward and also become cruel and ferocious. In the early stage of our life, our parents are the ones who shower us with unconditional love and care, they teach us about what is right and wrong, good and bad. But we always tend to take this for granted. It is only after marriage and having kids that a person understands and becomes sensitive to others feelings. Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success. It helps us to touch the sky, teaches us to survive and shows us a specific way. Success brings in money, fame, pride and self-respect. Here it becomes very important to keep our head on out shoulder.

Please answer this question: what is the region between mars and jupiter called?","completion":"The region located between Mars and Jupiter is known as the Asteroid Belt. The Asteroid Belt is a circumstellar disc in the Solar System that is occupied by numerous irregularly formed bodies called asteroids or minor planets. This is a peculiar feature in our solar system, a swath of space that contains a large number of substantial chunks of rock that never came together to form a planet. The Asteroid Belt is situated roughly between the orbits of the two planets Mars and Jupiter. It's approximately 1.2 to 2.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun; one AU is the average distance from the Sun to Earth, about 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles. As with planets, asteroids also orbit the Sun in elliptical paths. The vast majority of the objects in the belt are not large, planet-like bodies but rather space debris of varying sizes. The largest object in the Asteroid Belt is the dwarf planet Ceres, which has a diameter of about 940 kilometers. Other substantial bodies of the belt include Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea, all of which have diameters exceeding 400 kilometers. The total mass of all the objects in the Asteroid Belt is quite small compared to Earth. If combined, they would equate to less than 4% of the Earth's total mass, underscoring the relatively small scale of these objects. While there are several hundreds of thousands of asteroids of varying sizes, the distances between individual asteroids are vast, so the likelihood of spacecraft collision is relatively small. The Asteroid Belt is of considerable interest to scientists as it is believed to house materials left over from the early Solar System. These primitive remnants hold vital clues about the formation and evolution of the solar system. For this reason, several missions have been launched to study asteroids in the belt, including NASA's Galileo and Dawn missions. Our understanding of the Asteroid Belt has changed significantly since it was first discovered in the 1800s. Once thought of as a failed planet, it is now understood to be a complex and diverse region of space, which holds much scientific interest for future exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who secured a harness? Monique. Answer:","completion":"Title: The Adventure of Monique Step 1: Introduce the protagonist and her background The protagonist, Monique, is an aspiring, fearless young woman with a deep fascination for adventure, exploring uncharted territories, and solving challenging mysteries. Monique, a skilled climber and hiker, has always dreamt of conquering the world's most daunting peaks. Step 2: Establish the setting and the main conflict The story is set in a small, remote village nestled amidst towering mountains. A legendary mountain peak, known as \\"The Whispering Summit,\\" has captivated the attention of climbers from around the world. However, nobody has ever reached the top due to a mysterious, supernatural force manifesting near the summit, causing climbers to vanish without a trace. Step 3: Present the supporting characters As Monique embarks on her journey, she forms an unlikely alliance with a team of seasoned climbers, each with their own unique set of skills and expertise. Their leader is a wise, experienced mountaineer named Malcolm, who has attempted to reach the summit several times but always come up short. There's also Amelia, a gifted geologist who believes there's a scientific explanation behind the supernatural occurrences. Finally, there's Jonas, Malcolm's goofy yet lovable nephew with a knack for comedic relief in tense situations. Step 4: Monique secures the harness and embarks on the adventure The team prepares for their ascent, with Monique securing her harness with utmost determination. Amidst a fierce blizzard, the climbers face numerous challenges: treacherous terrain, unpredictable weather changes, and sudden encounters with mountain wildlife. Monique's skills and determination prove invaluable to the team, as she leads them higher and higher up the mountain. Step 5: Introduce the antagonist As the team nears the summit, they encounter the supernatural force that has caused countless climbers to vanish - a formidable, enigmatic entity known as \\"The Guardian.\\" The Guardian reveals that it protects an ancient secret hidden at the summit, dating back to a long-lost civilization with unparalleled knowledge and power. Step 6: The climax and resolution Monique, having gained the respect and trust of her fellow climbers, devises a plan to outsmart The Guardian. She combines her climbing skills, harness, and the knowledge of her team members to create a diversion, leading The Guardian into a high-stakes chase through treacherous ground. Ultimately, Monique and her team conquer The Whispering Summit, unlocking the ancient secret. Instead of exploiting the newfound knowledge for personal gain, they decide to keep the secret safe, ensuring that it won't fall into the wrong hands. Step 7: The conclusion In a heartfelt farewell, Monique and her team part ways, with each member thankful for the adventure they shared. Monique, feeling fulfilled by her ultimate accomplishment, returns to her village with the knowledge and confidence that no challenge is too great for her to overcome. Throughout the movie, Monique's actions and decisions are strongly driven by her passion for adventure, her courage, and her unyielding determination to reach the peak. Her securing of the harness symbolizes her preparedness and commitment to face the challenges head-on in the epic adventure that follows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The River Torrens is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains and was one of the reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city's water supply. The river's long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city. - Adelaide city centre is the innermost locality of Greater Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. It is known by locals simply as \\"\\"The City\\"\\" or \\"\\"Town\\"\\" to distinguish it from Greater Adelaide and from the City of Adelaide (which also includes North Adelaide and the parklands). The locality is split into two key geographical distinctions: the city \\"square mile\\", bordered by North, East, South and West Terraces; and the section of the Adelaide Parklands south of the River Torrens which separates the built up part of the city from the surrounding suburbs and North Adelaide. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - The Onkaparinga River is a river located in South Australia south of the Adelaide city centre . It runs from its source between Mount Torrens and Charleston in the Mount Lofty Ranges , and flows south westerly to an estuary at Port Noarlunga . The catchment is over 500 square kilometres ( 190 sq mi ) in area , and in part includes the following protected areas - the Encounter Marine Park , the Onkaparinga River National Park , the Onkaparinga River Recreation Park and the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve . The Onkaparinga River is the second major river within the Adelaide metropolitan area , after the River Torrens . The name derives from the Indigenous Kaurna name Ngangiparri which translates as \`\` The Women 's River '' . In 1837 Surveyor General Col William Light named it Field 's River , or the Field River , after Lieut William George Field RN ( 1804 - 1850 ) of the brig Rapid , who carried out the first surveys in the vicinity of its estuary , but subsequent Governor George Gawler soon reinstated the Indigenous name . The first Europeans to explore its sources and the Onkaparinga Valley were the party of Dr. George Imlay and John Hill in January 1838 . It is a source of fresh water for Adelaide . Mount Bold Reservoir was constructed between 1932 and 1938 along a section of its path approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) inland . Much of its flow is diverted via a tunnel from the Clarendon Weir to the Happy Valley Reservoir , that in turn supplies some 40 per cent of Adelaide 's water supply . Most years the flow to the reservoir is supplemented by water pumped from the River Murray via a pipeline from Murray Bridge . Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'mouth of the watercourse' with 'gulf st vincent'.

Celebration: Brash and friend at the Greenwich party on Monday. He said he hoped winning a gold medal would improve his chances with the ladies. But show-jumper Scott Brash yesterday admitted it hadn’t quite worked out. The single 26-year-old – who won a team gold in the show-jumping on Monday – was seen out celebrating that night in Greenwich. But yesterday, the day he competed in the individual event, he revealed he ended that evening without a lady in tow. He had earlier told BBC presenter Claire Balding, who asked him how the win would change his life: ‘I really hope this win improves my pulling power with women, if I’m honest! That’s about it.’ But yesterday the rider from Peebles said things hadn’t gone to plan. ‘The medal hasn’t had the good effect I hoped for,’ he admitted – adding: ‘I had too good a celebration and a sore head the next day.’ Brash, 26, was one of the British riders who won gold in the team show-jumping on Monday. Both he and veteran Nick Skelton competed again yesterday for individual medals – but both narrowly missed out after incurring faults on the final round. Skelton’s hopes were dashed in Greenwich Park when he hit a fence called Cutty Sark. It was his first error over six rounds of team and individual jumping but it meant he slipped from a potential gold medal jump-off to finish equal fifth with Brash. Despite his disappointment, popular Skelton, who became Britain’s oldest medallist on Monday, received a standing ovation after his performance. Competing: Scott Brash on Hello Sanctos during the Individual Jumping Final Round A at Greenwich Park. Feeling confident: Brash talks to media at a press conference at Greenwich Park. Although he had a hip replacement last year, a shoulder operation the year before that, and has ‘problems walking about’, Skelton was instrumental in Team GB’s victory in team show-jumping on Monday. It was an amazing comeback for the colourful rider, who feared he would never ride again after he was thrown from his horse 11 years ago, broke his back and almost died. When asked about his injuries, Skelton joked: ‘I’ve had two cartilage operations, a shoulder replacement, a hip replacement, a broken neck and I’ve got to get a back replacement – but apart from that I’m fine.’ After finishing his round, the rider shrugged and smiled before taking his hat off for the crowd and clapping the spectators. He was rewarded with an enthusiastic send off, with 23,000 spectators cheering and stamping for the popular rider. Afterwards, the 54-year-old - who is on his sixth Olympics - said he was ‘disappointed’ not to get another medal. Winners: (Left to right) Gold medalists Nick Skelton, Ben Maher, Scott Brash and Peter Charles of Great Britain celebrate on the podium during the medal ceremony for the Team Jumping.

It is great for the sport, great for me.’ Steve Guerdat, 30, ended an 88-year wait for a Swiss gold medallist in individual show-jumping.

Give English regions the same powers as Scotland, says Local Government Association The call from the LGA, which which represents councils in England and Wales, follows Nick Clegg’s insistence that there would need to be changes in the way English and Scots MPs vote in parliament if Scotland rejected independence and acquired more devolved powers. The issue of English MPs getting a greater say on English legislation – the so-called West Lothian question – will also need to be settled, added the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Clegg has previously said that more power must be given to the English regions so they can truly \\"stand on their own feet\\". While the focus in the past decade had been on devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Mr Clegg said England was \\"the forgotten part of the puzzle\\". Mr Sparks said that he was calling for an urgent meeting to discuss the constitution and speed up the process of English devolution. “The appetite for devolution does not stop at the border and the rest of the UK will not be content to settle for the status quo,” he said. “Local areas need to be set free from the grip of Whitehall and allowed to raise and spend money in a way which will best serve the people who live there, from equipping them with the skills for work to being able to build the homes people need,” added Mr Sparks.

Reports says many more could have been taken, investigation underway.","completion":"Title: The Dark Reality of International Adoption: A Look into Children Stolen for Adoption Introduction An alarming report has recently shed light on the disturbing phenomenon of children being abducted for the purpose of adoption in the United States, Sweden, Italy, and France. With the investigation focusing on a twelve-year period between 1977 and 1989, considered the 'peak' adoption period, this article will help uncover the unsettling truths behind these horrific acts and discuss the ongoing attempts to address this unimaginable cruelty. The Abductions and Adoptions During the height of the adoption period, unsuspecting parents in various countries faced the unthinkable as their children were kidnapped by soldiers or other individuals involved in these illicit acts. In some instances, parents were tragically killed, while others were left physically unharmed but emotionally devastated. The stolen children were then taken to the aforementioned countries to be adopted by families who remained largely unaware of the sinister origins of their new family members. Investigators Delve Into the Past In order to understand the scope of these atrocities, a team of investigators has been diligently examining the period between 1977 and 1989. As they work to uncover the details of these heinous acts, the investigators hope not only to bring justice to the families affected but also to shed light on hidden human rights violations from around the world. The Possibility of Many More Cases From the information currently available, it is clear that the number of children stolen during this period is substantial. However, the report also includes an ominous warning about the investigation's limitations—there may be many more cases yet to be discovered. As the investigation continues, we should brace ourselves for the chilling fact that the true scale of child abduction for adoption purposes could be far greater than what has been presently uncovered. Conclusion The recent report on children stolen for adoption in the U.S., Sweden, Italy, and France between 1977 and 1989 is a stark reminder of the unfathomable cruelties that can be perpetrated under the guise of assisting orphans and vulnerable children. As the investigation proceeds, it is essential for the international community to come together and find ways to address, prevent, and mitigate such despicable acts. For the sake of the countless families who have been torn apart by these crimes, we must work together to end this dark chapter in history and ensure it never happens again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose less chemical compounds produced happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"If human industry produces fewer chemical compounds, it is likely to result in less damage caused by acid rain. To better understand this, let's break down each step of the process and see how reducing chemical compounds can improve the situation. 1. Human industry produces chemical compounds: It is mainly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas that release pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These are the primary precursor compounds for acid rain. 2. Chemical compounds rise into the air: Once sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted, they ascend into the atmosphere and can be transported over long distances depending on wind patterns and other meteorological factors. This means that the effects of acid rain can occur far away from the initial emission source. 3. Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds: When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with water vapor, oxygen, and other elements in the sky, they form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, making the clouds more acidic. 4. The affected rain falls to the earth: When clouds containing these acidic compounds release precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or fog), the resulting liquid is acidic. This is commonly referred to as acid rain. 5. The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content: Acid rain has various damaging effects on the environment and man-made structures. It can cause soil and water pollution, damage to plants, trees, and aquatic life, and corrode buildings, statues, and other infrastructures. Now, if we assume that less chemical compounds are produced due to changes in human industry – for example, through increased use of renewable energy sources or cleaner technologies – the concentration of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere will decrease. This reduction in precursor compounds will lower the formation of acidic compounds in the clouds, resulting in less acidic rain. With less acidic rain, we can expect a reduction in damages caused by acid rain, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and weakened vegetation or forest ecosystems. Moreover, with a lower acidic content in precipitation, the corrosion of buildings and infrastructure will also lessen, ultimately leading to less damage to both natural and man-made objects. Therefore, the correct answer is B: less damage by acid rain. By reducing the production of chemical compounds responsible for acid rain, there will be a decrease in the environmental and structural damages associated with this phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious attempt on the part of the liar to...

A total of 9 bullets was found, and the various tests and analysis have confirmed that they were indeed fired at the animal in the 19th Century. Nine of the wounds on the animal are believed to have been caused by Enfield Pattern 1853 muskets. These old injuries were concentrated around the animals tail and hind legs, suggesting that the alligator could have possibly been used as a target for shooting practice by Confederate troops. The huge animal also bore five other bullet wounds from three different calibers of hunting guns, as well as many dents and scars, which shows that it survived many firearm injuries in the past. It did not however, survive the six 50-caliber bullets fired at him by the group of amateur hunters from Jackson, who were finally able to take it down. The bullets were confirmed as true musket from between 1850 and 1870. This incredible animal brings a whole new view on this large animal native to the southeastern United States. American alligators have been known for years to live well over 50 years and were thought capable of possibly living as long as 70 or 80 years, but this one was estimated to have been 185 years old at the time of its death.

Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single \\"Creep\\" in 1992. Radiohead recorded their debut release, the Drill EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992. With the release of the \\"Creep\\" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as \\"a lily-livered excuse for a rock band\\", and \\"Creep\\" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed \\"too depressing\\". Radiohead released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK charts, as \\"Creep\\" and its follow-up singles \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" and \\"Stop Whispering\\" failed to become hits. \\"Pop Is Dead\\", a non-album single, also sold poorly. Some critics compared the band's early style to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them \\"Nirvana-lite\\", and Pablo Honey failed to make a critical or a commercial impact upon its initial release. Despite shared influences with popular guitar acts, and some notice for Yorke's falsetto, Radiohead toured only British universities and clubs. In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. \\"Creep\\" had been played frequently on Israeli radio by influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit in that country, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first live gig overseas. Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station KITS added \\"Creep\\" to its playlist. Soon other radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for \\"Creep\\" was in heavy rotation on MTV. The song rose to number two on the US modern rock chart, entered the lower reaches of the top 40 pop chart, and hit number seven in the UK Singles Chart when EMI rereleased it in the UK in September. Unexpected attention for the single in the US prompted EMI to improvise new promotional plans, and the band shuttled back and forth between continents, playing more than 150 concerts in 1993. Radiohead nearly broke up due to the pressure of sudden success as the Pablo Honey supporting tour extended into its second year. The band members described the tour as difficult to adjust to, saying that towards its end they were \\"still playing the same songs that [they had] recorded two years previously ... like being held in a time warp\\", when they were eager to work on new songs. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects about this article.

John Pulman was the king of the 1960s, when the world championship was played on a challenge basis. However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper. Ray Reardon became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with John Spencer (snooker player) winning three. Steve Davis first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999).

Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985.

Write highlights for this article: Vladimir Putin has said that a war between Russian and neighbouring Ukraine is unlikely and that he hopes it 'never happens'. Speaking to Russian state TV, the President called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario'. This comes as an international security watchdog has warned of several breaches of the ceasefire agreed between Ukranian state troops and separatist rebels. Anti-war: Vladimir Putin, pictured yesterday, called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario', adding that he hopes it 'never happens' 'I think that such an apocalyptic scenario [war] is unlikely and I. hope this will never happen,' he told a reporter with Russia. State TV company. This weekend's prisoner swap between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels took place after Putin agreed to use his influence on the separatists during a conference call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. Today, Putin said he did not see the need for another meeting with the leaders of France, Germany and Ukraine on resolution of the conflict. This follows a statement by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that although the current cease-fire has 'very significantly' lowered the level of military exchanges in Ukraine, violations are still taking place. Lamberto Zannier, head of OSCE, said Monday there have been a number of violations in the south, and some limited incidents around the town of Debaltseve and around the Donetsk airport, both seized by separatists. Vladimir Putin, seen at a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier, during the 'Day of the Fatherland's Defender'-celebrations yesterday, said he 'did not see the need' for more peace meetings. Zannier called the agreed ceasefire 'the best chance ... to de-escalate and bring this conflict to an end,' but he stressed that 'there is work to be done.' Today, Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine said they have begun a large-scale pullback of heavy weapons in line with the peace plan. The claim by Eduard Basurin, a top rebel commander, couldn't immediately be confirmed. Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the observer mission that is monitoring the fighting in eastern Ukraine, said he couldn't comment until receiving monitors' reports at the end of the day. The peace plan that was signed February 15 calls for heavy weapons to be pulled back by each side from the front line by 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 45 miles), depending on their caliber. Disturbing the peace: The OSCE has reported that although the cease-fire has 'very significantly' lowered the level of military exchanges in Ukraine, violations are still taking place. Pro-Russian: Locals greet separatists during a rally to mark the 'Defender of the Fatherland Day' in Donetsk, following several reports of cease-fire violations. The cease-fire has been troubled by violations, leading to concern that it wouldn't solidify and that fighting would continue. A rebel website cited Basurin as saying about 100 122-mm howitzers would be moved on Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian side, but military officials have said that they won't pull back weapons until a cease-fire fully takes hold. On Tuesday, military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh said rebels had shelled the town of Popasna seven times and launched one barrage on the village of Luhanske. Stelmakh also said rebels tried to storm Ukrainian positions near the southern village of Shyrokyne, which is near the strategic Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Concerns persists that rebels aim to take Mariupol to help establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed last March.","completion":"1.

Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Marion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley (June 3, 1930 - September 25, 1999) was an American author of fantasy, historical fantasy, science fiction, and science fantasy novels, and is best known for the Arthurian fiction novel The Mists of Avalon, and the Darkover series. While some critics have noted a feminist perspective in her writing, her popularity has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations against her of child sexual abuse and rape by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, among many others. Zimmer Bradley's first child, David R. Bradley, and her brother, Paul Edwin Zimmer, also became published science fiction and fantasy authors. In 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of three to 12. In an email to The Guardian, Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because: I thought that my mother's fans would be angry with me for saying anything against someone who had championed women's rights and made so many of them feel differently about themselves and their lives. I didn't want to hurt anyone she had helped, so I just kept my mouth shut. Greyland also claimed that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, Walter H. Breen, for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. By her own admission, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him. In response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that it will donate all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. The author Janni Lee Simner, who has continued to write works in Bradley's Darkover series, announced on June 13, 2014 that she would be donating advances from her two Darkover books, her Darkover royalties and at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. Since the allegations were made public, Greyland and her brother Mark have spoken at length about their experiences and a number of famous science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as \\"horrific\\". Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote \\"All of which makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\\" G Willow Wilson, World Fantasy award winner, said she was \\"speechless\\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \\"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland's posts about her mother.\\" Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"This article sheds light on several interesting aspects, beyond the literary achievements of Marion Zimmer Bradley, an American author known for her works in fantasy and science fiction genres. The most significant aspect that stands out is the controversy that surrounds her personal life, specifically the allegations of child sexual abuse and rape brought forth by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland. Moira Greyland's accusation in 2014 reveals the complexities of coming forward with such allegations, especially against a well-regarded public figure. She mentions her hesitation to speak up against her mother because of the potential backlash from her mother's fans who held her as a champion of women's rights. This highlights the challenge faced by survivors of abuse in cases involving influential individuals. Furthermore, the article notes Marion Zimmer Bradley's knowledge and inaction regarding her husband, Walter H. Breen's child molestation activities. This brings into focus the issue of enabling and complicity in situations involving abuse. In response to these allegations, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that they would donate proceeds from her e-book sales to the charity Save the Children. This indicates how the publishing industry can take a stand and support causes by taking actions against authors facing such serious accusations. Another fascinating dimension is the impact of these revelations on fellow authors, particularly those who have worked with or have been influenced by Bradley. Authors like Janni Lee Simner, Diana L. Paxson, John Scalzi, Jim C. Hines, and G Willow Wilson are mentioned as expressing their shock, disappointment, and condemnation of Bradley's actions, and some even going as far as donating their earnings from related works to organizations fighting against sexual assault. In summary, this article offers a striking look at the darker side of a renowned author's life, while also shedding light on the intricacies of coming forward with abuse allegations, the reactions of the literary community, and the potential consequences for individuals involved in such scandals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It took longer to read the book than the letter because the","completion":"book was an extensive, thought-provoking exploration of the human experience, delving deep into the hearts and minds of the characters it followed. The letter, on the other hand, was a concise, to-the-point missive, quickly conveying the desired message without unnecessary embellishments. Therefore, the sheer disparity between the two texts elucidates why it took far longer to read the book in comparison to the letter. From the moment the first page was turned, the book captivated its reader with richly drawn characters, each with their own intricately woven backstories and complex motivations. The narrative unfolded at a leisurely pace, allowing the reader ample time to immerse themselves in the tapestry of the fictional world. The author took great care to unravel the intricate plotline, offering surprising twists and turns that kept the reader eagerly engaged. Each chapter introduced new concepts and ideas that required careful contemplation; the prose was beautiful and, at times, even poetic, ensuring that the reader had to pause and appreciate the craftsmanship that went into every sentence. In contrast, the letter was written with a clear, specific purpose in mind: to convey a certain message or compelled action from the recipient. The language was straightforward and unadorned, with a focus on getting the point across in as few words as possible. There was no backstory to uncover, no deeply-developed characters to follow as they navigated their lives. The letter was merely a tool of communication, intended to be read, understood, and then discarded once it had achieved its goal. Additionally, the nature of a book often lends itself to being read over a longer period of time. It can be a source of pleasure or solace, as one delves into another world or universe, escaping the mundane and experiencing something extraordinary. A book can be a companion, there in moments of solitude, to be picked up and put down as time and emotions allow. It can be read at leisure, its words absorbed, its ideas pondered, and its impact felt long after the final page has been turned. On the other hand, the letter's brevity and directness mean that it can be read in a matter of minutes, with the reader often able to absorb and respond to its contents without delaying or breaking stride. The letter does not ask for an investment of time or emotional energy, because it is meant to be concise and efficient, avoiding any unnecessary complexity that might obscure its intended meaning. All these factors contribute to the undeniable fact that the book took far longer to read than the letter. The difference in their length, complexity, language, and even the emotional connections built while reading them all played crucial roles in determining the amount of time required to sift through their pages. While the letter served its purpose and left little to contemplate, the book was a journey, a powerful exploration of human experience and all its complexities, carried out over countless hours spent absorbed in its well-crafted narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: North and South Korea fired hundreds of artillery shells into each other's waters Monday in a flare-up of animosity that forced residents of five front-line South Korean islands to evacuate to shelters for several hours, South Korean officials said. South Korean Marines fired artillery shells across a disputed sea border after North Korean shells from a live fire drill conducted by Pyongyang fell into the water south of the frontier, Seoul officials told the Associated Press. There were no reports of any injuries. Residents on front-line South Korean islands spent several hours in shelters during the firing, and officials temporarily halted ferry service linking the islands to the mainland. Kang Myeong-sung, speaking from a shelter on Yeonpyeong island, which is in sight of North Korean territory, said he didn't hear any fighter jets but heard the boom of artillery fire. North Korea fired 500 rounds of artillery shells over more than three hours, about 100 of which fell south of the sea boundary, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said later Monday. South Korea responded by firing 300 shells into North Korean waters, he said. No shells from either side were fired at any land or military installations, but Kim called the North's artillery firing a provocation aimed at testing Seoul's security posture. There was no immediate comment from North Korea. The exchange of fire followed Pyongyang's earlier, unusual announcement that it would conduct the drills, a move seen as an expression of Pyongyang's frustration at making little progress in its recent push to win outside aid. The world is watching the artillery exchange between the Koreas with concern. White House spokesman Jonathan Lalley called North Korea's actions \\"dangerous and provocative\\" and said they will only deepen its isolation. The U.S. remains steadfast in its commitment to the defense of its allies and is working in close coordination with South Korea and Japan, Lalley said Monday. Russia also urged restraint. \`\`We are worried about the mutual toughening of rhetoric, including the declaration by North Korea that it could conduct a new nuclear test,'' Reuters reported the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday. The Russians also criticized the U.S. for holding military exercises with South Korea which it said were aggravating the situation. The poorly marked western sea boundary has been the scene of several bloody naval skirmishes between the Koreas in recent years. In March 2010, a South Korean warship sank in the area following a torpedo attack blamed on Pyongyang that left 46 sailors dead. North Korea denies responsibility for the sinking. In November 2010, a North Korean artillery bombardment killed four South Koreans on Yeonpyeong. The North has gradually dialed down its threats since last year's tirade and has sought improved ties with South Korea in what foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure investment and aid. There has been no major breakthrough, however, with Washington and Seoul calling on the North to first take disarmament steps to prove its sincerity about improving ties. Recent weeks have seen an increase in threatening rhetoric and a series of North Korean rocket and ballistic missile launches considered acts of protest by Pyongyang against annual ongoing springtime military exercises by Seoul and Washington. The North calls the South Korea-U.S. drills a rehearsal for invasion; the allies say they're routine and defensive. \\"The boneheads appear to have completely forgotten the fact that Yeonpyeong island was smashed by our military's bolt of lightning a few years ago,\\" a North Korean military official, Yun Jong Bum, said Monday, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. Pyongyang also threatened Sunday to conduct a fourth nuclear test, though Seoul sees no signs it's imminent. Wee Yong-sub, a deputy spokesman at the South Korean Defense Ministry, said the North Korean warning about the live-fire drills Monday was a \\"hostile\\" attempt to heighten tension on the Korean Peninsula. Recent threats are an expression of anger and frustration over what the North sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with South Korea and the U.S., said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University. Lim said the North might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What is MongoDB good for? Question 2: What is MongoDB not good for? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same because they are asking about the strengths and weaknesses of MongoDB. Each question focuses on a different aspect of the platform: what it does well and where it is not suitable. Let me provide you with detailed explanations for each question. Question 1: What is MongoDB good for? MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database designed for modern applications requiring flexibility, scalability, and high-performance. It is particularly good for the following applications: 1. Big Data and Analytics: MongoDB can handle a massive volume of data, allowing it to process and analyze huge datasets in real-time. 2. Real-time Processing: MongoDB is designed to handle high-velocity data with low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications, such as social networks, IoT, and gaming. 3. Highly Flexible Schema: MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, which allows for easy and efficient management of data structures as they evolve over time. This feature makes it a great fit for applications with complex or changing requirements. 4. Content Management Systems (CMS): MongoDB is an excellent choice for building scalable and flexible CMS platforms that can handle large amounts of content and support different media types. 5. Geospatial Data: MongoDB has built-in geospatial indexing, making it an ideal choice for location-based applications, such as mobile maps and logistics management platforms. 6. Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scalability through sharding, which divides a large dataset across multiple servers. This capability allows for virtually limitless growth of your database, making MongoDB well-suited for applications with huge amounts of data. Question 2: What is MongoDB not good for? Although MongoDB is a powerful and versatile database solution, it may not be the best fit for certain types of applications or use cases: 1. Applications Requiring Complex Transactions: MongoDB doesn't support multi-document ACID transactions until version 4.0. While the recent versions provide support for ACID transactions, it's not as mature as its counterparts in traditional relational databases. Hence, if your application relies heavily on complex transactions, it might be better to use a relational database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle. 2. Strictly Structured Data: MongoDB excels when handling semi-structured or unstructured data, but if your application requires highly structured data with a stable, predefined schema, using a traditional relational database might be more suitable. 3. Heavy Reliance on Joins: MongoDB employs a document-based model, and while it does support joins, the performance can degrade if your application frequently requires complex joins between multiple collections. In such cases, a relational database could be more appropriate. 4. Full-Text Search: Although MongoDB has some text-search capabilities, it is not as powerful or flexible as dedicated full-text search engines like Elasticsearch or Apache Solr. If your application requires advanced full-text search capabilities, consider using these technologies alongside MongoDB. 5. Applications with Single-Server Constraints: MongoDB performs best when deployed across a cluster or on multiple servers.

I can use this background: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] Now, I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Answer this question please: Was the breakdown of complex molecules lesser or greater in Valley Forest? A:","completion":"The breakdown of complex molecules was lesser in Valley Forest. This is because it had a drier environment due to the drainage system composed of ditches dug by the locals. Even though both forests experienced similar rain amounts, the drainage system in Valley Forest reduced the water saturation, which led to a lower rate of wood decay compared to Peak Forest. Wood-decay fungi require excessive moisture for colonization and proliferation, so the lesser moisture in Valley Forest resulted in fewer fungi and lesser breakdown of complex molecules."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty).

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"The linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"The cake was eaten,\\" can be analyzed from various perspectives such as grammar, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics. By considering these aspects, we can evaluate the sentence's overall integrity and effectiveness in conveying its intended meaning. 1. Grammar: From a grammatical standpoint, the sentence is well-constructed. It follows the standard English language sentence structure, which consists of a subject, verb, and object. In this case, \\"The cake\\" is the subject, \\"was\\" is the auxiliary verb, and \\"eaten\\" is the main verb in the passive voice form. The sentence employs the passive voice to emphasize the action (cake being eaten) and deemphasize the agent who performed the action. Overall, it is grammatically correct and coherent. 2. Semantics: In terms of semantics, the sentence conveys a clear and straightforward meaning, stating that the cake was consumed. The individual words used in the sentence – \\"cake\\" and \\"eaten\\" – have specific meanings that are easily understood in context, and the auxiliary verb \\"was\\" effectively establishes the passive voice. Therefore, the sentence is semantically sound and communicates its message effectively. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics refers to the context and the way language is used to communicate in specific situations. While the sentence \\"The cake was eaten\\" is grammatically and semantically correct, its pragmatic value depends on the intended context. If this statement is in response to a question about the cake's whereabouts, it effectively answers the question. However, if mentioned without any context, it may leave readers wondering who ate the cake, for what occasion, or when it happened. It lacks specificity about the event, which could limit the sentence's pragmatic value. 4. Stylistics: Stylistically, the sentence is simple, concise, and easy to understand. It employs the most basic sentence structure and uses clear, everyday language. While the passive voice can sometimes be considered less engaging or less informative than the active voice, in this case, it works well, as it conveys the action and focuses on the cake. However, depending on the context and purpose, the sentence may benefit from additional details, embellishments, or a more engaging narrative style. In summary, \\"The cake was eaten\\" exhibits strong linguistic integrity in terms of grammar, semantics, and stylistics. However, its pragmatic effectiveness depends on the context in which it is used. Overall, it is a clear and concise sentence, but it may require additional information or context to convey a more complete and engaging narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Along with 10-year-old Destiny and Bob's #1 fan Carol-Ann, who is Laura going up against in the butter-carving competition? Brooke A:","completion":"Title: \\"Butter Destiny\\" The story centers around three main characters: Laura, a single mom and dedicated amateur butter-carver; Destiny, her precocious and imaginative 10-year-old daughter; and Carol-Ann, a quirky, endearing Bob Ross super-fan who is their next-door neighbor. Seizing the opportunity at the local butter carving competition, they unite and get ready to compete against Brooke, their biggest competitor. Laura never romanced the idea of butter carving before, she was more of a pragmatic woman, but when Destiny expresses an interest in this peculiar art form, she takes it up, not just to develop her artistic side but also as a way to build her relationship with Destiny. Carol-Ann provides emotional support and well-needed comic relief. Laura's unknown talent for butter carving gets released and she becomes an overnight sensation in their small town. Brooke, the antagonist, is a blue-blooded, high society, reigning champion of the butter carving competition. With some many times champion butter carving mom, she’s inherited the talent and the pompous attitude that feels threatened by Laura and Destiny's passionate talent. The whole district knows that standing against Brooke means a battle against years of dedication and perfection. Their quiet life takes an unexpected turn when Laura's butter sculpture catches the eye of the butter carving committee. Suddenly she is invited to participate in the town's biggest competition. Brooke is not pleased with the new competition, and this sets the stage for a deliciously intense butter carving rival story. Brooke goes out of her way to sabotage Laura's work, provoking dramatic confrontations and mounting tension. Destiny dreams of overthrowing Brooke's reign and delivering the championship to her mom, who she sees as the most deserving. She provides a unique insight into the carvings, their meanings, and vibrant imagination that sets their artworks apart. Carol-Ann, in her humble and quirky ways, stands by them, raising morale, and occasionally even showing her own artistic skills, inspired by her idol, Bob Ross. With Brooke’s harsh tactics, Laura and Destiny face multiple setbacks but they never give up. Amid trials they not only carve intricate butter sculptures but also their own destinities. Carol-Ann, their unwavering support, always manages to lighten up their atmosphere with her eccentricities based on Bob Ross's famous quotes or paintings. The movie culminates in a nail-biting finale competition where Brooke delivers a flawless piece representing the family's legacy; nevertheless, it lacks the heart that Laura's piece, inspired by her life changes after Destiny, and the quote from Carol-Ann's idol Bob, \\"there are no mistakes, only happy accidents.\\" \\"Butter Destiny\\" not only showcases the intense rivalry between Laura and Brooke but also unfolds their personal development, the evolving mother-daughter bond, and an unsuspected friendship that goes beyond the butter carving competition. This kitschy comedy-drama offers a compelling mix of small-town politics, unlikely friendships, humor, and a lot of butter. It underlines the essence of creativity, integrity, and courage, reminding us that art is not always about perfection but the love and passion put into it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86). Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec. Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did Zapata give up at that point or do something else?","completion":"No, Zapata did not give up at that point. Instead, he continued trying to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement and remained active at the front.

By Associated Press A 56-year-old woman who was found living in filth had been held captive for years by her brother in dungeon-like conditions inside their Connecticut home, police said Friday. The frail, malnourished woman was covered in urine and human feces when police conducting a welfare check found her Thursday night, according to Paul Satkowski, deputy chief of the Seymour police. A lock was on the outside of her bedroom door and the room's windows were blacked out with paint. The woman's brother, Arthur Gauvin, 58, was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment and cruelty to persons. The brother and sister lived in the same house with other relatives, including children. House of horror: Arthur Gauvin allegedly kept his own sister a prisoner in the home they shared in","completion":"Seymour, Connecticut, subjecting her to appalling conditions and unimaginable cruelty. When police officers arrived at the scene for the welfare check, they were shocked by the squalid environment the victim was forced to live in. It was apparent that she had been isolated from the outside world, with her movements meticulously controlled and restricted by her captor. The investigation revealed that the situation had been ongoing for several years, as the victim languished in her makeshift cell while her abuser maintained a facade of normalcy within the rest of the house. Despite other family members residing in the same home, the extent of the victim's suffering was seemingly hidden from them. As the case unfolded, the local community was left reeling, questioning how such a horrific scenario could transpire right under their noses. Neighbors expressed shock and disbelief at the events, with many claiming no suspicion of any wrongdoing at the residence. Following Gauvin's arrest, the victim was immediately taken to a nearby hospital for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment. Medical professionals assessed her physical and mental well-being, working to ensure a smooth transition to a safe and supportive environment. In the aftermath, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families was also involved to review the welfare of the other residents in the house, mainly the children. This harrowing case serves as a stark reminder of the hidden atrocities that can occur behind closed doors. It is a call to action for communities to be vigilant and proactive in reporting any suspicious activity or concerns regarding their neighbors' well-being. The swift intervention by law enforcement in this case has brought an end to the victim's nightmare. Meanwhile, Arthur Gauvin will face the full weight of the justice system for his heinous actions, answering for the years of suffering he imposed on his sister."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ryan, who was 3 at the time, began making silly faces at Walter and chatted about going home to change into his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume. Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player.

He was 6. The Facebook page was for the Ryan Lamantia Foundation, a non-profit organization that Ryan's family formed after his death to raise money for brain cancer research. Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where in the castle was the last room that was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan?, using the article: In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work. The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

Years after throwing a bottle-up note into a lake for a class project and just one year after his death, a man's childhood message was found and returned to his mother.

I stayed at Pittsburgh for 5 days, and one of my most memorable experiences was eating at Burgatory. When you look at the menu, you must start off with the shakes, and I will guarantee that you'll have a hard time deciding which one to get. They also have hard shakes with amazing descriptions, but sadly I am under 21 :( It didn't really matter because the salted nutella crunch (nutella with nestle crunch bars) was ridiculously addicting and I could have been happy at the restaurant just eating the shake. However, this place is a burger joint so we obviously have to mention those too. You can either choose a burger from the menu or you can make your own by marking off on a paper menu the kind of meat, bun, rub, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want for your burger. You should try the truffled shallot aioli sauce and add avocados to your burger if you like them! The burgers were juicy and the beef was a perfect medium rare. Because there are so many toppings, they are stabilized with a mini pitchfork, which is so suitable because my whole meal was just really sinful. The burgers come with regular and sweet potato chips on the side but trust me and order the truffled gorgonzola fries to eat with your burger. We didn't get our burgers for a long time, but my boyfriend and I didn't really notice since we were talking the whole time and were distracted by how good the shake was. It must have been over 45 minutes though, and the manager came out to apologize and reassure us that the burgers were coming right away. When we got our check, the prices of the burgers were subtracted from the total so we basically got them for free. I was floored by the manager's gesture and the great customer service. I will definitely hit up Burgatory again when I return to Pittsburgh and get the chance to go.

The given premise appears to be a fragment of a conversation and lacks a full context. While it is challenging to draw conclusions from such a fragment, it is still possible to offer an analysis and interpretation. The phrase \\"yeah well we've we've gotten to the point where you know if if if well\\" seems to indicate that the speaker has reached a certain point in time or understanding, suggesting that they believe the listener is also aware of the circumstances leading up to this point. The repetition of \\"we've\\" and \\"if\\" could imply hesitation or uncertainty, as if the speaker is somewhat tentative in asserting this claim, or it might simply be a verbal filler. From this analysis, we can attempt to address the hypothesis \\"At this point you know.\\" The original premise suggests an assumption that the listener has a shared understanding or knowledge of the given situation. In this interpretation, the hypothesis holds true to a certain extent, as the premise seems to assume that the listener is aware of the circumstances or context surrounding the subject. However, it is essential to note that the initial premise is fragmented and lacks definite context. As a result, it is challenging to affirm the hypothesis with absolute certainty. If we had more context or a larger portion of the conversation, we could better establish the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. In summary, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"At this point you know\\" appears to be true to some extent, as it seems the speaker assumes the listener is aware of the context surrounding the subject.

The United States is planning to deploy about 150 soldiers for military exercises to begin in Poland and Estonia in the next few weeks, a Western official said Saturday. The exercises would follow Russia's buildup of forces near its border with Ukraine and its annexation last month of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said earlier this week that the U.S. is looking for ways to reassure its NATO allies of its strong commitment to collective defense. Exercises: The U.S. already has two warships docked in the Black Sea capable of launching a missile-defense system. Russia: The U.S. wants to reassure its allies that it is committed to defending against a threat from pro-Russian forces (pictured) in the Ukraine. The Pentagon's press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said in a statement Friday that American officials are considering a range of additional measures to bolster air, maritime and ground readiness in Europe. Ground exercises in Poland and Estonia would last about two weeks but such exercises would continue on a rotating basis off and on over time, the official said, and other locations in Eastern Europe would be considered. The official was not authorized to discuss the plan by name because it has not been made final and requested anonymity. No specific date for the deployment of an Army company, which usually consists of 150 soldiers, has been set but an announcement was expected next week, the official said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says 'there's an entire range of possibilities and measures that are being considered. Kirby's statement about additional measures didn't offer specifics. 'Some of those activities will be pursued bilaterally with individual NATO nations. Some will be pursued through the alliance itself,' he said. On Thursday, Hagel met at the Pentagon with his Polish counterpart, Tomasz Siemoniak, and told reporters that they had identified new areas of military-to-military cooperation, including special operations forces, air forces and additional military exercises and training, as part of their discussion of closer defense ties. 'Thereâ€™s an entire range of possibilities and measures that are being. considered,' Hagel said on Thursday in a joint. news conference with Siemoniak. 'Rotational basis of training and exercises are always part of that.' Unstable: Ukrainian troops killed three pro-Russian fighters who attacked a National Guard base in the Ukraine. Three additional Russian militants were killed in a gun battle near the eastern Ukrainian town of Slavyansk. In an interview with The Washington Post, Siemoniak said the decision to deploy U.S. ground forces to Poland had been made on a political level and that details were being worked out, the newspaper reported. 'The idea until recently was that there were no more threats in Europe and no need for a U.S. presence in Europe any more,' Siemoniak said, speaking through an interpreter during a visit Friday to the newspaper. 'Events show that what is needed is a re-pivot, and that Europe was safe and secure because America was in Europe,' he continued.

To ensure that his orders are followed, the Governor assigns a police escort to the plane, who must accompany the group on their journey. However, the group devises a plan to circumvent the Governor's orders and the police escort. Marty Melville (Lon Chaney, Jr.) lures the policeman away from the plane and manages to board the aircraft without the escort. As they take off, the policeman fires at the departing airplane and the tower orders them to return to the field. Despite these attempts to prevent them from continuing their flight, the group decides to go against the order and fly toward the restricted area of the Tarahumare Mountains. It is important to note that while the given plot does not provide a specific antagonist or creature actively trying to prevent the group from flying to safety, the actions of the Governor and the police escort act as significant obstacles in their quest. Additionally, as the group ventures into the restricted area, they may encounter other unforeseen challenges or adversaries that would try to impede their progress and threaten their safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each, and each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and, unlike oxygen and nitrogen gas, reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions combine with calcium ions in the seawater to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of the shells of marine organisms. These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth. On land, carbon is stored in soil as organic carbon as a result of the decomposition of living organisms or from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals. Deeper under the ground, at land and at sea, are fossil fuels, the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A non-renewable resource is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents. Carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. The large number of land animals raised to feed Earth’s growing human population results in increased carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere caused by their respiration.... Q: The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon where? Choices: - before the oceans - in the earth - after the oceans - in the oceans A:","completion":"The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013. answer the following question: What are the names of the performers who were prevented from preforming songs they had submitted?

First, it now appears that we will have to double world food production in the next 40 years due to population growth, increasing meat consumption and pressure from biofuels . We will also have to reduce the environmental impacts from our farming practices, which have caused widespread damage to soils, ecosystems, waters and even the atmosphere. In fact, agriculture's impacts are as bad as climate change as an environmental concern. Besides, we will have to improve food security for the world's poor. While the Green Revolution of the 1960s made it possible to feed hundreds of millions more people than in earlier eras, the number of the under-nourished in the world has started to rise again. Finally, we will have to increase the recovering ability of agriculture from shocks. Today, our high-efficiency, globalized world has many benefits, but it is vulnerable to destruction, whether from droughts, diseases or sudden price rises. We must start building better food systems to better keep us away from future shocks. Currently, there are two models of agriculture: local and organic agriculture vs. globalized and industrialized agriculture. Each has been strongly supported and severely criticized, but neither of these models, standing alone, can fully meet our needs. Organic agriculture teaches us important lessons about soils, nutrition and pest management. Unfortunately, organic food provides less than 1% of the world's calories, mostly to the wealthy. It is hard to imagine organic farming developing to feed 9 billion. Globalized and industrialized agriculture has benefits of high output and low labor demands. Without it, billions of people would have starved. However, it has come with enormous environmental and social costs, which cannot be sustained. Rather than voting for just one solution, we need a third way to solve the crisis. Let's take ideas from both sides, creating new, hybrid solutions that increase production, save resources...

He asked, \\"Why are you beating my horse?\\" \\"It has nothing to do with you, \\" Mr. Baker said angrily. \\"The beast knows why I'm beating him!\\" Question: What was Mr. Baker?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Thomas was born in Woodington, Darke County, Ohio, to Harry and Harriet (nee Wagoner) Thomas. His father was a doctor, his mother a teacher. In 1900, the family moved to the mining town of Victor, Colorado. Thomas worked there as a gold miner, a cook, and a reporter on the newspaper. Thomas's most amusing on-air gaffe occurred during one of his daily broadcasts in the early 1960s. He was reading a story \\"cold\\" (going on the air without pre-reading his copy, contrary to his usual practice) which contained the phrase \\"She suffered a near fatal heart attack\\". The line came out of Thomas's mouth as \\"She suffered a near fart ... err fatal heart attack\\". Realizing instantly what he had said, he tried to continue but eventually collapsed into gales of laughter, which continued into - and beyond - his announcer's chuckling sign-off for the day. Thomas' long-time friend and ghostwriter Prosper Buranelli wrote the nightly newscasts. The day's script was sent by teletype to Thomas' home in Pawling, NY from which he usually did his broadcast. One evening, Buranelli's final story was about an actress going into a Los Angeles hotel with a Great Dane. The dog's tail got caught in the revolving door and she sued the hotel for 10,000. Buranelli added a comment to the story to give Thomas a laugh before going on air, but Thomas read the story as written with Buranelli's comment, \\"Who ever thought a piece of tail was worth 10 grand?\\" Another on-air mishap had Thomas reading a story about President Eisenhower's visit to Hershey, Pennsylvania \\"where he was greeted by the folks who make chocolate bars, with and without nuts.\\" (\\"Nuts\\" is a euphemism for \\"testicles.\\") As Thomas read the next story, he could hear the announcer breaking up with laughter in the New York City studio, which caused Thomas to break up, as well. Air checks of some of Thomas' gaffes (as well as recreations of his \\"bloopers\\") are available to collectors. What is this","completion":"This is a story about a man named Thomas, who was from Ohio and later moved to Colorado where he did different jobs. Then he became a news reporter on the radio and sometimes he would accidentally say funny things on-air. One time, he got mixed up while reading a story and said something that made him and others laugh a lot. He had a friend named Prosper who would write the news stories for him. Once, Prosper wrote a joke in a news story, but Thomas didn't know it was a joke and he read it on the air, which made everyone laugh again. Another time, Thomas said something funny while reading a story about a visit by President Eisenhower and it made everyone in the studio break into laughter as well. People still enjoy listening to these funny moments today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary. We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, \\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\\" I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined. An attached note said \\"I paid this bill in advance. I wasn't sure that I could be there; but, nevertheless, I paid for two plates--one for you and the other for your wife. You w ill never know what that night meant for me. I love you, son.\\" At that moment, I understood the importance of saying in time 'I love YOU' and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve because these things cannot be put off till some \\"other\\" time. It can be inferred from the passage that _ .

This translation takes the original Czech sentence, \\"Ale kosmonaut věděl, jestliže vůbec něco, méně než Norton sám a to nebyl důkaz, že není součástí snu,\\" and converts it into an English translation that maintains the meaning and context of the text. The sentence seems to convey the idea that an astronaut's knowledge or perception of a situation is limited, specifically in comparison to Norton, a character who seems to have a greater understanding of what is happening. Additionally, this knowledge did not serve as evidence that the astronaut was not part of a dream, potentially suggesting an element of uncertainty or unreality surrounding the events being described."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
