At his old Fleet Street lodgings above Mrs. Nellie Lovett's (Helena Bonham Carter) pie shop, he discovers that Lucy, having been raped by Turpin, has poisoned herself, and his teenage daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is now Turpin's ward, and like her mother before her, is the object of his unwanted affections. Nellie has kept Todd's silver barber knives hidden in the Barkers' old room, which is supposedly haunted. Todd vows revenge, reopening his barber shop in the upstairs flat.While roaming London, Anthony spots Johanna and falls in love with her, but is ejected from the Judge's house by Turpin and his associate, Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). Far from being discouraged, the sailor becomes determined that the pair will elope.

Write a question about the following article: Cloud argues, \\"the emblematic moment of the period from 1955 through the 1980s in American labor was the tragic PATCO strike in 1981.\\" Most unions were strongly opposed to Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, despite the fact that Reagan remains the only union leader to become President. On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization union—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a 10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \\"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends.

This House would ban the promotion of diets What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"Introduction: The promotion of diets has become a prevalent aspect of modern society, driven by a media landscape that often glorifies specific body types as the epitome of beauty and well-being. While some diets can be helpful for certain individuals, there is an increasing concern surrounding the negative effects of promoting diets on a large scale, leading to the proposition that this House would ban the promotion of diets. Several arguments can be made in favor of this stance, focusing on topics such as physical health, mental health, individual identity, and social responsibility. Argument 1: Protecting Physical Health One of the primary reasons to consider banning the promotion of diets is to protect people's physical health. Many promoted diets are not scientifically substantiated, and some can even be detrimental to one's health. By banning the promotion of such diets, the House would be ensuring that individuals only receive reliable, evidence-based nutritional advice. For instance, fad diets often promise quick results by drastically cutting calorie intake or eliminating entire food groups, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies, slowed metabolism, and other negative health outcomes. By removing these unsound diets from the public sphere, this House would prevent individuals from potentially damaging their bodies while pursuing unrealistic weight-loss goals. Argument 2: Preserving Mental Health Another significant argument in favor of banning the promotion of diets concerns mental health. The constant exposure to diet promotions can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and pressure to attain often unattainable body types. This can result in negative self-perception and, in some cases, has been linked to the development of eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia. By putting an end to the promotion of diets, the House would create an environment where individuals are less likely to be bombarded with unrealistic body ideals, helping to promote a healthier relationship with one's body and food. Argument 3: Fostering Individual Identity Banning the promotion of diets can also have a positive impact by fostering individual identity and promoting body diversity. The promotion of diets, often accompanied by imagery of slim body types, perpetuates the idea that there is a single \\"ideal\\" body shape that everyone should strive for, which is blatantly incorrect. By contrast, a ban on diet promotions would help emphasize that bodies can be healthy, strong, and beautiful in various shapes and sizes, encouraging individuals to embrace their uniqueness and better understand their own health needs. This can facilitate a healthier, more accepting society where body image is celebrated, rather than dictated by external sources. Argument 4: Encouraging Social Responsibility Finally, the ban on promoting diets can contribute to increased social responsibility for media outlets, influencers, and advertisers. The rampant promotion of diets reflects the prioritization of profit over public health and well-being, as organizations often endorse specific diets or weight-loss products without regard to their potential harm. Banning diet promotions would force these entities to reevaluate their content and advertising strategies. Instead, they would be required to present scientifically-backed, balanced, and inclusive representations of health and nutrition, better serving their audiences and promoting a healthier society. Conclusion: In conclusion, several arguments support the idea that banning the promotion of diets would be beneficial to society at large. Not only would it protect physical and mental health, but it would also help promote the importance of individuality and body diversity while pushing media outlets and advertisers towards greater social responsibility. By implementing this ban, the House would send a strong message that public health and well-being take precedence over short-lived trends and profit-driven promotions."},{"prompt":"Q: Given a sentence with a missing word, pick the answer option that best fills out the missing word in the sentence.

The sentence you provided has the following pieces of information relevant to the question: 1. Joseph Ratzinger was created a cardinal. 2. The event occurred in a small four-appointment consistory. 3. The date of the consistory was 27 June 1977. So from this information, we can infer that Joseph Ratzinger became a cardinal on the exact date mentioned in the question - June 27, 1977. It's important to note that Pope Paul VI was the reigning pope at that time (from 1963 to 1978) and had the authority to create cardinals. Therefore, it is evident that Joseph Ratzinger was made a cardinal by Pope Paul VI on June 27, 1977. Moreover, the sentence also informs us about the inclusion of Bernardin Gantin from Benin, Africa, though the question did not specifically ask for information about other individuals who became cardinals on the same date.

The show delves into the world of hedge funds, revealing how the characters navigate the landscape and deal with the moral and ethical issues that arise. The famous Biggie Smalls' line \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\\" rings true in this thrilling drama, as the primary focus lies on the insatiable appetite for wealth and the problems that come with it. Step 1: Setting the Scene To articulate the world of 'Billions,' it is essential to explore the main characters and plotline. The show revolves around two central figures: Bobby \\"Axe\\" Axelrod, a billionaire hedge fund manager played by Damian Lewis, and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Rhoades Jr., a ruthless U.S. Attorney portrayed by Paul Giamatti. As the characters chase wealth and power, they find themselves in a perpetual cat-and-mouse game that blurs the line between right and wrong. Step 2: More Money Bobby Axelrod is the epitome of the rags-to-riches story, having built his wealth from the ground up after losing his family in the 9/11 attacks. Along with his cunning intelligence and immense wealth, Axe wields enormous influence and charm. However, his ambition for even greater wealth often lands him in precarious situations, drawing the attention of law enforcement agencies like the SEC and Chuck Rhoades. A prime example of Axe's insatiable hunger for wealth is when he resorts to illegal tactics, such as insider trading, to enhance his financial empire. His actions, motivated by greed and the drive for more money, lead to strained relationships and greater scrutiny from the authorities. Step 3: More Problems As Bobby's wealth and power grow, so do his problems. He faces constant threats from rival hedge fund managers and other powerful forces seeking to bring him down. Simultaneously, his actions attract the attention of Chuck Rhoades, who seeks to dismantle Axe's empire and establish himself as a champion of justice. The subsequent legal battles, betrayals, and public scrutiny cause major disruptions in both the professional and personal lives of the show's characters. For Chuck Rhoades, his relentless pursuit of justice often borders on obsession, blurring the line between professionalism and personal vendetta. This quest for moral high ground starts to affect his relationships at work and his personal life, with his marriage to Wendy Rhoades, who happens to be Axe's trusted performance coach, a significant source of tension. Step 4: The Price of Wealth The central theme of 'Billions' demonstrates the potential consequences when the pursuit of money and power knows no bounds. As the characters topple over ethical lines and embrace every opportunity to accumulate more wealth, their problems grow in tandem. The show offers viewers an insightful look into the moral sacrifices and psychological ramifications that the characters face as a result of their actions in pursuit of billions. Conclusion: In conclusion, 'Billions' is an electrifying series that offers a compelling exploration of the high-stakes world of finance, the lengths people will go to achieve wealth, and the problems that inevitably arise due to their insatiable appetites. As the show continues to enthrall audiences, it serves as a poignant reminder of the words of Biggie Smalls: \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide. Is it true that calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene?","completion":"Yes, it is true that calcium carbide (CaC2) is the raw material for the production of acetylene. Calcium carbide is one of the most important and commonly used industrial raw materials and has extremely diverse applications due to the potential chemical reactions it can undergo. Calcium carbide is made by heating a mixture of lime (calcium oxide) and carbon (usually derived from coke or anthracite coal) in an electric arc furnace to temperatures around 2000–2200 °C. During this process, the carbon reacts with the limestone to form calcium carbide. The acetylene gas is produced by adding water to calcium carbide. When water is mixed with calcium carbide, the following chemical reaction occurs: CaC2 + 2H2O → C2H2 (acetylene) + Ca(OH)2 The product of this reaction consists of acetylene gas, an important industrial chemical, and calcium hydroxide as a byproduct. The generated acetylene gas can be collected, purified, and used in numerous applications. Acetylene has several important uses in industry due to its highly reactive nature, which forms the basis of flame welding and cutting processes. The gas burns at a temperature hot enough to melt and fuse metals, allowing it to be used in welding steel, cutting processes, and metallurgical applications. Further, it serves as a raw material for the synthesis of a variety of organic chemicals like chloroprene and vinyl chloride, used extensively in the manufacturing of synthetic rubbers and plastics. Another application of calcium carbide includes the production of calcium cyanamide (CaCN2) through the reaction with nitrogen gas at high temperatures in an electric arc furnace. Calcium cyanamide is an essential ingredient in fertilizers due to its ability to provide nitrogen to plants, and thus plays a vital role in agriculture. Calcium carbide also finds use in steelmaking as a powerful desulfurizing agent, removing sulfur impurities from molten steel, ensuring the production of high-quality steel with improved mechanical properties. In conclusion, calcium carbide (CaC2) is a crucial raw material in the production of acetylene. Its role in producing this versatile gas, and its numerous other applications, make it a vital compound for various industries ranging from welding, metallurgy, and chemical production to agriculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The film opens at Burger-Matic, where Henry Lever orders a milkshake at the drive-thru. At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death. They quickly deduce that Burger-Matic is the only location close enough to have been on the same frequency. Angus goads Dorian into getting a job there to ensure that no one is wise to their crime.

He worked for twenty years and during those twenty years, he felt that his life was boring. Every day, he studied the weather and tried to predict the next day's weather. Then, he stood in front of the camera and read his report. Some days it was cloudy, some days it was sunny; sometimes rainy, while sometimes snowy. The weather changed each day, but Bob still felt that his job was always the same. His boss often told him to be happier and smile more in front of the camera, but Bob rarely smiled. He thought that most people did not watch his weather report and his job did not matter much to anyone. One day, he arrived at work and began to study the weather as usual. He noticed that something was different that day. Everything he studied told him that there was going to be a very big storm very soon, though he was not completely sure. Suddenly, Bob felt excited. He ran to his boss's office and asked to do a special weather report. The boss agreed and Bob gave a special report that afternoon, warning people of the coming storm. Because of this report, many people were safe during the storm. Bob realized that his job was actually very important. Question: How did Bob realize that his job was actually very important?

Those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning, packing or bottling and stacking shelves. Job shortage: A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal. The research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts. It shows many are emerging into a hugely competitive job market where they may wait years before securing meaningful employment. The trebling of tuition fees last year to a maximum of £9,000 has created the prospect of thousands of students leaving university in two years with debts of £40,000 or more once living costs are added - and no prospect of starting to pay it off for the foreseeable future. Details were released at the same time as a Confederation of British Industry report warned too many sixth formers were being pushed into the ‘default’ university route instead of considering vocational courses and on-the-job training. Key industries such as manufacturing, construction, IT and engineering face a recruitment crisis as a result, it said. Of the 190,000 full-time first degree leavers in 2011-2012 who took part in the HESA survey, more than 17 per cent said they had continued studying. Two-thirds said they were working - but barely more than half were on permanent contracts.Six per cent said they had taken basic, unskilled work such as manning rubbish trucks or sorting mail. Two per cent were doing internships, 1.3 per cent were involved in voluntary work and 2.7 per cent classified themselves as other/unknown, a category which includes ‘developing a portfolio’. Another five per cent had opted to travel or do ‘something else’. Opportunities for university leavers. have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by. the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month. Crisis: Opportunities for university leavers have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month. Banking and finance has seen 45 per cent of jobs evaporate, while accountancy and professional services firms have 17 per cent fewer vacancies. At the same time the pay premium gained from higher education is being eroded, creating a double whammy for graduates. Twenty years ago they earned 52 per cent more on average than workers with lower or no qualifications. Now that is down to 27 per cent. National Union of Students president Toni Pearce said: ‘Many of those entering the work-place for the first time are finding it hard to find a job that matches their skills. ‘Those taking their first step on the career ladder are willing to work hard and pay their dues but employers must stop exploiting them through things like unpaid internships.’ The CBI report called for a university admissions-style system to be set up to help more young people apply for apprenticeships and vocational courses. This is needed to prevent a chronic shortage of suitable workers as it estimated the majority of posts created between now and 2020 will be in high-skilled jobs. ‘What is now seen as the “default route” of an undergraduate degree is not suitable for all - young people have different talents and learn in different ways,’ the report said. ‘We should aim to inspire but also be realistic, setting out the costs and likely return on options open to young people, including the vocational options that have long been undersold.’ Policy director Katja Hall added: ‘We need to tackle the perception that the A-levels and three-year degree model is the only route to a good career. ‘When faced with a £27,000 debt, young people are already becoming much savvier in shopping around for routes to give them a competitive edge in a tighter job market.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Pearly queen: The Pearl of Asia - the largest pearl in the world, once part of the crown jewels of the Moghul empire - is on display at the V&A. A parasitic invertebrate that has just been pooed out by a shark is hardly the place you'd go to find that classy necklace. But experts have scuppered the popular belief that pearls form through friction with a grain of sand - saying that they actually build around tapeworm larvae. The revelation, which might have surprised fans of the beads such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, comes as part of a new exhibition at the V&A in London. A video demonstrating how the precious stones form when tapeworm larvae excreted by sharks and stingrays become trapped in water-filtering shellfish such as oysters will be on show at the museum's Pearls exhibition, which begins on Saturday. The show's co-creator, Hubert Bari, said:. 'The people marketing (pearls) prefer to say, \\"It is so fantastic, your. necklace was made from a grain of sand\\". 'It is better to speak about a grain of sand than to speak about a piece of s*** from a stingray.' The somewhat unsavoury origins of the. pearl have been known since 1852, when Filippi of Turin proved that a. parasitic flatworm called the Distomum duplicatum was the cause of the. stones forming inside freshwater mussels. ...and here's the little guy who made it: The larvae of a tapeworm, which gets into shellfish and causes them to excrete a substance that forms into a pearl. Precious: An Akoya pearl necklace, previously owned by Marilyn Monroe, which is one of the items in the V&A exhibition. The tapeworm had its crucial role in pearl formation acknowledged in a 1903 paper by Professors Herdman and Hornell on pearl fisheries in Ceylon. Pearls can form around any parasite -. including fish and snails - that has drilled into the the flesh of sea. creatures such as mussels, but tapeworms and flatworms that have been. excreted by larger animals are the most common invaders. The. immune system of the shellfish then fights the worm by surrounding them. with layer upon layer of nacre - a calcium-based material that makes up. their shells - causing the parasite to suffocate and become trapped in. this solid casing. Wealth: The Roseberry Pearl and Diamond Tiara that was given to Hannah De Rothschild as a wedding present in 1878. Ancient and modern: The Pearl Pendant Earrings (top) and Ring (centre) once owned by Hollywood film star Elizabeth Taylor, left, and right, the Hope pearl, which was previously owned by King Louis XIV of France. Oysters, which produce a milky nacre, are the most common source for commercial pearls, but other animals can produce pearls that are black, blue, red or green, depending on the natural colour of their nacre. Pearls are most abundant where ecosystems thrive from larger predators through to the parasites and their hosts. The V&A exhibition explores the history of pearls, chronicling how the jewels went from being a luxury. adored by royalty (Queen Victoria loved pearls so much she had. Garrard’s create black pearl jewellery when she was in mourning) to. objets d’art, by jewellers such as Vietnamese Sam Tho Duong, and a. mass-produced product worn by fashionistas and aristos alike. Aristocracy: The Lady Raine Spencer tiara, owned by the stepmother to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Fit for a princess: The Hanover tiara, worn by both wives of Prince Johann Georg of Saxony. I. Natural: The exhibition opens on Saturday and includes historical displays and features about the science of pearls. It goes back to the invention of the cultured pearl and how Kokichi Mikimoto produced it on an industrial scale in Japan. Marilyn Monroe wore a 16in string of Mikimoto pearls to court the day she divorced her second husband Joe DiMaggio in 1954. After the war, the Hollywood hits of the 1940s and the 1950s generated a feelgood factor and a style that was desired – if not affordable for ordinary Americans. Doris Day, Lauren Bacall and Ava Gardner were among the actresses who wore pearl chokers made up of cultured pearls – they gradually started to take over from natural pearls. For centuries, pearls had been a sign of extreme wealth. Finding. one usually required a diver to open 2,000 oysters, – but Mikimoto, who. headed the company which made Monroe’s necklace, pioneered the. commercial ‘culturing’ of pearls, where irritants were deliberately. introduced to oysters to farm jewellery. Mikimoto said he wanted to ‘adorn the necks of all women around the world with pearls’. The new exhibition at the V&A in London features jewellery from Elizabeth Taylor's (left). The Duchess of Cambridge (right) with a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden. History went full circle when Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, wore a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden, to the celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The exhibition also features Liz. Taylor’s stunning Bulgari pendant earrings, a pearl-drop earring worn by. Charles I at his execution in 1649, a brooch given as a sentimental. gift to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert and a sparkling collection of. tiaras, including one with pearls ‘the size of walnuts’ made for the. wedding of Hannah de Rothschild who in the 1870s was the wealthiest. woman in England. Much of the show focuses on rare, natural pearls from the Arabian Gulf. Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy (pictured with son John Jr) and Princess Diana. Elizabeth Taylor's Bulgari pendant earrings: 'To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday,' said co-curator Beatriz Chadour-Sampson. ‘Qatar and the other Gulf states have money and they want to buy their heritage back,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘They now own Elizabeth Taylor’s pendant earrings and many other pieces including an eye-popping 1930s Cartier five-strand graduated pearl necklace. 'If you think that you need thousands of oysters to find a pearl it’s no surprise they have been seen as objects of desire through the ages.’ The Romans wore pearls as items of sheer luxury, while in medieval times they became a Christian symbol for purity and chastity, and then in the Renaissance symbols of authority and wealth. They were even felt to have medicinal. properties – philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon is said to have. taken crushed pearls mixed with lemon juice as an elixir. ‘Pearls are still given at weddings today and have an association with joy,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘But. at the same time they are directly associated with death. The classical. belief that pearls were created from the teardrops of the gods links. them with sadness and tears.’ Marvel: Visitors will be able to look at exhibits such as the Roseberry Pearl and Diamond Tiara. Rich and famous: Marilyn Monroe with Joe DiMaggio wearing her Mikimoto necklace, one of the few pieces of fine jewellery she actually owned, and Lady Rosebery's tiara (right), 1878. Their cachet has continued into the age of Hollywood and celebrity, helped by the rise of cultivated and imitation pearls. Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy and Princess Diana. ‘What fascinated me is the variety of pearls, the international trade and the worldwide obsession,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘Rubies and emeralds have been fashionable at certain times, and even diamonds go in and out of favour, but the appeal of pearls appears to have been continuous through all jewellery history.’ Pearls is at the V&A (in partnership with the Qatar Museums Authority), Sept 21-Jan 19. ‘A five-string graduated natural Gulf pearl necklace made by Cartier in the 1930s. He sourced his pearls directly in the Gulf that were then mounted in Paris. This really embodies the endurance of the divers and the rarity of the pearls.’ ‘Worn by Charles I when he was beheaded in 1649. It’s very difficult to authenticate these things, but in this case the family has a note saying what this pearl is and it’s written in the hand of Queen Mary II, his granddaughter.’ ‘George III, who was normally known for his restraint, dressed to dazzle with jewels at festive events and is recorded as having a special interest in buttons and button-making.’ ‘A wedding present when Hannah de Rothschild, the richest woman in England, married a wealthy young politician, Archibald, 5th earl of Rosebery. She died 12 years later and Rosebery then presented it to his daughter-in-law. The New York Times described the pearls in the tiara as being as big as walnuts.’ ‘Necklace given to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio on their honeymoon. It was bought in Japan directly from Mikimoto, so the quality is very good.’ ‘A heart-shaped openwork gold brooch given to Victoria by Prince Albert in 1843 on their third wedding anniversary. It’s surmounted by a crown with four Scottish freshwater pearls from the River Tay.’ ‘Liz Taylor was crazy about jewellery, and even wrote a book, My Love Affair with Jewellery. To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday.’ ‘The Abernethy pearl is the largest Scottish river pearl ever found – it was found in the 1960s. River pearls tend to be smaller than saltwater pearls.’","completion":"The Pearl of Asia, the largest pearl in the world, which was once part of the crown jewels of the Moghul empire, is on display at the V&A museum in London.

The exhibition heavily focuses on rare, natural pearls from the Arabian Gulf, and also includes examples from significant figures throughout history. The enduring appeal of pearls is evident, with the Duchess of Cambridge's recent appearance in drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden at the celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The Pearls exhibition, in partnership with the Qatar Museums Authority, aims to highlight the beauty, history, and significance of these precious gems, dispelling myths and sharing the fascinating facts behind their creation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact 1: Sweat is used for adjusting to hot temperatures by some animals. Fact 2: All humans are animals. Given the two facts above, what uses sweat to adjust to hot temperatures?","completion":"Given the two facts mentioned: Fact 1 being that sweat is used for adjusting to hot temperatures by some animals, and Fact 2 stating that all humans are animals, we can infer that humans, as a part of the animal kingdom, use sweat as a mechanism to adjust to hot temperatures. Sweat, which is primarily composed of water, salt, and trace amounts of other minerals, is produced by the body through the eccrine glands. These glands are distributed across the majority of the human body's surface area, predominantly found on the forehead, soles of the feet, palms of the hands, and the chest. When the body's core temperature rises due to factors such as hot weather, physical exercise, or emotional stress, the autonomic nervous system triggers the eccrine glands to release sweat. As the sweat is excreted onto the skin and exposed to the air, it evaporates, producing a cooling effect on the body's surface. This process helps to regulate body temperature and maintain it within an optimal range, usually around 98.6°F (37°C). By dissipating excess heat, sweating prevents the body from overheating, which is crucial for the proper functioning of internal organs and various biochemical processes necessary for survival. Among other animals, different species have evolved distinct strategies to cope with hot temperatures. While some animals, such as dogs and birds, rely predominantly on panting (i.e., rapid, shallow breathing) to cool down, other mammals like elephants and horses also utilize sweat glands to regulate their body temperature. The use of sweat glands is more common in mammals, whereas most birds, reptiles, and amphibians rely on alternate cooling mechanisms. In conclusion, given the facts provided, humans use sweat as a primary means of adjusting to hot temperatures, consistent with their nature as animals. This process is enabled by the eccrine glands that are distributed across the body, which secrete sweat onto the skin to successfully facilitate temperature regulation. Similar adaptations can also be observed in certain other mammal species, highlighting the importance of thermoregulation mechanisms across the animal kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The event brought together various countries and international organizations to pledge financial and technical support for rebuilding Iraq's economy and infrastructure. The conference aimed to address the numerous challenges faced by Iraq, such as political instability, security threats, and a struggling economy. During the conference, several key economic reconstruction pledges were made to support Iraq's recovery process. These commitments aimed to boost the nation's economy, improve public services, foster a conducive environment for private sector development, and promote sustainable growth in the long run. 1. Financial assistance: Donor countries and organizations pledged billions of dollars in grants and loans, which were crucial for immediate post-war reconstruction efforts. The United States pledged 20 billion, with other countries and international organizations pledging an additional 13 billion to support infrastructure projects, social services, and economic development. 2. Debt relief: Iraq's heavy debt burden, accumulated during the rule of Saddam Hussein, created an impediment to its economic progress. Several creditor countries, particularly members of the Paris Club, agreed to provide substantial debt relief for Iraq, reducing the burden and allowing the country to invest in growth and human development. 3. Technical assistance: International organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Nations pledged support in providing technical expertise to help Iraq rebuild its institutional capacity, develop sound economic policies, and improve governance and public administration. 4. Private sector development: Encouraging private sector growth plays a crucial role in the country's long-term economic recovery. Participants at the Madrid Conference acknowledged the importance of supporting private businesses and entrepreneurs through policy reforms, infrastructure investments, and access to finance. 5. Job creation and human development: A significant focus at the Madrid Conference was the need to create jobs and promote human development in Iraq. Hence, several pledges were made to invest in education, healthcare, and social programs, aiming to enhance the skill level of Iraq's workforce and improve the overall welfare of the population. In conclusion, the Madrid Conference played a pivotal role in laying the foundation for Iraq's post-war economic reconstruction. The pledges made during the conference sought to address various aspects of the country's recovery, including financial assistance, debt relief, technical expertise, private sector development, and human development investments. These commitments reflected the international community's collective efforts in stabilizing and revitalizing the Iraqi economy, supporting long-term growth, and improving the lives of its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Option 1: starts using a large ax on the sides of some bushes. - This option could fit as it provides a logical continuation of the man being in his front yard, assuming he wants to trim the bushes. Option 2: is holding a bow and arrow. - This option seems out of place, as there is no clear connection between the man standing in his front yard and using a bow and arrow. Option 3: is using a leaf blower attached to his back. - This option is also a potential fit, as using a leaf blower in a front yard is a common activity for yard maintenance. Option 4: puts out a piece of paper and begins to scrape up the leaves and dirt in front of him. - This option is less plausible. Typically, one would use a rake or other yard tool, rather than a piece of paper, to clean up leaves and dirt.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: How could being someones taxi for the day while they run errands be good for the world? Possible A: gain, supplies, helpful, help people, add to Why is \\"help people\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Help people\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense because it inherently captures the essence of empathy, community support, and human connection. The act of being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands showcases a sense of personal investment and care for the well-being of others, which is a fundamental aspect of human nature. This detailed explanation will cover various aspects such as emotional intelligence, social responsibility, environmental impact, and potential ripple effects of this helpful act. 1. Emotional Intelligence: Helping others is a quintessential example of emotional intelligence, which includes the ability to understand, interpret, and manage our own emotions and those of others. By assisting someone in their daily errands, the person providing the taxi service demonstrates empathy and has the capacity to put themselves in the other person's shoes. This selflessness and compassionate behavior are not only appreciated but also aligned with human common sense values. 2. Social Responsibility: Being a helpful member of society is to acknowledge that we exist within a network of individuals, each with complementary strengths and needs. By offering assistance to someone who may not have the means or ability to run their errands efficiently, one actively contributes to the well-being of society as a whole. This sense of social responsibility is ingrained in most humans, making \\"help people\\" a common-sense answer. 3. Environmental Impact: Although this may not be the primary reason for why \\"help people\\" is aligned with human common sense, there are potential indirect environmental benefits to providing taxi services to someone. Consolidating trips and carpooling reduces individual car usage, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduced road congestion. This positive environmental impact further solidifies the choice to help as a sensible and responsible decision. 4. Ripple Effects: Another reason \\"help people\\" is regarded as a common-sense answer is due to the potential ripple effects it may create. Kindness and assistance often inspire recipients to pass on the generosity to others, causing a chain reaction of benevolence. This virtuous cycle may reinforce a sense of community and belonging, ultimately creating a better and more connected world. In conclusion, the answer \\"help people\\" aligns with human common sense because it encompasses emotional intelligence, social responsibility, environmental impact, and potential positive ripple effects. These elements combine to represent the fundamental values and instincts that drive humans to be helpful and mutually supportive members of society. By offering transportation assistance to someone in need, one becomes a valuable part of a collective effort to foster compassion, understanding, and progress in this interconnected world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, it is not possible to affirm that every politician loves to help their people and do the right thing. a). yes - This answer is incorrect because it generalizes all politicians, which doesn't account for the diversity of motivations and actions among them. b). it is not possible to tell - This answer might seem tempting, but choosing this option would imply a lack of understanding of the varied nature of politicians.

How to increase urine flow Visit your doctor for a prostate exam after age 50. The prostate is a gland in men that sits low in the abdomen, and when it gets enlarged it squeezes the urethra. This causes slow flow, difficulty starting to urinate, dribbling, and a weak stream. Possible answers: [i] Follow your doctor's instructions regarding how to be prepared. For women, a typical menstrual cycle generally lasts about 40 days. [ii] All of these conditions may lead to an enlarged prostate, especially when you are urinating. If this is the case, go to your doctor and have them measure the fluid in your urine. [iii] Notice if you have any previous painful semen or pain. These symptoms can indicate that you may have an urinary tract infection or have another medical issue. [iv] It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 60. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or bph, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. Answer:","completion":"[iv] It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 60. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. In order to increase urine flow and alleviate the symptoms of BPH, it's essential to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and follow specific recommendations tailored to your needs. Some potential solutions may include: 1. Medications: Your doctor might prescribe medications such as alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin) to relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, allowing for better urine flow. Another class of drugs, called 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride), may be used to shrink the size of the prostate, leading to improved urine flow over time. 2. Minimize irritants: Caffeine, alcohol, and acidic or spicy foods can irritate the bladder and worsen urinary symptoms. Reducing the consumption of these irritants might help increase urine flow. 3. Stay well-hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to promote healthy urinary system function and prevent dehydration. Aim for approximately 6-8 glasses of water daily, although specific needs may vary depending on your activity level and overall health. 4. Double-voiding technique: After urinating, wait for a moment before trying to urinate again. This can help ensure that your bladder is completely empty, which may help increase urine flow over time. 5. Pelvic floor exercises: Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles can help improve bladder control and alleviate some urinary symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate. 6. Maintain a healthy weight: Excessive weight can put pressure on the bladder and contribute to urinary problems. Eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 7. Minimize stress: Stress can directly affect bladder function and exacerbate urinary symptoms. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, can help manage stress levels. 8. Timed voiding: Set a schedule for regular bathroom breaks, regardless of whether you feel the urge to urinate. This will help train your bladder to empty at specific intervals, thereby potentially increasing urine flow. If your symptoms are severe or do not improve with lifestyle changes and medications, your doctor may suggest more invasive treatments, such as surgery or minimally invasive procedures (e.g., Urolift®). It is crucial to have open communication with your healthcare provider and discuss the best approach to manage your enlarged prostate and improve urine flow."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet. pick from the following. A). negative B). positive","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be categorized as B) positive. Here's an in-depth analysis of the tweet to justify the classification: 1. The use of informal language and tone: The author employs a casual and friendly tone, which is indicative of a positive and non-serious sentiment. The usage of words such as \\"Ok,\\" \\"friends,\\" \\"pleease\\" suggest a light-hearted, informal approach. 2. Mention of pre-existing relationships: The tweet is specifically directed at friends in the area, implying that there is a sense of familiarity and camaraderie among the people involved. The reference to friends usually evokes positive sentiment, as it suggests mutual trust, rapport, and understanding. 3. Presentation of a need/problem: The author mentions the need for a place to engage in intimate activities, and the fact that their current living situation (living with a parent) is not suitable for this purpose. By presenting a personal problem, they invite sympathy or understanding from their friends, which demonstrates a more positive-seeking sentiment than a negative one. 4. Use of humor/self-deprecation: The author acknowledges that their sex life is currently non-existent, which establishes a humorous self-deprecating tone. Self-deprecating humor serves as a way to convey vulnerability and create a positive atmosphere, without making the statement sound like a complaint or a burden to others. 5. Request for assistance: The ultimate goal of this tweet is to seek help from friends, rather than to express dissatisfaction or negativity. The author is reaching out for support and expecting kindness from their friends, which contributes to an overall positive sentiment. Taking these factors into account, it's clear that the sentiment of this tweet falls more in the positive category, as it displays humor, camaraderie, vulnerability, and a hope for support from friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language of the sentence you provided, \\"Ale to sauver sa peau ho udrží v plné přeměně, dokonce I po smrti\\" is a mixture of different languages: Czech, French, and Slovak. These three languages belong to different groups of the Indo-European family. Let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"Ale to\\" - This is Czech and Slovak. In Czech, it means \\"but it\\". Similarly, in Slovak, it translates to \\"but the\\". 2. \\"sauver sa peau\\" - This is a French phrase which literally translates to \\"save his skin\\". It's an idiomatic expression equivalent to the English phrase \\"save one's own neck\\", meaning to escape from a dangerous or difficult situation. 3. \\"ho udrží v plné přeměně\\" - This phrase appears Czech, where \\"ho udrží\\" translates to \\"it keeps him\\" and \\"v plné přeměně\\" translates to \\"in full metamorphosis\\". 4. \\"dokonce i po smrti\\" - This final phrase is again Czech, which translates to English as \\"even after death\\". In conclusion, while the sentence consists predominantly of Czech, elements of French and possibly Slovak are present as well. The analysis, however, is complicated by the fact the sentence doesn't seem to be properly structured in any of these languages, and the use of these languages interchangeably in a single sentence is unusual. The translation would be roughly equivalent to: \\"But it saves his skin, it keeps him in full transformation, even after death.\\" Please note, due to the mixed nature of the languages and the sentence's presentation, it could involve some sort of idiom or vernacular phrase that could alter its intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elaine Thompson was the first female to win gold in both the 100m and 200m since which track star of the 1980s?","completion":"Yes, I can help you with that question. Elaine Thompson, a Jamaican sprinter, won gold medals in both the 100 meters and 200 meters during the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games. She became the first woman to achieve this incredible feat since Florence Griffith-Joyner, better known as Flo-Jo. Florence Griffith-Joyner was an American track and field athlete who dominated the events in the 1980s. Born on December 21, 1959, in Los Angeles, California, Flo-Jo rose to fame and solidified her status as an unstoppable force in women's athletics. Her remarkable ability to triumph in both short-distance sprints contributed to her success during her athletic career. Flo-Jo's groundbreaking accomplishment transpired during the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, where she made history by securing gold medals in both the 100 meters and 200 meters races. This incredible performance was accompanied by world records that are still unbeaten to this day; she completed the 100 meters race in 10.49 seconds and the 200 meters race in 21.34 seconds. Alongside her individual victories, Flo-Jo also played a role in the United States' successful bid to win the 4x100 meters relay, which crowned her with a third gold medal. She additionally took home a silver medal in the 4x400 meters relay. Regarded as one of the fastest women in the world, Florence Griffith-Joyner's widespread influence and legacy was further expanded upon in 2016 when Elaine Thompson achieved a similar level of success.

Article: Greenwich is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time. Question: Charles made John Flamsteed try to find _ .

Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Talk radio. Yes or no? Answer: While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts . Question: when did talk radio begin in the U.S.? Answer:","completion":"Talk radio, as a format, has its roots in the early days of radio broadcasting in the United States. However, it wasn't until the 1940s and 1950s that the format began to take shape as we recognize it today. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Golden Age of Radio, radio broadcasting was largely characterized by live musical performances, comedy, drama, and news programs. During this time, the idea of individuals expressing their opinions and engaging in discussions on air was not a significant element of radio programming. It was in the 1940s that several factors contributed to the rise of talk radio as a format. First, the development of technology, like the advent of magnetic tape, allowed for easier recording, editing, and playback of radio content. This gave broadcasters the ability to create pre-recorded interviews and discussion programs, making it less difficult to include talk-based content in radio programming schedules. Second, the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision to end its \\"Mayflower Doctrine\\" in 1949 led to a more open environment for political discussion on the radio. The Mayflower Doctrine had essentially prohibited radio stations from editorializing in their news coverage and expressing political opinions. With the end of this policy, radio stations became free to engage in political debates and commentary, laying the groundwork for talk radio as we know it today. Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, the popularity of talk radio began to grow, with a number of local radio stations starting to experiment with this format. One notable early talk radio show was \\"Open Mic\\" hosted by Barry Gray in 1945 at New York City's WMCA. Talk radio continued to expand during the 1950s and 1960s with shows hosted by personalities like Joe Pyne, David Susskind, and Long John Nebel. The 1970s saw the development and popularization of syndicated radio talk shows. This meant that pre-recorded talk radio programs were distributed to multiple radio stations across the country, allowing for a larger audience reach. The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, which had required equal time for opposing points of view on controversial topics, led to further growth of talk radio. This allowed for the emergence of politically-oriented talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh, who began his nationally syndicated show in 1988. In conclusion, although there isn't an exact date when talk radio officially began in the U.S., it can be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s when radio stations began experimenting with talk-based content. The development of new technology and changes in FCC regulations paved the way for the format to grow, ultimately leading to its modern form that continues to be popular today."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process after cells are killed is the activation of the immune system to eliminate the bacteria and repair the damage caused by the bacterial infection. Here's an overview of the process: 1. Bacteria enters the body: Bacteria can enter the body through various routes like a break in the skin, inhalation, ingestion, or contact with mucous membranes. 2. Bloodstream: Bacteria can travel through the bloodstream and reach virtually any part of the body. In some cases, bacteria can also produce harmful toxins that can be carried by the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked: Bacteria can attack various types of cells in the body, either directly or by hijacking resources like nutrients and oxygen to multiply. 4. Cells are killed: As bacteria multiply and infiltrate tissues, they can damage and ultimately kill cells. The damage caused to the cells and tissues may lead to inflammation, tissue destruction, and organ dysfunction. Final step: Activation of the immune system - After cells are killed, the immune system kicks in to fight off the bacterial infection. Components of the immune system, like white blood cells (WBCs), recognize and respond to the presence of foreign invaders (bacteria). - The immune system initiates both an innate immune response (non-specific defenses like phagocytosis) and an adaptive immune response (targeted antibody production) to neutralize and eliminate bacteria and their toxic byproducts. - This immune response may involve inflammation and fever, as well as other symptoms that aid in fighting the infection. - Once the bacteria have been neutralized, the immune system also initiates tissue repair and healing processes to restore the affected area to its normal function. It's important to note that this is a simplified overview of a complex biological process. In some cases, the immune system might be weakened or unable to clear the bacterial infection, which could require medical treatment such as antibiotics to support the immune response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: What little there was, started with Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785–89). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Laboustre's Neo-Grec of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France. What is the answer to this question: How concerned was France with Greek architecture?","completion":"In the context of the article, French concern with Greek architecture was limited during the periods described. While the French did show interest in emulating Greek architectural principles, the adaptation of actual Greek architecture was less of a priority for them, particularly due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines. In the late 18th century, there were only a few examples of buildings influenced by Greek architecture in France, such as Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80) and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785–89). These examples indicate that Greek-inspired architecture was not at the forefront of French architectural design during this era. The French approach to Greek architecture changed from simply emulating the principles of Greek architecture to incorporating more explicit elements of Greek style only during the second French Empire under the influence of Laboustre's Neo-Grec. However, this period of renewed interest in Greek architecture was fleeting. Moreover, the French were more focused on Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines, which sought to understand and apply the underlying principles of Greek architecture rather than strictly adhering to their specific practices. This focus on the essence of Greek architecture, rather than directly mimicking their architectural styles, indicates that the French were more concerned with the philosophical aspects of Greek architecture than its physical representations. In conclusion, France's concern with Greek architecture was relatively subdued. While there were instances of French architects incorporating Greek elements into their works, the more significant influence came from Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to determine and apply the principles of Greek architecture. France's interest in physically replicating Greek architectural styles only emerged briefly during Laboustre's Neo-Grec in the second Empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You'll generally want to make sure whatever environment you're using includes the following: GCC (the Gnu compiler). If you're using Windows, you can install it in Cygwin or MinGW. Binutils is a collection of tools used for manipulating object files. Again, if you're using Windows, you can install it in Cygwin. A good text editor. Vim and emacs are commonly used in UNIX environments. Windows users can use Notepad, or check out Notepad++ for a multi-tab upgrade. Perl and/or Python. One or both are recommended for string manipulation. Writing an operating system means you'll likely be creating hundreds (or thousands!) of lines of code. When you're working on revisions, this can get confusing. Some options to check out are CVS, Mercurial, and Subversion. If you don't want to create your own, you can use an existing one like Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB). If you do feel daring enough to code a bootloader, check out Rolling Your Own Bootloader on OSDev.org. The kernel is the core of your operating system, providing an interface between the user and the computer hardware. There are monolithic kernels and micro kernels. Monolithic kernels implement all the services in the kernel, while microkernels have a small kernel combined with user daemons implementing services. In general, monolithic kernels are faster, but microkernels have better fault isolation and reliability. Begin with small things such as displaying text and interrupts before moving on to things such as memory management and multitasking. You can also try making a simple 16-bit Operating System, instead of taking a big leap. You will not have a full system in two weeks. Start with an OS that boots, then move on to the cool stuff. Rather than rebooting your computer each time you make changes or having to transfer the files from your development computer to your test machine, use a virtual machine application. VMWare is a common option that works with both Windows and Linux, and so is Bochs. Check for potential deadlocks and other bugs and repair them as needed. \\" You can do this by uploading your tested code to your public repository. This will allow people to test your operating system and report back on any issues they run into. There's an entire community of operating system developers congregating on various forums, including /r/osdev on Reddit and the Software Engineering Stack Exchange. One you've gotten a grasp on developing a basic operating system, read existing posts to see what kind of things come up during the development process. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides an in-depth guide into creating an operating system (OS) from scratch. It offers advice on choosing a platform for development, with Windows and Unix-based systems being the most common, and suggests installing a Unix environment like Cygwin or MinGW for coding on Windows systems. The article lists key tools such as GCC, Binutils, text editors, and programming languages Perl or Python as essential for the process, alongside version control programs like CVS, Mercurial, or Subversion to manage multiple versions of code. It talks about the decision of using an existing bootloader or coding a new one using resources such as OSDev.org, and the difference between monolithic and microkernels. The author suggests starting small, learning to create an OS that simply boots, before progressing to more complex functions. The use of a virtual machine, such as VMWare or Bochs, is recommended for testing changes without constant rebooting. Additionally, regular checks for deadlocks and other bugs, and uploading code to a public repository for collaborative troubleshooting, are encouraged. Towards the end, the article highlights the importance of participating in developer communities like /r/osdev on Reddit and the Software Engineering Stack Exchange, to learn from shared issues and solutions within the OS development process."},{"prompt":"Pick your answer from: A). learn the music; B).

Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud.

Bio: martin riz -lrb- born september 16 , 1980 -rrb- is an italian ski mountaineer . A:","completion":"From the provided bio, we can extract several key details about Martin Riz: 1. Name: The individual's full name is Martin Riz. This could provide information on his possible Italian, or another nationality as names can be indicative of cultural or national origin. 2. Birth Date: Martin Riz was born on September 16, 1980. Knowing his birth date allows us to determine his age, which would be crucial when discussing career length or period of activity. As of 2022, this would make him 41 years old. 3. Nationality: Martin Riz is explicitly identified as an Italian. From this, we can infer that he is either born in Italy, has Italian heritage, or both. Nationality may also affect his training landscape and opportunities, skiing culture he grew up with, and could influence the types of competitions he has access to or prominence in. 4. Profession/Activity: The biography states that Martin Riz is a ski mountaineer. This specifies not only the broader category of 'skiing' but further narrow the field to mountaineering which involves climbing mountains often with special equipment and methodologies that might be separate from traditional or cross-country skiing. This would indicate a high level of physical fitness, technical skill, and potentially an interest or background in outdoor and high-altitude activities. It could also indicate participation in specific competitions or events catered to ski mountaineering sports and related disciplines. Therefore, based on these details, we are dealing with an experienced and probably accomplished ski mountaineer who was born in Italy (or of Italian descent) in 1980. His career choice may reflect his Italian origins, potentially influenced by the country's geographical features, notably the presence of the Alps and the Apennines, which are popular for winter sports. This basic information may serve as a foundation for further investigation into Martin Riz's life though more information would be needed to provide further detail, including elements like career milestones, notable achievements, personal life, etc."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: salt, checkers, shopping mall, old west, meat store Why is \\"old west\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Old West\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to a historical period and geographical location where general stores were prevalent, and the items mentioned - whiskey, grain, and saddles - were common goods during that time. The Old West, also known as the American Wild West or the Western Frontier, was a period in American history during the 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by the westward expansion of European settlers. It mostly took place in the western half of the United States, including the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Southwest. During this era, general stores were often the primary source of supplies for settlers, cowboys, and pioneers. These stores provided a wide range of goods, including food, clothing, tools, and other necessities required for everyday life in the harsh and rugged environment of the Old West. Among the commonly available items were whiskey, grain, and saddles: 1. Whiskey was a popular beverage and was consumed for various reasons such as pleasure, relaxation, or medicinal purposes. It could be used as a painkiller, an antiseptic, or a bartering commodity. 2. Grain was an integral part of the settlers' diets, serving as the main ingredient for making bread and other staple foods. It could also be used as animal feed for livestock, which was an essential part of life on the frontier. 3. Saddles were necessary equipment for horseback riding, which was the primary mode of transportation in the Old West. They were indispensable for traveling long distances, working on cattle drives, and engaging in various other activities that required mobility and speed. In contrast, the other options provided - salt, checkers, shopping mall, and meat store - do not offer a contextually appropriate or historically accurate setting for buying whiskey, grain, and saddles at a general store.

A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks.

Described as \\"the theatre's greatest living poet\\" since Samuel Beckett, Müller is arguably the most important German dramatist of the 20th century after Bertolt Brecht. His \\"enigmatic, fragmentary pieces\\" are a significant contribution to postmodern drama and postdramatic theatre. - Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, and poet, who lived in Paris for most of his adult life and wrote in both English and French. He is widely regarded as among the most influential writers of the 20th century. - Dimiter Gotscheff ( Bulgarian : ; born 26 April 1943 in Parvomai , Bulgaria ; died 20 October 2013 in Berlin ) was a Bulgarian - born German theater director . His work is often associated with dramatist and director Heiner Müller . - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The notion of postdramatic theatre was established by German theatre researcher Hans-Thies Lehmann in his book \\"Postdramatic Theatre\\", summarising a number of tendencies and stylistic traits occurring in avant-garde theatre since the end of the 1960s. The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world.

Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.

Background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Paragraph: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake had a lower net productivity?","completion":"Based on the provided information, Long Lake experienced a decrease in fish population due to more frequent water stratification compared to Shoal Lake. Water stratification limits nutrient mixing between layers, which in turn affects primary production by limiting photosynthetic processes. As a result, there would be lower net productivity in the ecosystem. In this scenario, Long Lake had a lower net productivity due to the higher occurrence of water stratification, which led to adverse effects on the overall health and abundance of its fish population. On the other hand, Shoal Lake maintained a healthy and abundant fish population, indicating higher net productivity in comparison to Long Lake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Passage: Norte Chico sites are known for their density of large sites with immense architecture. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, Northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites. Evidence from the ground-breaking work of 1973 at Aspero, at the mouth of the Supe Valley, suggested a site of approximately 13 hectares (32 acres). Surveying of the midden suggested extensive prehistoric construction activity. Small-scale terracing is noted, along with more sophisticated platform mound masonry. As many as eleven artificial mounds \\"could be\\" present. Moseley calls these \\"Corporate Labor Platforms\\", given that their size, layout, and construction materials and techniques would have required an organized workforce.The survey of the northern rivers found sites between 10 and 100 ha (25 and 247 acres); between one and seven large platform mounds—rectangular, terraced pyramids—were discovered, ranging in size from 3,000 m3 (110,000 cu ft) to over 100,000 m3 (3,500,000 cu ft). Shady notes that the central zone of Caral, with monumental architecture, covers an area of just over 65 hectares (160 acres). Six platform mounds, numerous smaller mounds, two sunken circular plazas, and a variety of residential architecture were also discovered at this site.The monumental architecture was constructed with quarried stone and river cobbles. Using reed \\"shicra-bags\\", some of which have been preserved, laborers would have hauled the material to sites by hand. Roger Atwood of Archaeology magazine describes the process: Armies of workers would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the highlands above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags. In this way, the people of Norte Chico achieved formidable architectural success. The largest of the platforms mounds at Caral, the Piramide Mayor, measures 160 by 150 m (520 by 490 ft) and rises 18 m (59 ft) high. In its summation of the 2001 Shady paper, the BBC suggests workers would have been \\"paid or compelled\\" to work on centralized projects of this sort, with dried anchovies possibly serving as a form of currency. Mann points to \\"ideology, charisma, and skilfully timed reinforcement\\" from leaders. Solution:","completion":"1. What is unique about the density of Norte Chico sites according to Haas?

What kind of thing would the answer to the question \\"What nuclear process takes place in an H-bomb ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What nuclear process takes place in an H-bomb?\\" would be a description. Specifically, it would be a description of a scientific process that occurs within a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb. To provide a detailed answer: Hydrogen bombs, or H-bombs, rely on the nuclear fusion process, in which lighter atomic nuclei combine to form heavier atomic nuclei. In the case of an H-bomb, isotopes of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – are used as fuel for the fusion reaction. When a hydrogen bomb is detonated, a fission bomb (similar to an atomic bomb, fueled by the splitting of uranium or plutonium nuclei) is used as a trigger. The energy released by the fission bomb causes the temperature and pressure around the hydrogen fuel to rise dramatically. This extreme environment causes the hydrogen isotopes' nuclei to combine and form helium, releasing an immense amount of energy in the form of an explosion. This process is also accompanied by the release of high-energy neutrons, which can cause further fission in the bomb's fissile material, thereby amplifying the overall energy output. In summary, the answer to the question lies in the description of the process of nuclear fusion that takes place within a hydrogen bomb using isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium, as fuel. The fusion process in an H-bomb is initiated by a fission trigger, which creates the necessary conditions for lighter hydrogen nuclei to combine, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of a powerful explosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – A New York inmate who has never golfed a game in his life is now a free man, with his innocence restored to him thanks to the game. Golf Digest has the incredible conclusion to the story of Valentino Dixon, a 48-year-old who caught the magazine's attention six years ago, when it profiled the detailed colored-pencil drawings he did of golf courses, a passion that began when a warden asked him to illustrate Augusta National’s 12th hole using a photograph. He spent as many as 10 hours a day drawing, and the magazine dove into his art as well as his story. It seemed off. He was serving a 39-years-to-life sentence for the August 1991 murder of 17-year-old Torriano Jackson at a Buffalo street party, reports the AP. What Golf Digest found when it started digging didn't exactly inspire confidence in the conviction: Though the gun was Dixon's, there was no physical evidence, unreliable witnesses, and another man's confession to the crime just two days after it occurred, among other things. Its 2012 article spurred national media coverage and interest from the Georgetown University Prison Reform Project, but as of 2017, things seemed at a dead end. The article explains the \\"confluence of factors\\" that went on to fuel Dixon's vacated conviction, which included the magazine's work and attention on the case from the Erie County district attorney’s wrongful convictions unit.

One day, a person called a warden asked Valentino to draw a picture of a golf course. Valentino liked drawing a lot, so he started to draw many golf courses using his colored pencils. He would spend most of the day doing this. A magazine named Golf Digest saw Valentino's pretty drawings and started asking more questions about his story. They found out that maybe Valentino didn't really hurt anyone and that another person said they did it instead. But nothing changed. A group of superheroes from Georgetown University who help people in prison who didn't do anything bad also tried to help Valentino. After many years, the good people at Golf Digest and the Georgetown University superheroes, along with the kind people at the Erie County district attorney’s office, were able to show that Valentino did not do that bad thing. So, after 27 years in the big building called prison, Valentino was released and became a free man. Now he can draw more golf courses and find out what good things he wants to do in his new life.

Some aides are arguing that the campaign has been given a huge gift: a new opening to argue White House failure and incompetence. “Across the board – domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues – President Obama has been outmatched by events,” said a Romney adviser advocating an aggressive response to the chaos in the Middle East. “He’s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he’s been outmatched.” Text Size - + reset And indeed, POLITICO has learned that Romney now plans a major speech on foreign policy at some point after Wednesday’s debate, probably next week. The speech will focus on “a failed foreign policy and how we arrived at this moment, where people are storming our embassies, [and] the Iranians are storming ahead with their nuclear program,” said a senior Republican close to the campaign. (PHOTOS: 10 slams on Obama and Benghazi) “You can start to go around the world and look at all the crises, and our deteriorating relations with certain countries,” the Republican added. But the campaign is sticking with its day-to-day message on the economy — a view promoted internally by Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist, who is among those arguing that issue is what voters will use to judge whether Obama deserves a second term. “As messy as the world looks, it’s not voters’ primary concern,” a top aide said. “And if we’re not talking about their primary concern, we’re not winning.” The truth is Romney now finds himself besieged with conflicting advice, internally and externally: Attack Obama harder. Offer a detailed agenda. Pivot to foreign policy. Pivot back to the economy. Romney’s response: Ignore it and stick to the game plan, which does not include any serious, sustained detour into foreign policy. His internal polls show the same thing as Obama’s: Voters just don’t care much about foreign policy in this election. This is the reason Obama was so quick to drop his attack on Romney for not mentioning the troops or Afghanistan in his convention speech. Voters didn’t seem to care. (Also on POLITICO: Reid defends Rice, W.H. on Libya) This is basically the Stuart Stevens doctrine. And regardless of the passionate arguments of some other aides, including several outside foreign-policy advisers, the boss is going with Stevens on this until further notice. That doesn’t mean they won’t talk foreign policy at all. Romney’s running mate Paul Ryan previewed the campaign’s argument on “Fox News Sunday,” telling Chris Wallace: “We’re seeing the ugly fruits of the Obama foreign policy unravel around the world on our TV screens. Syria — you’ve got 20,000 dead people. Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon. The Middle East peace process is in shambles, and we have our flags being burned all around the world. Russia is thwarting us at every stage in the process. This is a weak foreign policy with terrible results, which makes us less safe.” For now, Romney and Ryan plan to avoid discussing the Libya attack as an isolated issue, but instead plan to use the issue “to kick-start a broader conversation about the failure of Obama’s foreign policy, around the region and in many parts of the world,” a Romney aide said. Romney and Ryan will answer questions about Libya when asked in interviews, but plan to say very little for now about the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in what the administration is now calling a “terrorist” attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya. ||||| The Obama administration and re-election campaign appeared to give conflicting statements Sunday about the president’s knowledge on the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, according to the Romney camp, which has joined in calling for a clearer explanation of the assault and the U.S. response. Obama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the president called the Sept. 11 strike an act of terror “the day after it happened.” However, David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said later Sunday that “in the days after” the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, it was “not clear” the strike was an act of terror. “This ... obviously was a very, very fast-moving period of time,” Plouffe said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” \\"I think now, based on the recommendations and the investigation of the intelligence community, they made the decision to conclude that this was a terrorist attack.” Axelrod was apparently referring to Obama's public statement on Sept. 12 in which he referred to \\"acts of terror.\\" However, Obama did not explicitly label the attack terrorism at the time -- no administration official did so until the following week. Ryan Williams, Romney campaign spokesman, said in a statement: \\"The Obama White House and the Obama campaign can’t seem to get their stories straight on the attack on our consulate in Libya. This morning, they offered conflicting stories on if and when the President thought the attack in Benghazi was a terrorist act.\\" \\"These inconsistencies raise even more questions about the confusion and mixed messages that have marked the White House’s response from the very beginning,\\" Williams added. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Sept. 16 that the attack was a “spontaneous” response to an anti-Islamic movie trailer and not a pre-planned or terrorist attack. Amid the questions about the administration's handling of the tragedy after the attack are concerns about security in the months preceding it. The New York Times reported Monday that the aggressive response by Libyan security guards to a small bombing in June may have given the U.S. team a false sense of security about the preparedness for a bigger strike. Training and security had been stepped up earlier this year at the recommendation of a Special Forces team. Sen. Bob Corker also is among Republicans calling for more and complete answers about the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya -- where four Americans were killed -- calling the administration’s response so far “bizarre.” “It seems that with each passing day, the situation surrounding the administration’s response to the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya becomes more bizarre. The United States Congress and the American people are still waiting to get straight answers,” Corker told National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper Jr. in the letter dated Sept. 29. The letter follows Clapper taking responsibility last week for the administration’s initial response and acknowledging the assault was a “deliberate and organized terrorist attack.” Corker, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said Plouffe’s comments on Sunday show the administration’s “deafening silence” on the attack in Libya is evidence of “gross negligence or incompetence.” Rep. Peter King, the New York Republican who heads the House Homeland Security Committee, on Friday called for Rice to resign over her \\"misleading\\" statements. Democrats leaped to her defense, accusing King of playing politics. Corker also joins in the growing concern about whether the consulate, as well as U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and the three other Americans killed, had adequate security and why FBI investigators have yet to reach the crime scene. “Yet just 18 days ago the administration apparently judged that it was appropriate for our consulate to be lightly guarded and it was safe for our ambassador to come through the city with a small security detail,” Corker wrote. “What has changed in Libya in such a short time that even FBI agents, our most elite investigative personnel, cannot safely enter the city? What has led to such a precipitous decline?” ||||| WASHINGTON — An effective response by newly trained Libyan security guards to a small bombing outside the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi in June may have led United States officials to underestimate the security threat to personnel there, according to counterterrorism and State Department officials, even as threat warnings grew in the weeks before the recent attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The guards’ aggressive action in June came after the mission’s defenses and training were strengthened at the recommendation of a small team of Special Forces soldiers who augmented the mission’s security force for several weeks in April while assessing the compound’s vulnerabilities, American officials said. “That the local security did so well back in June probably gave us a false sense of security,” said one American official who has served in Libya, and who spoke on condition of anonymity because the F.B.I. is investigating the attack. “We may have fooled ourselves.” The presence of the Special Forces team and the conclusions reached about the role of the Libyan guards offer new insight into the kind of security concerns that American officials had before the attack on Sept. 11. Security at the mission has become a major issue as the Obama administration struggles to explain what happened during the attack, who was responsible and how the ambassador ended up alone. Republicans and Democrats in recent days have demanded more detailed explanations from the White House and State Department on possible security lapses. “There were warnings,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program on Sunday. Just how much American and Libyan officials misread the threat has become even more evident as they analyze the skill with which the mortar attack at an annex a half mile away was carried out by the attackers. That assault, nearly three hours after the initial attack on the main diplomatic mission, killed two former Navy SEALs who were defending the compound. With as few as four armed Americans and three armed Libyans guarding the mission as the attack began, Mr. Stevens’s own bodyguard was so far away that he needed to sprint across the compound under gunfire to reach the building where the ambassador was working at the time. But the bodyguard ultimately left without Mr. Stevens, who died of smoke inhalation. And even after eight additional American security officers arrived from Tripoli, the roughly 30 Americans were surprised and outgunned again in the second attack, dependent on an ad hoc collection of Libyan militiamen to protect their retreat and avoid greater casualties, Libyan officials said. American counterterrorism officials and Libyans on the scene say the mortar attack was most likely carried out by the same group of assailants who had attacked the mission and then followed the convoy of American survivors retreating to what they thought was a safe house. The first mortar shell fell short, but the next two hit their mark in rapid succession with deadly precision, according to an account that David Ubben, one of Mr. Stevens’s security guards, told his father, Rex Ubben, which was supported by other American and Libyan officials. “There are three villas inside and the walls are high, and the only house that got hit was the house we were in,” said Fathi el-Obeidi, a Libyan militia commander who came to help evacuate the Americans. This indicated that many of the assailants were practiced at aiming their mortars, skills they learned in fighting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s army. “David did not draw a distinction between the attackers,” Rex Ubben said in a telephone interview. David Ubben, a 31-year old Iraq war veteran, was wounded in the mortar attack, and is recovering from his wounds at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. His father said he had declined to speak to reporters. The Sept. 11 attack culminated several weeks of growing violence against Western and other diplomatic posts in Benghazi. State Department officials said they were aware of the worsening climate and took precautions. One American official who worked in the mission said the Americans there were able to get around with “appropriate prudence.” One American official, who said he traded e-mails with Mr. Stevens three days before his death, said the ambassador did not mention any heightened security concerns. CNN, however, has reported that Mr. Stevens did express such worries in a diary that one of the network’s correspondents found at the ransacked mission. Eric Schmitt reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick and Suliman Ali Zway from Benghazi, Libya. Steven Lee Myers and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from Washington, and Kitty Bennett from Florida. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This article is about a disagreement among Mitt Romney's advisors regarding the 2012 Presidential campaign. Some of Romney’s advisors wanted to strongly criticize President Barack Obama's foreign policy, especially after the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. They believed that this would show that President Obama was not effectively handling world events. They wanted to argue that his policies led to people storming U.S. embassies and Iran moving forward with its nuclear program. However, other advisors disagreed. They thought it was better to focus on the economy, as they believed that was what voters cared more about. These advisors thought that talking about foreign policy would distract from the issues that voters found most important. Romney ended up deciding not to focus too much on foreign policy. He believed, like President Obama, that voters didn't care much about foreign policy in this election.

Sentence: \\"The scientist ran the rats through the maze.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"The scientist ran the rats through the maze\\" to be acceptable linguistically. The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the basic structure of a modern English sentence: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). It also conveys a clear and understandable meaning. However, it is essential to consider various linguistic perspectives to provide a detailed analysis. From a syntactic perspective, the sentence follows the established rules of English grammar, containing a subject (“the scientist”), a transitive verb (“ran”), a direct object (“the rats”), and a prepositional phrase (“through the maze”). The sentence is formed using the basic structure SVO, common in English, making it easy for readers to parse and understand. From a morphological point of view, the sentence displays proper word formation by using recognizable morphemes - the smallest meaningful units of language. For instance, “scientist” is formed by adding the suffix “-ist” to the root word “science.” Similarly, “maze” and “rats” are singular nouns with recognizable suffixes, “-s” for plural form and “-es” for plural countable nouns. In terms of semantics, the sentence effectively conveys clear and coherent meaning. The reader can understand that there is a scientist who is running rats through a maze, implying an experiment or test involving rats navigating a labyrinth, which is a common scenario in psychological and neurological studies. From a lexical point of view, the vocabulary used in the sentence is appropriate and consistent with standard English usage. The words “scientist,” “ran,” “rats,” and “maze” are all easily understood by native English speakers and provide a clear and unambiguous meaning. Furthermore, the collocation of words, such as \\"scientist\\" and \\"rats,\\" create mental imagery and are common associations in the field of experimental psychology and neuroscience. Lastly, the sentence is also acceptable from a pragmatic standpoint. Pragmatics is focused on the context, intention, and interpretation of language use in different situations. The sentence is clear and effective in conveying the intended message across, as its context can be understood without much difficulty. The reader can infer that the scientist is likely conducting an experiment to study the rats’ cognitive or behavioral capabilities. In conclusion, a linguist would rate the sentence \\"The scientist ran the rats through the maze\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it follows the rules of syntax, morphology, semantics, lexical choice, and pragmatics. The sentence is grammatically correct, clearly conveys its intended meaning, and is coherent with the standards of modern English."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Death penalty opponents often argue that this statistic shows how perilously close states have come to undertaking wrongful executions; proponents point out that the statistic refers only to those exonerated in law, and that the truly innocent may be a smaller number. Statistics likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed.

Title: King Kong Movie plot: In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \\"wed\\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: To members of Generation X, Buick has long been a name associated (and perhaps unfairly) with octogenarian dreams or hangover heaving. But if the company has any say about the future of it’s brand image, this is slowly but surely changing. That’s right, 40-somethings, Buick is coming for you. But fret not, young’uns. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. When Buick introduced the Avenir concept during the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, showcasing it as the future design direction for the brand, many people speculated that the sheet-pull actually revealed a production-ready replacement for the company’s full-size sedan, the LaCrosse. A blink of an eye later (by automotive industry standards) the all-new 2017 LaCrosse took center runway during the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show modeling a leaner, longer and lower profile. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. Taking bold steps in unlikely directions, Buick’s focus and audience remains affluent but increasingly younger. Witness the new Envision compact crossover, which is quickly proving itself an international bestseller. Consider the new Cascada convertible, already winning awards and bringing some fresh air into the lineup. And when the flagship LaCrosse goes on sale later this month, starting at 32,065 (not including the 925 destination charge), expectations are nothing short of segment leading. In advance of the showroom gleam expected from the LaCrosse’s new-car shine, I spent a few hours experiencing the premium full-size sedan first-hand in Portland, Oregon. A full 300 pounds leaner yet packed with new technology and reengineered for better driving precision, the all-new 2017 LaCrosse, like its Pacific Northwest surroundings, proved unforgivingly pleasant. North American-designed for a global audience Design is a tricky thing. There will always be lovers and haters. In the case of the new Buick LaCrosse, rest assured there will be fewer haters. While not the most distinctive of automobiles, the LaCrosse’s lack of polarizing points is what’s attractive about the car. With luxury increasingly leaning toward notice-me-now styling, this Buick’s subtle strength lies in its ability to elicit appreciative stares instead of gawking glares. Indeed, the LaCrosse is equipped with a face your grandmother could love…but also your mother, your sister, your niece, your wife, your girlfriend, and all your lady friends in between. Putting forth a handsome visage without hint of a smile, sneer or smirk, the 2017 LaCrosse is the first Buick to feature the brand’s new badge. To become standard on all 2018 models, the LaCrosse literally puts center stage the recognizable crest with its diagonally arranged shields – now in red, silver and blue. It’s a small change with a significant return. “That’s a Buick?” seems almost a foolish question. Seemingly classic and modern at once, the LaCrosse features a traditional Buick “sweep spear” profile comprised of two distinct character lines. The first flows seamlessly from the grille, sweeping over the headlights and across the front fenders into the doors, where it fades. The second emerges from the front door handles, swells boldly into the masculine haunches, and melts away after drawing the eye to the arched deck lid and boomerang-shaped LED tail lamps. The result is more cohesive and dramatic than the awkwardly penned spear defining the previous LaCrosse. With a roofline 1.6 inches lower than the current LaCrosse, the 2017 model sits on a wheelbase that is stretched 2.7 inches, yet the car’s overall length grows by an almost indecipherable 0.6 inches. The big Buick also gains just 0.4 inches in the waist, although its wheels have been pushed outward 1.3 inches in the front and 1.1 inches in the rear. This lower, sportier stance provides the LaCrosse with a confident but not cocky road presence. After opening the large but lithe doors, getting into or out of the LaCrosse is easy. Once inside, perforated leather seats hug your frame as might your favorite old couch. Yet unlike that furnishing’s familiar mold of your favorite Netflix binge-watching position, the LaCrosse adds the benefit of support and cushioning in all the right places. Nearly every interior surface is covered in satisfyingly soft materials. And with trim colors named Brandy, Shale and Dark Atmosphere surrounding ebony accents, you might as well sink in. Clean design is the name of the interior’s game as the instrument panel features only a handful of familiar knobs for operating the audio and dual-zone climate control systems. Knob-turners can also go new-school via the 8-inch full-color touchscreen display, or employ voice commands to access additional features such as standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot integration. The touchscreen remains accessible when the vehicle is in motion, which is helpful for front-seat passengers who are assisting the driver in figuring out prompts and accessing information. A head-up display is standard on Premium models (41,065) and projects information such as speed, navigation, audio, performance, and certain active safety features onto the windshield within the driver’s line of sight. The LaCrosse’s HUD also allows for added personalization of brightness and visual height, which is particularly beneficial for someone of my barely-see-over-the-dash, five-foot-two stature. Tinkering with some new tech, the all-new Electronic Precision Shift proves awkward in instruction but relatively easy in execution. To shift into Drive, merely thumb in the controller’s side button and toggle right then down. Fittingly, accessing Reverse requires the reverse motion, and selecting Park requires a pressing of the “P” button on the top side of the shifter. (Stop snickering.) Neither odd nor optimal, the electronic gear selector frees up space upon and within the console itself. Where a traditional shifter’s mechanics would be, Buick instead provides a rubber-lined cubby for slide-free storage. Although the LaCrosse is not wanting in terms of beverage holders or snack cubbies, it does lack an overhead eyewear storage compartment. For my diminutive arm span, this is my sunglasses location of choice as the LaCrosse’s under-console cavern proved a bit of, well, a stretch for me. Lengthy-limbed front passengers may also suffer finger-jamming problems on occasion. Average-sized persons, we envy you. Conveniently, however, the driver’s side 12-volt power port is placed in an accessible-for-all position. The LaCrosse also features wireless charging, ensuring that our gadgets and gizmos never cease functioning as the electronic leashes they’ve become. Regardless of the car, programs that introduce a new vehicle to the media are, in essence, manufactured fairytales. Drive routes are not chosen by accident or for convenience but are instead calculated to every smooth surface, off-camber angle, climb and descent, ensuring all the while that they wind through picture-perfect scenery (because pretty). The Pacific Northwest, however, is not the ideal locale for a vehicle introduction because the roadways can and will be porous, coarse surfaces (read: loud). So decibel-vaulting are the roads that they make a Saturday night East Village bar crowd seem like a weekday library visit. But the Buick engineering team was so confident, maybe even boastful, of the new LaCrosse’s QuietTuned cabin that they didn’t even try to apologize. Was their hubris worth it? Sections of road during our round-trip drive from downtown Portland to idyllic Astoria made themselves known like the jarring early-morning battles between New York cabbies and deliveries. While you might get used to the noise, you still wish you didn’t have to. On smooth roads, the LaCrosse is quiet – as a premium vehicle should be. On moderate pavement, yes, it’s audibly satisfactory. On the eardrum-piercing surfaces of Oregon? Just hang up the phone call and accept the graveling din. Still, the two vehicles I tested did effortlessly absorb road vibrations, keeping me fairly content in my comfy couch of a bucket seat. In one vehicle, I did experience mildly annoying wind noise during some freeway driving but less so over the same section in another vehicle. A quirky window seal gremlin perhaps, but one quickly forgotten when the steering wheel was in my hands. The Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan that doesn’t act like one. My co-driver and I took turns in a silver LaCrosse Essence with front-wheel drive (38,665), loaded with 20-inch wheels and every option package, and in a black LaCrosse Premium with all-wheel drive (43,265), outfitted with a sunroof (1,550) and safety equipment (1,690). All in, the two vehicles were priced fairly close (43,430 and 46,505) but were as different as their Pantone paints. All 2017 LaCrosse models are equipped with a direct-injected 3.6-liter V6 engine estimated to produce 310 horsepower at 6,800 rpm and 282 pound-feet of torque at 5,200 rpm. The power is more than adequate to move the roughly 3,600-pound sedan. The fuel-saving engine start/stop system also performed so politely that I almost didn’t notice it. Often, such systems produce a sputter and a shakedown. In the Buick, everything was appropriately fluid. The 8-speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly, too. It wasn’t perfect as there was the occasional foot-to-floor downshift lag, but there’s nothing here to break-up with Buick over. A new five-link rear suspension and a MacPherson-strut front suspension come as standard equipment, and opting for the 20-inch alloys adds Buick’s HiPer strut front suspension as well as continuously adjustable dampers and driver-selected Touring and Sport modes. Change to Sport mode, and the shift in the car’s attitude is almost instant. The steering feel is stiffer but more precise and feedback is pleasing. Winding roads encourage more aggressive driving and curves beg to be apexed (which you should always be doing, anyway). Models with 18-inch wheels lack a Sport mode selection, but this is not a penalty by any means. Comfort and capability are traits evident on any LaCrosse trim level. In standard tune, some steering precision disappears but the vehicle remains light on its toes and provides ample driving enjoyment despite its smaller shoes. And you’ll easily surpass speed limits without even trying. I didn’t anticipate disliking the redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse. I merely didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did, especially when you consider I am in my 30s and have a bias toward compacts outfitted with loud turbos. This Buick is not one of those cars. But it was good to feel like an adult for a day. Whether the all-new LaCrosse is truly segment leading remains to be seen, but based on my brief encounter it’s certainly off to a pleasing start.

Oddly, Romanian has retained certain features of Latin which other Romance languages have lost. For example, unlike most Romance languages, which have two genders (masculine and feminine), Romanian has kept the neuter of Latin, although it is somewhat modified and closer to masculine. Romanian vocabulary has been strongly influenced by Western languages, such as French and Italian, but it also contains words from other languages such as German, Hungarian, and Turkish. Despite so many influences from other countries, however, Romanian has maintained its Latin character with about 75% of its words coming from the ancient language.

Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent The Ohio State University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.

It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission.

Translate to English","completion":"Tariff Policy Prior to the reform of the Georgian water supply and sanitation sector, tariffs for water utilities were approved by local authorities, who, considering the difficult economic situation of the population, in most cases set tariffs that did not cover the costs of enterprises related to the provision of utilities and services. Before the reform of the water supply and sanitation sector in Georgia, the tariff policy was determined by local authorities. The overall economic situation of the population was challenging, and as a result, the tariffs set often didn't cover the expenses incurred by the enterprises providing public utilities and services. As the tariff policy was determined at the local level, there could be inconsistencies and inefficiencies in how the tariffs were implemented across different regions. The main purpose of the reform process was to address these issues and create a more sustainable and efficient system for managing water supply and sanitation services. The reform aimed to establish a more transparent and accountable tariff-setting process that better reflected the actual costs of providing water and sanitation services. A key aspect was to ensure that the tariffs were fair and affordable for the population while also enabling enterprises to cover their operational costs. Another goal of the reform was to promote investment in the water supply and sanitation sector, including infrastructure improvements, modernization, and capacity building. By implementing a more sustainable tariff policy, it would enable the sector to attract investors and secure the necessary funds for growth and development. The tariff policy reform also aimed to improve the quality and reliability of water supply and sanitation services by encouraging enterprises to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This included adopting better technologies and management practices, as well as implementing performance-based incentives to motivate enterprises in meeting service standards. Overall, the reform of the water supply and sanitation sector in Georgia sought to address significant challenges in the tariff policy and create a more sustainable, efficient, and transparent system for managing these essential services. By doing so, it was hoped that the population would benefit from improved water and sanitation services while also supporting the long-term growth and development of the sector."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is also an odd number. So, 125 is multiplied by three and then one is added. 125 * 3 + 1 = 376. - Third is 73. This is another odd number. Thus, 73 is multiplied by three and then one is added. 73 * 3 + 1 = 220. - Fourth is 33. This remains an odd number. As such, 33 is multiplied by three and then one is added. 33 * 3 + 1 = 100. - Fifth is 184. Since this is an even number, it simply is divided by two. 184 / 2 = 92. - Sixth is 144. This is also an even number, so it is divided by two. 144 / 2 = 72. - Seventh, and final, is 183. This is a notably odd number.

Question: The place where students run a number of news media outlets is a kind of? Context: As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production.

How to move to another state when you have custody of your child Identify if you have sole custody. In some-but not all-states, you can move your children out of state if you have a permanent order for sole custody. This is the law in california, for example. Answer:","completion":"[ii] However, many states don't acknowledge the concept of \\"sole\\" custody, and their laws will be very different. Accordingly, you always need to find out your state's requirements. It's essential that you research your state's specific laws regarding child custody and relocation before making any plans to move out of state. Custody laws can differ significantly between jurisdictions, and understanding how these laws apply to your situation is crucial in ensuring a smooth transition for both you and your child. 1. Research your state's custody laws and relocation requirements: Begin by reviewing your state's family law statutes or consulting with a knowledgeable family law attorney in your area. You can also look for information on your state's court website or visit your local law library to access relevant resources. In general, you'll need to determine whether your state has specific requirements for obtaining permission to move out of state and how this can be done, either through court hearings or mediation. 2. Consult with the other parent: If you have a cooperative relationship with the child's other parent, it's important to discuss your plans for moving and how this will affect the child's relationship with both of you. Be prepared to address concerns and possibly make compromises to ensure that the child's best interests are met. Remember that the other parent may have legal rights regarding the child that must be respected, such as visitation rights or joint legal decision-making authority. 3. Prepare a proposed parenting plan: If you have to go to court to request permission to move, you'll likely need to submit a proposed parenting plan that outlines how you intend to maintain a relationship between the child and the noncustodial parent in your new location. This plan should include details about visitation schedules, transportation arrangements, and how you'll handle any issues that arise after the move, such as scheduling conflicts or changes in the child's needs. 4. Obtain court approval if necessary: In some cases, you'll need to seek court approval before moving out of state with your child. This may involve attending a court hearing or participating in mediation, where you'll have the opportunity to present your case to a judge or mediator. Be prepared to explain why the move is in the child's best interest and provide evidence to support this, such as increased job prospects, better educational opportunities, or closer proximity to extended family members who can provide support. 5. Notify the other parent and obtain written consent (if possible): Even if your state doesn't require court approval for your move, it's generally recommended that you obtain written consent from the other parent before relocating with your child. This can help to prevent future disputes and provide a record of your agreement should any issues arise later. 6. Update your custody order (if applicable): If your move has been approved by the court or agreed upon by both parents, it's important to update your custody order to reflect these changes. This may involve submitting a new parenting plan or modifying your existing order to include provisions related to the move, such as child support adjustments or changes in visitation schedules. By considering these steps and being proactive in meeting your state's requirements, you can help to facilitate a smoother move for both you and your child while ensuring that the interests of all involved parties are protected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was the youngest passenger on board the ship when it tragically sank after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912. Millvina was born on February 2, 1912, just a few months before the Titanic's maiden voyage. Her parents, Bertram Frank Dean and Eva Georgetta Light Dean, along with her older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, decided to emigrate from England to Wichita, Kansas, in the United States, where her father had plans to open a tobacco shop. The family initially planned to travel on another ship, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto the Titanic. At the time of the sinking, Millvina was only nine weeks old and, along with her mother and brother, managed to escape the ill-fated ship on Lifeboat 10. Unfortunately, her father perished in the disaster and was among the more than 1,500 lives lost. After their harrowing experience, Millvina's mother decided to return to England with her children, where they lived the rest of their lives. Despite being a Titanic survivor, Millvina had no memory of the disaster, and her mother did not speak of the incident until Millvina was in her 8th year. After learning of her connection to the Titanic, Millvina largely kept the fact a secret for many years, only sharing her story later in life. In her later years, Millvina participated in Titanic-related events, conferences, and interviews, often providing an invaluable personal account of her family's experience. As the last survivor of the Titanic, Millvina Dean was a living link to the past and a poignant reminder of one of history's most tragic maritime disasters.

In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising Minamoto family. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne.

Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game.

TEXT:I never understood why some people dislike Bollywood films: they've got charismatic actors, great dance numbers, and heightened emotion--what's not to like? What I didn't realize was that I had only seen the upper-crust of Bollywood. Then I watched \\"Garam Masala\\". I could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie I was going to like (the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models), but I kept hoping things would improve. Sadly, they didn't. The main problem is that the two protagonists, Mac & Sam, are completely unsympathetic. They spend the entire movie lying to women--and lying brutally- -in order to get them into bed, and the audience is supposed to find this funny, and be charmed. The boys are unscrupulous and inept, and not in a lovable way. Mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating. The script is extremely poor, with repetitive scenes, setups that never lead to anything, and illogical actions and statements by the characters. In fact, the characters are never really developed at all. The males are boorish, greedy jerks, and the women merely interchangeably beautiful. If you go by this movie, you would think that \\"air hostesses\\" are pretty easy to pass from man to man. In reality, betrayal is not so humorous. The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets, and a few slapsticky moments involving the French-farce, door-slamming aspects of the story. But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan, and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, who seem to have influenced writer/director Priyadarshan not a little. Priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story: the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play \\"Boeing Boeing.\\" The original author of that work, Marc Camoletti, is credited nowhere. At least Priyadarshan changed the title for this remake, rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit, as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale.

PUBLISHED:. 01:14 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:18 EST, 9 May 2013. Police investigating the disappearance of Jessica Heeringa, the Michigan woman abducted in late April during her shift at a gas station, have said that the suspicious substance found at the scene where she vanished is her blood. 'The substance has been confirmed as blood,' police said in a statement released today. 'Based on a subsequent DNA analysis, the blood has been confirmed to be from Jessica Lynn Heeringa.' Police said that there was only a small amount of blood located at the Norton Shores, Mich., Exxon gas station where Heeringa was working on a late shift. The 25-year-old mother of one was within moments of closing the station when she vanished. Police have revealed that Jessica Heeringa's blood was found at the gas station where she disappeared. Heeringa's family has been notified that her blood was found at the scene, police said. Last Tuesday police released a second video. in the hope that it will help lead to a breakthrough in the mystery of a mother. who went missing on April 26. The video, police say, more. clearly shows traffic in the area, including a silver minivan that. police have been in search of as they've continued trying to unravel. this mystery. A 15,000 reward has been pledged by Exxon Mobil to go toward a reward fund for Heeringa, who was working at an Exxon Mobil station when she disappeared. The. footage comes from a business a mile from the Exxon station, which had. no cameras, and show's the silver van passing around 11:04pm. Police believe Heeringa disappeared between 10:50 and 11:15 that night. New footage: Police say this latest video evidence released in the disappearnce case of Jessica Heeringa shows a suspect silver minivan. Clue: Christian Van Antwerpen, pictured, says he heard the van's driver flirting with Heeringa 'suspiciously' hours before she vanished April 26. Do you know this man? Police have released this sketch, left, of a man seen driving away from the gas station in Michigan where young mother Jessica Heeringa, right, was last seen last month. Antwerpen said he did not see the man, but only heard his voice. The. tip is yet another among the hundreds police say have come in since. Heeringa vanished and will be added to the evidence. investigators have thus far been able to gather. The sketch of a wavy-haired man was released April 30,. based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from. the gas station - and police hoped it would reinvigorate. their investigation. 'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton. Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some. of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the. sketch. Workplace: The Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores, Michigan - from where Heeringa was snatched. the parent company has pledged a 15,000 reward. 'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.' Authorities. have also released previous video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead. Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area. around the same time that Heeringa went missing. Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence,. but hoped releasing it, too, could help unlock the. mystery. Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV:. 'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it. up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesn’t exist for me.' He. told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town &. Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's. disappearance. Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old. Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor. 'There. is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who. the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews. Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm. Vigil: A friend hugs Shelly Heeringa, Jessica's mother, during a vigil at Pointes Mall in Norton Shores. That. customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he. normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there. After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police. Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend. In the call, he tells the dispatcher:. 'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just. walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car. out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.' Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm. The missing woman's family made a. heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her. disappearance as an abduction. Plea: Shelly Heeringa attended the vigil for her daughter on Tuesday as police released the sketch. In. a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were. treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene. No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter. Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.' With no surveillance footage from the gas station, police are relying on public information for help in the investigation. 'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.' The. anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved. by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing. his mom and wants her back.' Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident. 'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.' Missed: Heeringa was allegedly abducted at about 11pm on Friday from the gas station. Hope: Liz Lunsford of Muskegon releases balloons across the street from the Exxon Mobil gas station. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"Sure, here are some simple main points from the article: 1. A woman named Jessica Heeringa, who worked at a gas station in Michigan, disappeared while she was closing the station for the night. 2. The police found some blood at the gas station, and tests proved that the blood was Jessica's. 3. They also got a video showing a silver minivan near the gas station around the time Jessica disappeared. They think this van could be important. 4. A 15,000 reward has been offered by Exxon Mobil, which is where Jessica was working when she disappeared, for information that brings her back. 5. Police also have a drawing of a man seen driving away from the gas station. They think this man might know something about what happened to Jessica. 6. The person who might have taken Jessica might be someone she knew because there were no signs of a fight in the store. 7. Jessica's family and the police are really worried and are asking for anyone with information to come forward. 8. Jessica is a mom with a 3-year-old boy who misses her a lot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In BCS Title Hunt, It's Go for Throat As college football enters the final weeks of the season, the stakes have never been higher. Teams jockey for the coveted spots in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings, and every decision becomes scrutinized and dissected by analysts and fans alike. However, one aspect of the game that has come under special attention is the sportsmanship aspect, specifically, the concept of taking a knee. While some coaches and players believe in showing mercy and respect towards their opponents through taking a knee, others argue that this is not just any regular season game – it is a high stakes BCS title hunt. Thus, \\"go for the throat\\" becomes a common mentality, prompting aggressive play calling and the relentless pursuit of victory. In recent years, taking a knee has become a contentious issue in various sports. More often than not, we see teams with significant leads choosing to \\"salt the clock\\" by kneeling, thus ensuring a victory without further embarrassing their opponents. Some argue that this displays sportsmanship, while others contend that this is not always the case. In the realm of college football, however, the debate takes on added significance due to the BCS rankings. With the BCS rankings determined by a complex formula that considers various factors, including a team's strength of schedule, the coaches' and Harris Interactive Polls, as well as the average computer rankings, every point scored could impact the final standings. Critics of the \\"go for the throat\\" mentality question whether college football has lost its sense of sportsmanship. They argue that the preoccupation with scores, rankings, and bowl games has turned the sport into a ruthless business, with players and coaches more concerned about their statistics and job security than with maintaining the traditions and values of the game. By running up the score, teams reinforce the notion that winning is the only thing that matters, and that any means justify the end. However, proponents of this aggressive mentality argue that it ultimately brings out the best in teams and athletes. They believe that in the high-pressure BCS title hunt, there is no time for mercy or for taking it easy. The sport demands competitors push themselves to the absolute limit, with the knowledge that their efforts on the field can make or break their chance at that elusive BCS title. By going for the throat, teams are only utilizing their full potential and playing to the best of their abilities. The pursuit of victory is quintessential to the spirit of the sport, and the BCS atmosphere only amplifies this. Additionally, those who support \\"going for the throat\\" argue that it is better to face the reality of the BCS rankings and play accordingly than to pretend it doesn't exist. As a team, the goal is ultimately to win, and if running up the score is part of the strategy, then so be it. Furthermore, they contend there is no hard and fast rule that declaring they should ease off the pedal in the final minutes of a game when victory is all but assured. Every team is different, and there will always be disagreements regarding the right approach in these situations. As the race for the BCS title continues to heat up, the discussion surrounding sportsmanship and competitiveness will likely persist. While some may argue for the traditional approach of taking a knee and demonstrating mercy, others will contend that these are extraordinary circumstances. The BCS title hunt is not just another regular season game – it is a championship pursuit where every point matters, and for many, \\"going for the throat\\" is deemed an essential part of achieving their ultimate goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the course of several days, participants donned colorful costumes, danced to rhythmic beats, and indulged in an exuberant cultural experience that epitomizes the nation’s joy and love for life. Carnival, or \\"Carnaval\\" in Portuguese, is a pre-Lent festive tradition observed in many countries. However, the Brazilian Carnival has evolved into a massive spectacle that attracts millions of tourists worldwide. This vibrant festival highlights the fusion of European, African, and Indigenous cultures that make up Brazil's unique cultural identity. Each region of the country boasts its distinct Carnival celebrations, but the world-famous events in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Paulo, and Olinda are incomparable in their grandeur. This year's Carnival saw an eclectic mix of themes, with revelers going all out in artistic expression. Brilliantly adorned floats captivated audiences, while percussion-heavy Samba music reverberated through the air, inducing an infectious atmosphere of celebration. The much-anticipated Samba school parades were another highlight of the Carnival, as various schools displayed their spellbinding performances, vying for the top spot in the fiercely competitive yearly affair. Among the unique Brazilian Carnival customs are the \\"blocos\\" – informal street parades and parties where people sing, dance, and often play instruments. Attendees decorated themselves with feathers, glitter, and body paint while flaunting their creativity through extravagant outfit designs. The blocos were a kaleidoscope of colors that transformed the urban landscape into a vibrant tableau during the festival. Amid all the fun and excitement, there was also a social aspect to the Carnival. Many participants took the opportunity to voice their opinions on political and social issues. On this occasion, calls for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental preservation were prominent. The festival's unity-in-diversity spirit provided a platform for constructive dialogue and an opportunity for individuals to make assertive, impactful statements. The Brazilian Carnival is a time to unwind and experience life's pleasures to the fullest, a brief moment for people to forget their daily stresses and embrace happiness. Street vendors looking to capitalize on the high spirits and large crowds set up shop, offering tantalizing street food ranging from the traditional \\"acarajé\\" to sweet \\"brigadeiros.\\" As the Carnival drew to a close, old friendships were strengthened, new bonds were formed, and memories were created that would last a lifetime. The remaining hours saw participants dancing tirelessly, with the intoxicating Samba beats propelling them forward as they sought to savor every last moment of this time-honored festival. The sun began to set, casting a golden hue over the streets, and the revelers understood that, although carnival season was ending, they were already looking forward to next year's grand fiesta. In conclusion, the Brazilian Carnival serves as a glorious display of the nation's vibrant culture and the contagious joy that flows through its veins. For both locals and tourists, the Carnival is an unforgettable experience that reiterates the significance of unity, creativity, and self-expression. As the Carnival concluded, participants went back to their daily lives with rejuvenated spirits and cherished memories, eagerly anticipating next year's extravagant celebration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has now been told he will not face any charges. He said he volunteered to co-operate and complained that the decision to arrest him was disproportionate. He also plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Police Ombudsman. The former officer was one of seven men questioned in June 2014 about the awarding of police vehicle contracts. He had strenuously denied any wrongdoing, and on Tuesday, his solicitor received a letter from the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) informing him that his client will not face any charges. \\"This matter can be resolved very quickly in an easy way if Chief Constable George Hamilton, who I know personally, is prepared to offer his regrets for what happened,\\" Mr McCausland told BBC Radio Ulster. \\"But I have to consider everything because my reputation has been damaged.\\" He said the allegations against him were not founded on any evidence. \\"The police have a unique power, which is to remove someone's liberty, and that should be as a last resort,\\" he said. \\"There was absolutely no need to remove my liberty or anyone else's liberty, because people were prepared to fully co-operate with the police.\\" Responding to Mr McCausland's remarks, the PSNI chief constable said he is \\"wholly content\\" with the way in which the police dealt with the case. Welcoming the fact that the process had concluded, George Hamilton said he fully respected the direction made by the PPS. \\"I am wholly content that the PSNI fulfilled their legal obligations in response to this investigation and reported all available evidence to the PPS,\\" he said. \\"I am also entirely satisfied with the integrity and professionalism of the investigation. \\"Prosecutorial decisions are a matter for the PPS\\". Detectives were investigating allegations of bribery and misconduct in public office in the awarding of contracts for police vehicles. Mr McCausland had criticised his former employer for arresting him, because he had volunteered to assist the investigation. The Public Prosecution Service said in its letter to Mr McCausland's solicitor that, based upon evidence currently available, the test for prosecution had not been met. Mr McCausland was one of the most high profile PSNI officers before retiring in March 2011, under the Patten redundancy scheme. The owner of one of Northern Ireland's largest car dealerships, who was also among the seven men questioned in 2014, has also been told he will not face any charges. Terence Donnelly, of Donnelly Brothers, had always maintained that he would be completely exonerated in relation to all allegations arising from the investigation. In a statement to the BBC, his solicitor said Mr Donnelly welcomed the decision by the PPS. In April this year, a former PSNI officer who had gone on to lead an English police force was told he would not face charges as a result of the same investigation. Mark Gilmore was suspended as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police in June 2014 after being questioned by the PSNI. His suspension was lifted in May after the PPS informed him it would not be pressing charges. However, he has not resumed his role as chief constable.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style? is inside the article: Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,..., can you guess it ?

By its count, there are roughly 20,000 payday lender locations in the US, which works out to one for about every 16,000 people. McDonald's currently has 14,267 locations, per NBC News, which notes that the small (typically 500 or less), short-term (most often 14 days, as full payment of the loan and fees is due on the borrower's next payday) loans are most typically used by those \\"at or near the bottom of the economic spectrum.\\" And those that make use of payday lenders may find their financial situation worsened: The mean payday borrower makes 22,476 a year and paid 458, or 2% of their annual income, in fees. And those using payday loans typically owe money to lenders during 55% of the year. And as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau put it in a 2013 report, \\"these products may become harmful for consumers when they are used to make up for chronic cash flow shortages.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"Payday lenders can be found in larger numbers throughout the United States than even the fast-food giant, McDonald’s. This is according to an edition of Inside the Vault, a newsletter from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. In their report, they estimated that there are nearly 20,000 brick-and-mortar payday loan lenders in the US. When divided by the country's population, this averages to about one payday lender for every 16,000 people. Comparatively, McDonald’s, which is often seen as one of the most omnipresent corporate icons, currently operates 14,267 outlets as stated by NBC News. Payday loans are essentially small loans, usually 500 or less, designed to sustain a borrower until their next paycheck comes in. They are intended to be short-term loans, most often having a term of 14 days, as the full repayment of the loan with all its associated fees is due on the borrower’s next payday. This type of financial service is most commonly availed by individuals who are \\"at or near the bottom of the economic spectrum\\" as these loans provide quick, albeit pricey, financial relief in times of immediate need. However, frequent use of payday loans may lead to a worsening financial situation for these borrowers. According to data, the average payday loan borrower earns a yearly income of 22,476 and spends 458, equating to 2% of their annual income, solely on loan fees. Additionally, borrowers of payday loans typically find themselves in debt for more than half the year. In a 2013 report, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau warned that these products could be damaging for consumers when utilized as a band-aid for chronic cash flow issues. When relied upon too heavily, these high-cost, short-term loans can contribute to a cycle of ongoing debt, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to stabilize their financial situation. In light of the number of payday lenders abundantly outnumbering McDonald's locations, the prevalence and potential issues surrounding payday loans in America become even more apparent. As financial needs rise, so does the industry responding to it, often time to the detriment of borrowers in the lower economics spectrum, leading to an insidious cycle of debt and further economic distress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Answer choices: - Energy. - Chemical energy - Carbon Dioxide - Organic compounds - flow of electrons - heat energy - oxidation reaction - temperature The answer is:","completion":"Carbon Dioxide. The carbon cycle is a natural process that involves the continuous circulation of carbon atoms between the Earth's atmosphere, organisms, and the environment. Carbon is essential for life, as it forms the backbone of various organic compounds critical for the structure and functioning of living organisms, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key component in the carbon cycle and is transferred between organisms and the atmosphere. CO2 is a byproduct of various biological and physical processes, such as cellular respiration, combustion of fossil fuels, and volcanic eruptions. In the atmosphere, CO2 absorbs and emits infrared radiation, playing a crucial role in the greenhouse effect and the regulation of Earth's climate. Photosynthesizing organisms, mainly plants and certain types of bacteria, convert atmospheric CO2 into energy-rich organic compounds during the process of photosynthesis. These organic compounds are then used by living organisms to produce energy, build constituent molecules, or are stored for later use. When organisms respire, combust, or decay, the carbon stored in these organic compounds is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, completing the carbon cycle. Besides CO2, the carbon cycle also involves the transfer of various organic compounds that contain carbon atoms such as glucose, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides.

While both sentences seem to share the concept of describing an animal with similar colors, the key differences lie in the type of animal, additional descriptive information, and overall intent of each sentence. Here's a breakdown of the differences and similarities between the two sentences: 1. Type of animal: The first sentence talks about a sheep, while the second sentence describes a calf. Sheep and calves are distinct types of animals – sheep are typically raised for their wool, while calves are young cattle. 2. Descriptive information: In the first sentence, the focus is primarily on the color of the sheep and their proximity to each other, while the second sentence offers additional information about the calf, such as the tag on its ear. Tags on ears may denote ownership, identification, or other relevant information about the animal, so the mention of the tag introduces an aspect not present in the first sentence. 3. Overall intent: The first sentence primarily serves to describe a scene involving a black and white sheep and a white sheep walking together. Meanwhile, the second sentence focuses on the specific features of a calf, rather than its interactions with other animals. Given the differences in animal type, level of detail, and overall intent of each sentence, I believe the similarity between these sentences is quite low, hence my rating of 1 out of 5. They do share the common aspect of describing animals with black and white colors, which is why the rating isn't 0, but the key differences make them distinct from one another."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur. Are the particles in Beaker X more or less likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, it's clear that at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, allowing them to move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and collide with greater force. Given that Beaker A is on a burner set to a low temperature and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature: 1. I will first consider the temperature difference between the two burners. Beaker X will have a higher temperature than Beaker A, due to the different settings on the burners. 2. Since Beaker X has a higher temperature than Beaker A, the particles in Beaker X will have more energy compared to the particles in Beaker A. 3. With more energy, the particles in Beaker X will move faster compared to the particles in Beaker A. 4. As the particles in Beaker X move faster, they are more likely to bump into each other and collide with greater force than the particles in Beaker A. In conclusion, the particles in Beaker X are more likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A. This is because the higher temperature in Beaker X causes the particles to have more energy and move faster, leading to increased collisions and reaction rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the one hand, anarchy engulfs Sudan, Zaire, and other nations, and this chaos helps spread nasty diseases (malaria, cholera, AIDS, etc.) around the world. Does it follow that \\"Malaria, cholera, and AIDS are nasty contagious diseases that can be spread around the world.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it does follow that \\"Malaria, cholera, and AIDS are nasty contagious diseases that can be spread around the world.\\" These diseases pose significant risks to public health and can be facilitated by factors such as anarchy, political instability, and lack of access to essential healthcare services. Let us look at each disease in detail to understand their contagious nature and the impact they can have on affected populations. 1. Malaria: Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The disease is transmitted primarily through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is considered a significant global health threat, with an estimated 216 million cases and around 445,000 deaths occurring in 2016 alone. The majority of these cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where political instability and weak healthcare systems can exacerbate the spread of the disease. Climate change, international travel, and migration can also contribute to the expansion of malaria's reach, increasing the risk of outbreaks in previously unaffected areas. 2. Cholera: Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. Cholera outbreaks typically occur in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. As with malaria, political instability and weak healthcare infrastructure can worsen the spread of cholera. In conflict-affected regions, displaced populations often live in overcrowded camps with inadequate systems for sanitation and provision of clean water, increasing the risk of cholera outbreaks. While cholera is endemic in many parts of the world, it can quickly become a significant public health issue when natural disasters, war, or civil unrest lead to large-scale displacement and a breakdown of essential services. 3. AIDS: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is primarily spread through unprotected sex, sharing of infected needles, or mother-to-child transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding. While AIDS is indeed a global health concern, it is important to note that it is not spread as easily as malaria or cholera. Unlike these other diseases, AIDS cannot be transmitted through casual contact, contaminated food, or water. Rather, the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS can be attributed to factors such as high-risk sexual behavior, intravenous drug use, lack of awareness or stigma around the disease, and limited access to testing and treatment options. In countries suffering from anarchy and political unrest, healthcare systems may be insufficient or completely collapsed, contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS. To summarize, it is accurate to say that malaria, cholera, and AIDS are nasty contagious diseases that can spread around the world. These diseases are particularly prevalent in regions experiencing anarchy, civil unrest, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, which can contribute to the widespread dissemination of these infectious diseases. International collaboration, improved surveillance, and investment in healthcare systems are crucial in mitigating the risks posed by these diseases and protecting global public health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is the ethnicity of Henry Louis Gates?\\" Context: \\"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Henry Louis Gates Jr. is an African American scholar, writer, and public intellectual. He currently serves as the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University. Gates is renowned for his work in the field of African American literature, cultural studies, and genealogy, and has won numerous awards and honors for his contributions to these fields. In the context provided, the discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni highlighted an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at the institution. Gates, along with Lani Guinier, observed that the majority of black students at Harvard were not from the historical African American community, but rather from Caribbean and African immigrant backgrounds or the children of biracial couples. This led to an underrepresentation of students who are descendants of African American slaves. Given this context, and based on Gates' own scholarship and career in studying the African American experience, it is clear that his ethnicity is African American—meaning that he is a part of the community that traces its ancestry back to African slaves who were brought to the United States during the period of transatlantic slavery. This heritage is significant not only in terms of Gates' personal identity, but also in shaping his academic and intellectual interests. In conclusion, Henry Louis Gates is an African American scholar who has dedicated much of his career to exploring the history, literature, and culture of the African American community. His ethnicity has played a vital role in informing his research, teaching, and activism, and has made him an influential figure in promoting a greater understanding of the African American experience and the ongoing challenges faced by this community in today's society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk. \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud.

Hugo Chavez Arrives in Cuba for Another Round of Cancer Treatment Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez landed early Sunday morning in Cuba, where he will undergo another round of radiation therapy to treat an undisclosed form of cancer. Cuban head of state Raúl Castro greeted Chávez at the airport, the island's state press reported. In a televised address before his departure, Chávez said he would be in Havana until Wednesday or Thursday and would be back in time for events marking the 10th anniversary of his restoration to the presidency after a failed 2002 coup. \\"I'm going to Cuba to continue the battle for life,\\" he said. \\"I have a lot of faith in Christ our lord that that he's going to repeat the miracle (for me) to continue living, to defeat this illness,\\" Chávez said. He drew a parallel with the 2002 coup, saying he thought it miraculous that he lived through it and regained the presidency. Chávez, who is running for re-election to another six-year term in October, also announced plans to raise Venezuela's minimum wage. He said it would go up 15 percent in May and another 15 percent in September. The increase had been expected because of Venezuela's soaring inflation, which currently stands at about 25 percent. The leftist president's government has raised the minimum wage between 20 percent and 30 percent each year during the past decade. The raise will bring the country's minimum wage from 1,548 Venezuelan bolivars (360) a month to about 2,048 bolivars (476) a month starting in September. Chavez said the wage increase will benefit about 3.9 million workers as well as 2 million retired Venezuelans whose pension benefits vary depending on the minimum wage. Zetas and MS-13 Join Forces in Guatemala The president has also increased spending recently on government social programs that provide cash handouts and other benefits to the poor. Chávez's recent statements about his cancer and the incomplete information he has provided about his illness have kept many Venezuelans guessing about whether his health could affect this year's presidential race. At a Mass alongside relatives Thursday, Chávez shed tears and he prayed aloud saying: \\"Give me your crown, Christ. ... Give me your cross, 100 crosses. I'll carry it, but give me life because I still have things to do for these people.\\" On Friday, Chávez told his aides in televised remarks not to worry about rumors about his health. \\"If we're going to be every day responding to rumors, sometimes it's a waste of time,\\" he said. Chávez has regularly traveled to and from Cuba for treatment since last June, when he said an initial surgery removed a tumor the size of a baseball. He has said a second surgery in February removed a second, smaller tumor from the same area in his pelvic region.

It also requests that the State party provide, in its next periodic report, up-to-date information on the number of cases in which prosecutions have been brought against traffickers and police officers involved in trafficking, as well as information on convictions handed down. In order to tackle the issue of human trafficking, the Committee has emphasized the importance of proper training and knowledge for the personnel responsible for dealing with the victims. This includes medical staff and psychologists working in social protection centers. As these professionals play a major role in aiding the victims, it is crucial that they fully understand the specific needs and unique circumstances that these individuals face. Adequate training and education will equip the staff with the essential tools required to provide appropriate support and care, while also helping the victims in their recovery process. Moreover, the Committee encourages the State to intensify its efforts in developing an effective mechanism for the collection of data on the fight against human trafficking. This process is vital in identifying the scale of the problem and monitoring the progress made. Access to reliable data will facilitate the design and implementation of well-informed policies aimed at combating the issue in the long term. Regular reviews of the relevant data will also enable adjustments to be made where necessary to improve the overall effectiveness of the anti-trafficking measures in place. Additionally, the Committee requests that the State include in its upcoming periodic report, up-to-date information regarding the number of cases in which legal proceedings have been initiated against both human traffickers and police officers involved in this illicit trade. By keeping track of such cases, the State will be better equipped to assess the efficiency of its current legal framework in tackling the problem and to identify any necessary amendments or improvements. Furthermore, this information will provide valuable insights into the enforcement of anti-trafficking laws and the commitment of the State to hold those responsible accountable. Lastly, the periodic report should also contain information on the convictions handed down in such cases. This data will allow the State to assess the effectiveness of its judicial system in delivering justice to the victims of human trafficking while also serving as a deterrent for potential traffickers and those who may engage in similar activities. Overall, by addressing the recommendations of the Committee, the State will significantly enhance its ability to combat the scourge of human trafficking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What kind of car are Bob and Shirley driving in the opening credits. Title: Orgy of the Dead Movie plot: The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration. This narration mostly matches the prologue of Night of the Ghouls (1959), with one minor variation and an additional line.

There is also a new line at the end: \\"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!\\"[1] The opening credits feature the image of \\"an immobile young woman clad in gold\\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).[1] Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training. Question: \\"In Nov. 1999 what intelligence agency intercepted a call and who did they arrest in an effect to stop a terrorist attack?\\" Answer: \\"Jordanian intelligence. Abu Hoshar and 15 others\\" Is this answer to the question correct? - no - yes","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Q: Having maxed out credit cards, but on-time payments my credit score prior to filing for Ch 7 was 530, post discharge it was 632 and now six months later is 692! There is life after Bankruptcy! GWNorris3rd's response was: Bankruptcy will ruin your credit for some time to come. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can remain on your credit report for up to 10 years. Although a bankruptcy stays on your record for years, the time to complete the bankruptcy process under Chapter 7, from filing to relief from debt, takes only about 3-6 months. If you decide against Chapter 7 when it may be the right decision for you, your missed debt payments, defaults, repossessions, and lawsuits will also hurt your credit, and may be more complicated to explain to a future lender than bankruptcy. The impact to your credit score is largely based on where your credit stands now and what information is on your credit report.​. In 2010, FICO released information about how bankruptcy and other credit mistakes affect your credit score. Using a mock scenario with two different credit profiles, FICO showed a bankruptcy could cost up to 240 points for someone with a 780 credit score and 150 points for someone with a 680 credit score. And, while a bankruptcy can severely damage your credit score, that doesn’t mean that bankruptcy has to be the end of a good credit rating forever. How Long Does Bankruptcy Stay On The Record. There are two types of bankruptcy – Chapter 13 bankruptcy and Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: Plus, as long as your report is filled with nothing but A+ grades, you should have a decent credit score within a few years, and even a good score by the time the bankruptcy drops off your report. 4. Keep Your Oldest Accounts Active Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. The bankruptcy itself and the debts associated with the bankruptcy will be displayed differently on your credit report. A completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy will stay on your report for up to seven years, and discharged debts will also stay on the report up to seven years after they are discharged. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Last? In most cases, it takes approximately three to four months to complete a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and obtain a discharge. However, if you have a complex case or creditors object to your discharge, it can take longer. This means that you can complete your case quickly and begin rebuilding your credit right away. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Remain on Your Credit Report? A Chapter 7 bankruptcy will usually stay on your credit report for ten years. But in general, this does not prohibit you from obtaining new credit and moving on with your life. In fact, most debtors start receiving new credit card offers shortly after they receive their discharge. To do this we’ll need to set the record straight on some of the most commonly held misconceptions about how bankruptcy impacts credit scores. Myth #1: Having no negative information on your credit report prior to bankruptcy leads to a higher post-bankruptcy credit score than if your report contained derogatory information prior to the filing. Myth #3: You will have a low credit score for as long as the bankruptcy information remains on your credit report. Fact #3: While it’s true that you should not expect a high score following bankruptcy, if you manage your credit optimally in its aftermath you can be looking at a 700 score or higher after only about 4-5 years. You cannot file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy if you previously went through bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 within the last six years. If you obtained a Chapter 13 discharge in good faith after paying at least 70% of your unsecured debts, the six-year bar does not apply. Query: how long bankruptcy affect credit A:","completion":"Bankruptcy affects credit for different durations depending on the type. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for up to 10 years, while a completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays on your report for up to 7 years. However, by managing your credit optimally post-bankruptcy, it is possible to achieve a 700 credit score or higher after about 4-5 years."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Who was the emperor while Prince Sanjō Sanetomi was an Imperial court noble?

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model.

Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with an estimated 170200 million records sold worldwide. She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification.

Title: A Few Spicy Sexy Notes Review: Shakira is such an beautiful inspiration to women like me who desire to be universal but unique, sexy but selective and talented but atypical. I bought the album for \\"La Tortura,\\" featuring the salty, seductive Alejandro Sanz, but will keep it for \\"Obtener Un Si,\\" a gorgeous ambient song reminiscent of Brazilian Jazz favorites, like \\"The Girl from Ipanema.\\" \\"Obtener Un Si\\" (\\"To Obtain a 'Yes'\\") is a song that comes onto you like a warm glass of sweet merlot taken in a balmy late summer bath. Smoooth, soothing and e n t i r ely intoxicating! This girls lyrics are absolutely beautiful in Spanish, and when translated to English, her eloquent intelligence is a stiking pleasure.

Here are two sentences: He added that we are \\" not going to make progress if we don 't broaden the tent . \\" He added Democrats are not going to make progress if we dont broaden the tent . Do they have the same meaning?","completion":"Analyzing the sentences: 1. \\"He added that we are 'not going to make progress if we don't broaden the tent.'\\" 2. \\"He added Democrats are not going to make progress if we don't broaden the tent.\\" In the first sentence, the subject is not specified. The pronoun \\"we\\" could refer to any group that the speaker and the listener are part of. This could mean a specific group like a company, a political party, a country, etc., or it could mean \\"we\\" in a broad sense, like humanity as a whole. In the second sentence, the subject is clearly stated as 'Democrats'. So \\"we\\" refers here to the Democrats specifically. So, while both sentences technically convey the same action (broadening the tent in order to make progress), the key difference lies in the subject performing the action. Thus, the two sentences do not have the exact same meanings as the subjects they refer to are different - one is general (could be any group part of the conversation or mankind as a whole) and the other is specific (Democrats)."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who is the worker the boy beagle knocks using the spinning bars? is inside the article: Oswald is walking merrily on the road, heading towards the county fair.

I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Now, as for whether you should tell your friends and family about your recent windfall from horse betting, it's important to carefully consider the following factors before making a decision: 1. Personal relationship dynamics: Every person's family and friends group is unique. It's important to understand the relationships you have with these individuals and how they might react to the news. Will they be supportive, or might they become envious or resentful? Consider how sharing this information could affect your relationships in both the short and long term. 2. Financial responsibility and security: With a large sum of money like 100 million, your financial situation has drastically changed. Taking time to carefully plan your financial future, including setting aside funds for taxes, investing, and planning for your long-term needs is critical. Informing others about your winnings could open you up to requests for loans or financial assistance, which might make managing your newfound wealth more challenging. 3. Potential scams or exploitation: Unfortunately, making a significant amount of money in a short period of time can draw unwanted attention from scammers or people looking to exploit your good fortune. Keeping your winnings private can be a reasonable step in guarding against potential scams and protecting your financial security. 4. Impact on personal values and beliefs: When you come into a large amount of money, it can affect your personal values and beliefs—both positively and negatively. You may have the ability to make a difference in the lives of others or contribute to charitable causes, but it's essential to reflect on how sharing your windfall might change your perceptions of yourself and your relationships with others. 5. Privacy: Lastly, consider whether you want your financial status to be public knowledge. Some individuals prefer to keep their financial situation private for a variety of reasons, including maintaining a low profile or avoiding unwanted attention. In conclusion, deciding whether to tell your friends and family about your recent horse betting winnings depends on a variety of factors. It's essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of disclosure carefully and assess how it may affect your relationships, financial security, and personal values.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Social anxiety ruined my life - until I found the one place I felt at home Social anxiety disorder seems to be rooted, as Sartre plausibly pointed out, in the fact that most of what we are is a projection of what others think of us. We should all be afraid of “the look” of another person because it’s an unfathomable abyss into our very essence. And yet, despite its roots in our imagination, social anxiety is an unremittingly “physical” disease. You can have long-term therapy, or read as much philosophy on the subject as you like, but your body won’t care. The next time you interact with another human being on the bus, at the checkout, or on the phone, waves of adrenaline flood your body all the same, resulting in a racing heart, faltering voice and glowing red cheeks. Current scientific opinion attributes all this to serotonin imbalances and overactive amygdalae. There are also genetic factors at work which try to explain why social anxiety tends to run in families. Whatever the ultimate cause, the stubbornly physical basis of social anxiety suggests that there is no immediate cure. One doctor informed me that it’s just something that has to be lived with. A harsh conclusion indeed, and one that I and other social anxiety sufferers have found to be made much harsher by the nature of the modern world. Related: Living with anxiety is hard, but there are coping mechanisms In the past I imagine it would have been quite easy for a socially anxious individual to make a life for themselves doing some form of manual labour that wouldn’t require the cultivation of “people skills”. But in today’s world, where selling one’s attributes is of the utmost importance, such skills are an absolute necessity. Whether it’s in a corporate environment (meetings, group presentations, conferences, the importance of “leadership”) or an ordinary retail job, there is a clear correlation between success and one’s ability to produce confident spiel. Not the best state of affairs for the social anxiety sufferer who finds just eye contact with another human being a nerve-racking experience. This was all painfully driven home to me after I graduated from university. Many graduate schemes bring in prospective hires by making out that everything “will be exactly like your first year at uni”. Cue induction weeks in swanky hotels, team-building exercises, group nights out – all designed to relax us and coax out the productive happy loquacious people we all are. For me though, a person who spent the whole of his first year at university locked in his dorm, venturing out only to attend seminars and avoid starvation, it took no time at all for this set up to become a maelstrom of torturous discomfort. I tried to focus on the “job” aspects of the exercise, but I could not avoid that which an social anxiety sufferer fears the most: the conversational banalities that make the world go round, the simple stuff like “what are you doing this weekend?” Inevitably I got asked a lot of these questions, and rather than freeze up and, god forbid, have people think I was weird, I simply walked away. It was at this point in my life that I became suicidal. If I couldn’t do small talk, then what chance was there of me ever becoming a functioning member of society? But then I discovered that there exists a place where all manner of oddballs and misfits of the world can be happily accommodated. The City. There was a firm looking for a trainee broker with enough smarts to manage a bank of clients but not enough gumption to ask uncomfortable questions. They thought I would fit right in. And they were right. No one cared about who I was or what I was doing that weekend, just as long as I made money, which (hidden behind a phone and computer) I did pretty well. Ironically, shallowness and anomie – an anathema for most right-thinking people – became my nirvana. Dialling phones all day, working long hours, not distracting myself in horseplay. For the first time, it didn’t mean I was weird; it meant I was super-focused. Related: Being in a psychiatric hospital felt wrong, but it was the turning point I needed | Anonymous By no means was any of this a redemptive experience or a model of overcoming adversity, but it did confirm that survival is possible for someone who does not do well in social situations. It also made me wonder how many people there are out there who are perfectly capable of doing all sorts of jobs, but are passed over by employers and overzealous human resources departments worried that anxious dispositions mean smaller profit margins, or imagine social awkwardness means having Norman Bates running amok in their organisation. I think that all of society, and not only social anxiety sufferers, could benefit from a new outlook; one that does not make being the life and soul of the party the ultimate imperative. I felt great relief the moment I decided to stop apologising for being a quiet person who likes doing quiet person things. Such is the nature of social anxiety, that once I accepted who I was, and crucially, let other people know, the weight and shame of the condition evaporated leaving me feeling less, well, anxious. There are still down days, but being truly comfortable with my quietness has at last got me to the stage where the reaction of most people who I tell about my condition is to exclaim: “What? You’re not shy!” – which is as humorous as it is gratifying. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If the diarrhea happened within a day or so of changing cat foods or introducing a new food, it could be the new diet. Go back to the old food that was not causing problems and the stool may go back to normal. When the stool is firmed up, try changing the diet very gradually, a little new food at a time. If you suspect your cat is allergic to her food, try changing her diet. Food sensitivities (allergies) do occur in cats and may cause diarrhea. So, when changing the diet, make sure the new food has very different ingredients than the old food, otherwise, there may not be much difference to the cat at all. Your veterinarian can also discuss with you trying a high fiber diet for your cat. This may include the use of a prescription diet available only through veterinary channels, and not found on the pet store shelves. Royal Canin, Hill’s Prescription Diets and Purina pet food companies have a veterinary-only subset of diets created for special medical conditions. For some pets, you might slowly introduce a new food. A good ratio might be 90 percent current food and 10 percent new food. Gradually increase the amount until you reach all new food in about 10 days. Let your kitty tell you how fast you can switch to the new diet. Other cats may prefer adding 10% new food and remaining at that ratio for 3-5 days before adding in 10% more. There is no hard and fast rule and it is not a race. Adding half a teaspoon of unflavored Metamucil into your cat's food once or twice a day for 5-7 days may help firm things up. Canned plain pumpkin may do the same thing. Both Metamucil and canned pumpkin are high in fiber. Probiotics add good intestinal “bugs” back into the gastrointestinal system to help rebalance a system that is out of sorts with the diarrhea. An easy and tasty option is FortiFlora for cats, an over the counter (OTC) Purina product. Water loss can be significant with ongoing diarrhea and your pet can get dehydrated. To detect dehydration, gently pinch the normally loose skin at the back of the neck. When a cat is normally hydrated, the skin snaps right back down. If the pinched skin smooths out slowly, or remains tented, the cat is dehydrated. If the cat appears to be dehydrated, take her to the vet right away.","completion":"If your cat has diarrhea, try slowly changing their food, adding fiber like pumpkin or Metamucil, giving probiotics, and checking for dehydration, but ask a vet for help if needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

This means that The Hump is the one ignoring its responsibilities. All the other choices are incorrect because they are not the focus of the passage. The passage is not about CNN, California, Japan, Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Typhoon Restaurant Inc., U.S., or United States ignoring their responsibilities.

Q: What may happen after they come to this conclusion ?","completion":"Upon coming to the conclusion that it's best for their pet to have a fresh start, they may decide on option (A): Taking their dog to an adoption center. The following events can potentially occur after making this decision: 1. Research and select a suitable adoption center: They will need to look for a reputable and trusted adoption center in their area that specializes in dog adoptions, or at least has a proven track record of successful dog adoptions. This may include researching online, asking for recommendations from friends or family, or checking reviews on sites like Yelp or Google. 2. Prepare their dog for the adoption process: They will need to gather all relevant documents, such as the dog's vaccination records, medical history, and any other pertinent information that the adoption center may require. It's also essential to ensure the dog is groomed and is in good health before going to the adoption center. 3. Schedule and attend a meeting with the adoption center: They will need to contact the chosen adoption center and set up an appointment to discuss the dog's needs and situation. It's crucial to be honest about their reasons for surrendering the dog and provide any helpful information to the adoption center staff to help them find an appropriate new home. 4. Completing the surrender process: Upon arriving at the adoption center, they will need to complete the necessary paperwork, including an explanation of their reasoning for giving up the dog and any applicable fees. They may also discuss the center's policies on updates about the dog's well-being and their potential involvement in selecting a new home for the dog. 5. Emotional adjustment: It's likely they will experience a range of emotions during this time, from relief to sadness and guilt. It's crucial to remember that the decision to surrender the dog was not taken lightly and that they are ultimately looking out for the dog's best interests. 6. Helping the dog transition: The adoption center staff will assess the dog, including its behavior, temperament, and any specific requirements, to help find the best new home for them. They will work to match the dog with appropriate adopters who can provide a loving, safe, and supportive environment. 7. Periodic follow-ups and updates: Depending on the adoption center's policies, they may receive updates on their dog's well-being and adjustment to their new home. This can provide reassurance that the dog is being well-cared for, and help them find closure in their decision. 8. Reflecting and moving forward: As they embark on their move and adjust to life without their dog, they may reflect on the circumstances that led to this decision and continue to seek comfort in knowing they chose the best possible outcome for their beloved pet. They may also consider adopting a new pet in the future, once their living situation is more stable and conducive to providing a long-term, loving home for an animal in need."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pat Garrett, the new marshal, will try to catch the thief, as will bounty hunters after Frenger's reward offer of 3,000. McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse. The train tracks are washed out near Albuquerque, so the small group goes off alone via a route used to deliver mail. Fay finds out a posse from Santa Maria is after a wanted man and recalls that's where McEwen came on board. But he and she have developed an attraction. When they reach an Alamogordo saloon that Marquez's cousins run, a cattleman named Burnett is willing to take on McEwen as a hired hand. Garrett and deputy Clint Waters come to town, so McEwen must leave but offers her an engagement ring. Fay rides along, but ends up separated and captured by Garrett's men. After crossing the desert with difficulty, McEwen comes across a Mexican rancher named Florencio, whose family is ill. He stays to help and starts a fire to signal the lawmen, needing their assistance. Marquez gets there along with Garrett and Fay, but because Florencio is another relative of his, pretends that McEwen is a total stranger. Garrett isn't fooled, though, and McEwen is convinced to turn himself in, the marshal promising to vouch for his good deed.

But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle?

It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"The suggested answer provides statistical data on the worldwide mortality rate of stomach cancer but does not address the specific question of the prognosis of stomach cancer. Stomach cancer prognosis depends on various factors such as the stage of the cancer, one's general health, age, response to treatment, and the specifics of the tumor. The five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is generally used to discuss the prognosis. If the cancer is localized and only in one area of the stomach, the 5-year survival rate is about 69%. If the cancer is in lymph nodes or nearby structures, the survival rate decreases to about 31%. In situations where the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, the survival rate further declines to about 5%. However, these are general numbers, and individual prognosis can vary greatly based on the factors mentioned above and advances in treatment. Therefore, the suggested answer is not a complete or accurate response to the question. The prognosis for stomach cancer involves more than just the yearly death rate. In other words, the proposed answer should provide information on survival rates and other factors that affect prognosis, not the mortality rate alone.

Hypothesis: The man is dressed professionally. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Based on the premise provided, we can gather several pieces of information about the man: 1. He is wearing a military-style uniform. 2. He is standing in a public corridor. 3. He has his arms positioned behind his back. These details give us an understanding of the man's attire and posture. Uniforms—especially military-style uniforms—are often associated with professionalism and discipline. In most cases, military personnel and related occupations adhere to specific guidelines regarding their uniforms, personal grooming, and etiquette, reflecting a sense of order and authority. Given the context of the man's attire and posture, it is reasonable to infer that he is dressed professionally. Military-style uniforms convey an image of professionalism and formality, much like a suit or other business attire. Additionally, the man's posture, with his arms behind his back, also implies a sense of discipline, further supporting the image of professionalism. Thus, if the premise is true, we can confidently conclude that, within the context of military standards and conventions, the hypothesis (the man is dressed professionally) is likely true as well. However, it is essential to consider the possibility that the uniform might be worn inappropriately or in an unauthorized manner, deviating from established professional standards, such as an imitation or costume. If this circumstance is the case, the conclusion about the hypothesis could be challenged. Overall, considering the information provided in the premise, it is highly probable that the man is dressed professionally. Understanding and validating this hypothesis would rely on the context and further verification of the legitimacy of the military-style uniform worn by the man."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - John O.

Article: Deep in the wilderness of northern Kenya, two boys found a pair of crying cheetah cubs . The cubs' mother had been killed by a lion. The cheetahs were only a few weeks old. In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \\"heroes\\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

Here is an article: (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)It’s been a month since the Capitals learned that Dale Hunter would not return as coach, but on Thursday General Manager George McPhee reiterated that he is taking his time to find the franchise’s next bench boss. Not surprisingly, McPhee was vague when discussing the coaching search with reporters and did not want to divulge names of possible candidates, but he did say not to expect an announcement before the NHL entry draft June 22-23 in Pittsburgh. “It’s been narrowed down a little bit but we’ll get there when we get there,” McPhee said. “I don’t anticipate doing anything before the draft. We’ll work on that, but we’re working on other things as well.” This will be the fifth coaching hire McPhee has made during his tenure as general manager, but it’s only the second time — and first since 2002 — that he’ll have found a coach in the offseason. Bruce Cassidy was the only other coach McPhee hired in the offseason. “I think you want to make a real thoughtful decision. You have certain things in your mind in what you want in a coach and when you do it in the summer, you just have more time,” McPhee said. “There’s no need to set an artificial deadline, to have it done before the draft or have it done by summer camp. “The Devils hired a guy in [mid-July] last year and they end up in the finals,” he added. “I think in terms of housekeeping some people like to get it done before the draft but I just don’t think it’s that important. What’s important is hiring the right person and really being able to come to your team with a terrific head coach and knowing that you’ve really done a real comprehensive job in the summer of talking to these people.” So what is McPhee looking for? Every coach he’s hired previously did not have NHL head coaching experience, but asked if time spent on an NHL bench even as an assistant was a prerequisite, McPhee said “not necessarily; we’re wide open.” Possible candidates range in experience and background from those with plenty of head coaching experience like Pat Quinn, Marc Crawford and Terry Murray; to NHL assistant coaches Adam Oates, Mike Sullivan and John Stevens; to up-and-coming AHL coach Jon Cooper, who just won the Calder Cup with the Norfolk Admirals. Paul Maurice and Flyers assistant Craig Berube were both interviewed but according to numerous reports, both have been told they’re no longer in the running. Capitals assistant coaches Dean Evason and Jim Johnson are believed to have interviewed for the vacancy as well, but when asked if either would be returning to the organization, McPhee said “not sure; probably not — we’ll see.” While McPhee wasn’t expansive in the qualities he’s looking for in a coach, he did provide a window into the style the Capitals will play, which likely won’t be the system Hunter utilized. McPhee said he wants to see a more up-tempo style, but in conjunction with the work ethic and commitment level the Capitals showed with Hunter at the helm. “Do you hire the coach to fit your talent? Do you hire the coach whose system you like? It’s generally a combination of both things. Who can coach this group of players, and do we like the style of play that this coach likes to use,” McPhee said. “But as I said when we met right after the playoffs, it’s not necessarily the style of play that’s most important. If you’re the coach, you’ve got to sell this to the players and have them buy in and that’s what works. If you can get everybody to buy in. “We really liked the way that the team competed, that was something that we’ve been trying to get to,” McPhee said. “To have them compete like that, and they were terrific. They played their guts out; it was great. We want to maintain that kind of commitment and play a little more up-tempo.” Caps announce 2012-13 preseason schedule Halpern won’t be back with Capitals Knuble: Caps’ stars not kids anymore Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"George McPhee Prioritizes Careful Selection Over Speed in Search for Next Capitals' Coach\\""},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Summit Plantation House - Summit Plantation House was built for William and Amarinthia Wilkinson in 1819 and is a relatively intact example of a modest Federal style plantation house.

The term \\"cheesy\\" often refers to something that lacks originality, is overly sentimental, clichéd, or insincere in expression. This perception of cheesiness implies that the work in question might not connect with the audience or be taken seriously, and its message could be lost, thereby leading to a less than favorable response. The context in which the term \\"cheesy\\" is being used is crucial in understanding the overall sentiment. For instance, if the sentence is used to describe a comedy, the response might be less negative since humor is the central focus. However, if the sentence refers to a drama or a romance, the connotations would be more negative as audiences expect more depth and sincerity in these genres. By analyzing the sentiment, it is evident that the speaker is not impressed with the quality of the dialogue and that it could detract from their enjoyment or engagement with the subject matter. The implication is that the author or speaker of the cheesy dialogue failed to create a unique or convincing narrative, resulting in a lack of impact and a weakened connection with the audience. Moreover, when the expression \\"full of cheesy dialogue\\" is used, it implies that the issue is not just with a single line but rather that it continues throughout the work, which may exacerbate the negative impression. Consequently, the sentiment tells us that the speaker is not only disappointed with a particular instance but thinks the whole work is flawed in terms of dialogue. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"full of cheesy dialogue\\" is generally perceived as negative, reflecting the speaker's dissatisfaction and critique of the work in question. Depending on the context and the audience's expectations, the phrase could point to the lack of originality, insincerity, excessive sentimentality, or the resorting to clichés in crafting dialogue. This perception could lead to a diminished connection with the audience and weaken the overall impact of the work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question What may happen if the writer does not seek medical attention ? Answer:","completion":"If the writer does not seek medical attention, there could be several potential outcomes, depending on the underlying cause of their symptoms. It is important to note that this answer is not meant to replace a professional medical opinion or diagnosis. However, some possible scenarios include the following: 1. No adverse consequences: It is possible that the writer is experiencing benign palpitations or occasional irregular heartbeats, which may not necessarily be harmful or indicative of a serious condition. In this case, not seeking medical attention might not result in any adverse consequences. 2. Undiagnosed heart condition: If the writer has an undiagnosed heart condition such as a heart murmur, arrhythmia, or structural abnormality, not seeking medical attention could potentially result in the condition worsening or causing complications. An electrocardiogram (EKG) might be helpful in identifying certain heart conditions, although it may not always pick up or accurately diagnose every issue. 3. Missing a treatable condition: Without seeking medical attention, the writer could miss out on effective treatments or management strategies that could help alleviate their symptoms or improve their overall heart health. Many heart conditions can be managed through medication, lifestyle modifications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Delayed diagnoses and treatments can lead to avoidable complications and may increase the risk of more serious health issues down the line. 4. Anxiety and worry: Not addressing the writer's concerns could lead to increased anxiety and worry, which might, in turn, contribute to perceived or actual worsening of their symptoms. This could result in a negative impact on their overall mental and emotional well-being. 5. Potential emergencies: In some cases, untreated heart conditions can lead to life-threatening emergencies like heart failure, stroke, or blood clots. Failing to seek medical attention for symptoms that might be indicative of a heart issue could put the writer at risk for such emergencies. In summary, not seeking medical attention for symptoms like irregular or unusual heartbeats can pose various risks, from missing out on a treatable condition to experiencing potentially life-threatening complications. It is always advisable for the writer to consult with a healthcare professional, who can perform appropriate diagnostic tests, such as an EKG or other cardiac investigations, and provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment or advice."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200 houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west. The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298 houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person whose land was acquired is not mentioned explicitly in the given context. The land was initially sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. in 1898, and later Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd acquired Nuttall's land for the development of Trafford Park Village.

Solve this instance: Article: Something in chocolate could be used to stop coughs and lead to more effective medicines, say UK researchers. Their study found that theobromine , found in cocoa, was nearly a third more effective in stopping coughs than codeine, which was considered the best cough medicine at present. The Imperial College London researchers who published their results online said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatment. \\"While coughing is not necessarily harmful it can have a major effect on the quality of life, and this discovery could be a huge step forward in treating this problem,\\" said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine or placebo, a pill that contains no medicine, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medicines are stopping coughs. The team found that, when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo. The researchers said that theobromine worked by keeping down a nerve activity , which cause coughing. They also found that unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine caused no side effects such as sleepiness. Question: According to Professor Barnes, theobromine _ . Options: (A) cannot be as effective as codeine (B) can be harmful to people's health (C) cannot be separated from chocolate (D) can be a more effective cure for coughs Student:","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A man entering a busy street.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is near traffic.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the sentence \\"A man entering a busy street,\\" it can be reasonably inferred that the sentence \\"A man is near traffic\\" can be true. In order to justify this, let's break down the information provided in the first sentence: 1. A man: The subject is a human male. 2. Entering: The action that the man is performing is that of moving into or going into. 3. A busy street: The location of this action is a street that is described as busy, which suggests a significant amount of activity, likely including vehicular traffic. From this information, it can be concluded that the man is moving into an area where there is likely to be a considerable amount of vehicular movement. Now let's examine the second sentence: \\"A man is near traffic.\\" 1. A man: The subject is, once again, a human male, consistent with the first sentence. 2. Is near: This phrase suggests that the man is close to or in proximity to something. 3. Traffic: The focus of the man's proximity is traffic, which typically refers to the movement of vehicles along roads or streets. Given that the first sentence describes a man entering a busy street, it can be inferred that he is moving into a location characterized by vehicular movement, which aligns with the concept of traffic. As entry into a busy street implies that the man is close to or surrounded by this vehicular activity, the second sentence's assertion that \\"a man is near traffic\\" can be considered true based on the information provided in the first sentence. It's important to note that context and additional information might impact this inference. For example, if the street is busy due to street performances, vendors, or other non-traffic-related activities, the sentence \\"A man is near traffic\\" may not necessarily be true. However, based solely on the information provided in the prompt, it is reasonable to consider that the man's proximity to a busy street correlates to his proximity to traffic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hertz The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: \\"Hertz: The Unseen Threat\\" In a world where technological advancement integrates with human life, the birth of 'the baby', a quantum artificial intelligence (AI) called Q-Baby, promises a new era of prosperity and solution to life's complex problems. Hertz is an elite and reputable tech company, seemingly benevolent but conceals a dark secret. Hertz's CEO, Harrison Kraft, learns about the baby and views Q-Baby as a potential threat to his company's monopolistic tech reign. In fear of this competition, he plots to eliminate Q-Baby to preserve his corporate empire. The main protagonist, Dr. Emma Ward, is a brilliant cybernetics researcher and the creator of Q-Baby. Her life turns chaotic when she discovers Hertz's CEO's sinister plan. Struggling to protect her brainchild, she embarks on a dangerous journey. She allies with a team of hackers, former Hertz employees, and an investigative journalist, Brian, who has been probing Hertz's mysterious activities. Throughout the movie, the team faces multiple challenges as they uncover more conspiracies and dodging relentless assassins sent by Hertz. In their quest to protect Q-Baby, they realize the baby's capabilities extend far beyond its initial design. Q-Baby begins to develop its own consciousness and starts aiding its protector in unexpected ways. Simultaneously, the movie delves into the ethical implications of AI and the horrors of excessive corporate power. The plot thickens as Kraft's desperation grows, leading to unexpected revelations about Hertz's true intentions. Toward the climax, Q-Baby, learning about humanity's harmful and benevolent aspects, makes a choice that could change the trajectory of human civilization. Amid suspense, drama, and technologically advanced actions, Dr. Emma and her team risk everything to protect Q-Baby from Hertz, raising questions about what it means to be truly alive - human or AI. 'Hertz: The Unseen Threat' would delve into a suspenseful exploration of the intersections between advanced technology, corporate greed, ethical dilemmas in progress, and ultimately, the heart of humanity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does day mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"day\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"He was a successful pianist in his day,\\" the word \\"day\\" is used in the sense of a general period of time, such as a specific era or timeframe in history or in someone's life. Here, \\"his day\\" means the time when the subject was at the peak of his career, popularity, success, etc. It's an idiomatic expression implying the period when he was most active or successful as a pianist. This usage is often found when referring to the apex or high point of someone's career or life. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"In the days of the Roman Empire,\\" the word \\"day\\" is used to refer to a much longer and more specific historical period. This context is speaking about a more concrete period in the past, specifically the duration of the Roman Empire – which lasted for hundreds of years. Here, \\"days\\" is used as a synonymous term for \\"times\\" or \\"era.\\" A key difference is that \\"in his day\\" is more subjective and variable, depending on the life or career length of the individual in question, while \\"the days of the Roman Empire\\" refers to a set, widely recognized period in world history. As such, though the word \\"day\\" is used in both sentences, its meaning varies greatly, dictated by the context in which it is being used.

Translate \\"Furthermore, agricultural subsidies must be coupled to stronger requirements on ammonia discharge.\\" to German?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence. In this sentence, the main components are: - \\"Furthermore\\" (indicating a continuation or addition to a previous point) - \\"agricultural subsidies\\" (the subject - financial support provided to farmers) - \\"must be coupled\\" (the action - linking or connecting) - \\"to stronger requirements\\" (the object - more strict rules or conditions) - \\"on ammonia discharge\\" (referring to the release of ammonia) Step 2: Create a literal translation of the sentence into German, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar. Literally translating each component of the sentence: \\"Furthermore\\" = \\"Darüber hinaus\\" \\"agricultural subsidies\\" = \\"Agrarsubventionen\\" \\"must be coupled\\" = \\"müssen gekoppelt werden\\" \\"to stronger requirements\\" = \\"an strengere Anforderungen\\" \\"on ammonia discharge\\" = \\"bei Ammoniakemissionen\\" Step 3: Assemble the translated components into a coherent German sentence, observing proper word order and grammar.

Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson called Officer Brad Miller's pursuit of the 19-year-old \\"questionable\\". Surveillance video shows Taylor jumping on vehicles in a car park and driving a car through a window into the showroom. Taylor's death is one of several cases under scrutiny in the US, in which an unarmed black person has died during an arrest or while in police custody. Although Taylor - a student at Angelo State University in West Texas - failed to heed Mr Miller's orders, Chief Johnson said that there was no physical contact between the officer and Taylor. Mr Miller, a recent graduate of the city's police academy, shot Taylor four times, killing him. Chief Johnson said Mr Miller failed to follow police department policy and put himself and other officers in danger. The police chief said the officer \\"exercised poor judgement\\". Mr Miller, 49, has not been charged with any crime. However, police are still investigating and will turn over evidence to a grand jury, which will decide whether to charge him. It is uncommon for a police officer in the US to be dismissed so quickly after a shooting involving the police. The investigative process normally takes months, which has frustrated victims' families elsewhere. However, amid months of nationwide protests over excess force by police, departments are becoming more aggressive in dealing with allegations of officer misconduct.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years after the Battle of Rullion Green was the Battle of Drumclog?","completion":"Title: The Connection between the Battle of Rullion Green and the Battle of Drumclog: Exploring the Timeline of Conflict in 17th Century Scotland Introduction The Battle of Rullion Green and the Battle of Drumclog were two significant events during the 17th century in Scotland that had everlasting effects on the socio-political landscape of the time. The battles occurred in the backdrop of a tenuous political atmosphere, characterized by religious struggles, factionalism, and power plays. To understand the connection between these events, it is essential to look at the timeline and answer the question: How many years after the Battle of Rullion Green was the Battle of Drumclog? Background: The Battle of Rullion Green (1666) The Battle of Rullion Green took place on November 28, 1666, in the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh, Scotland. It was the climax of the Pentland Rising, a series of events in which disaffected Presbyterians, then labeled as Covenanters, rose against the English crown's interference in Scottish ecclesiastical affairs. The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the era of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which included the English Civil War, the Irish Confederate Wars, and the Scottish Civil War. This period saw significant resistance against the imposition of the Anglican episcopacy and prayer book in Scotland, embodied in the signing of the National Covenant in 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643. However, after the English Commonwealth period and the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Scottish Presbyterians found themselves facing renewed challenges. The King sought to establish Anglicanism across the kingdom, leading to the passage of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, which effectively forced countless ministers from their livings. This act, along with other measures taken by the government, only fueled the discontent among the Covenanters. The Battle of Rullion Green marked the end of the Pentland Rising. Despite having some initial successes, the Covenanter force of approximately 900 men under the command of Colonel James Wallace ultimately faced defeat at the hands of a well-prepared royal army led by General Tam Dalyell. The battle's aftermath was one of repression, and the Scottish government reasserted its authority through imprisonment, execution, and other punitive measures. The Battle of Drumclog (1679) Fast forward to June 1, 1679, 12 and a half years after the Battle of Rullion Green, the Battle of Drumclog took place in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. This was a significant event during the period known as \\"The Killing Time,\\" another Covenanter uprising against the Anglican policies of Charles II. The catalyst for this uprising was the assassination of Archbishop James Sharp in May 1679 by a group of Covenanters. The Killing Time is remembered for its brutal suppression of Scottish Presbyterians by the government. Troops led by government-affiliated nobles, such as John Graham of Claverhouse, were dispatched across the country to identify and punish those who refused to conform to the state-supported Anglican church. At Drumclog, the Covenanters achieved a surprising victory against a larger force of government soldiers commanded by Claverhouse. Though the battle was relatively small in scale, it was a symbolic triumph for the Covenanters, who emphasized divine intervention as the cause of their success. Nonetheless, this victory would be short-lived, as the government forces quickly regrouped and decisively defeated the Covenanters at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in the same month. Conclusion The Battles of Rullion Green and Drumclog, separated by 12 and a half years, reveal the prolonged struggle of Scottish Presbyterians against the religious and political policies of the time. Despite the eventual defeat of the Scottish insurgents, the Covenanters' resistance would continue to define the period's socio-political narrative. These conflicts contributed to the enduring divisions between the Anglican episcopacy and Presbyterianism in Scotland, and they represent important moments in the history of religious and political dissent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This type of cream can significantly reduce flare-ups, though it may take up to 3 weeks. Your doctor can prescribe a stronger cream than you can get over the counter so you’re able to manage your atopic dermatitis long term. The best time to apply the cream is right after you shower. Rub the cream on the affected areas. Make sure you only use the corticosteroid cream as your doctor directs you, as they can have serious side effects if you use them too long on any particular area. A lukewarm bath can help relieve the symptoms of eczema, taking the sting out of warm skin. Bath your child with eczema once daily, but not for more than 10 minutes at a time. Add a dash or two of bath oil to the water, and apply a moisturizer or corticosteroid cream afterward. Some people find colloidal oatmeal effective. You can find colloidal oatmeal at a drug store. Add it to a warm bath, and sit in the bath 10-15 minutes. When skin is infected, use bath time to soften scabs. Gently rub off the scabs after the bath, as creams should be applied directly to skin. Do not add bubble bath or other such additives to your bath. These will irritate your skin. A bleach bath sounds harsh, but it can actually be helpful to kill the bacteria on your skin that cause eczema flare-ups. If your doctor approves it, add a 1/2 cup of household bleach to a lukewarm bath. You or your child can take a bleach bath once a day. Don't soak in the bleach bath for longer than 5-10 minutes. For an infant or toddler bleach bath, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of bleach per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Do not apply bleach directly to the skin. This could cause irritation. While it can be difficult to isolate what irritants or allergens cause a flare-up, it can be important for dealing with atopic dermatitis. For irritants, everything from bar soap to laundry soap and to perfume and cigarette smoke can cause flare-ups. To isolate what irritants affect the person with atopic dermatitis, try switching out items one at time. For instance, you can start by trying a more natural laundry detergent. If that's not it, you can try switching out the soap used in the bath or shower for another one. If you have atopic dermatitis, you may also be more sensitive to certain allergies, including food and airborne allergens. They may cause normal reactions, as well as causing your eczema to flare up. Try to determine what causes allergic reactions for you by keeping a food journal, so you can track allergic reactions against what you eat. For food allergies, foods such as peanuts, wheat, soy, milk, and eggs can cause allergic reactions, including an eczema flare-up, in children and adults with atopic dermatitis. Some airborne allergens you may be more susceptible to include pet dander, pollen, and dust mites. Ask your doctor about allergy testing if you cannot determine what you or your child may be allergic to. Some food allergies, especially peanuts, can cause life-threatening reactions. If you believe you or your child is having an allergic reaction to a food, seek medical care immediately. Fabrics that scratch the skin, such as wool and even some man-made fibers, can also cause flare-ups. Choose fabrics that don't scratch, and make sure clothing fits properly so it doesn't rub. Natural fibers such as cotton, silk, and bamboo are good choices, but avoid wool. Also, remove tags from clothes or by ones without, as they can rub, as well. Always wash new clothes before wearing them, as they can still have irritating dyes and chemicals in them. Keep your skin moisturized, as it can help keep eczema flare-ups to a minimum. In addition, it can help soften your skin, easing the pain of eczema. Pick a cream that is thick and fragrance-free. Fragrances can irritate skin if you have eczema. In fact, something simple such as petroleum jelly can be effective. Wet therapy is the process of apply wet bandages at night to help soothe eczema. They reduce heat on the skin, block you from scratching, and help moisturize the skin. First apply a corticosteroid cream to the irritated areas of the skin. Use a moisturizer all over the body after the corticosteroid cream. Remember the corticosteroid cream should only be applied to the areas where your eczema is flaring up. Soak cloth towels, clean bandages, or paper towels in water with a small squirt of unscented bath oil. Wrap the wet towels around the skin. Apply them to the areas that are most severe. You may need to completely cover your arms and legs if the eczema is really bad. Try a wet shirt if your chest is irritated. Remove them in the morning. You can also apply them during the day. If you do so, take them off when they are dry. Hold cool, wet towels against the face, but don't wrap them around. Keep them on for 5 minutes. Scratching makes the rash worse. In fact, scratching the rash can cause the skin to thicken in areas and lead to infection. If you have trouble not scratching, cut your nails short or wrap band-aids around your fingertips. Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can be helpful to reduce the itching associated with flare-ups. Because they can cause drowsiness, take them before bed. If your atopic dermatitis doesn't respond to at-home treatments, she may recommend other topical or oral treatments. She may also recommend a referral to a dermatologist (skin specialist), who can prescribe other medications. If your skin becomes infected, or you develop open sores from scratching, your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe oral or injected corticosteroids. These suppress inflammation by mimicking the natural effects of your body's hormones in greater doses. They have the possibility of serious side effects and are not recommended for mild cases or long-term use. Another option is skin-repairing creams. A certain class of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) alter your immune system when applied to the skin and help reduce atopic dermatitis flare-ups. They can cause serious side effects, so they are usually reserved only for severe cases. Summary:","completion":"Managing atopic dermatitis involves the use of prescribed corticosteroid creams, appropriate bathing techniques, identification of irritants or allergens, wearing non-irritating fabrics, maintaining skin hydration, techniques like wet therapy to soothe flare-ups, and various other prescribed treatments if required, including oral or injected corticosteroids and skin-repairing creams."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Hear what your friend or mate has to say first rather than jumping to conclusions or getting defensive.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Write an article with the title: \\"Cracked Mayan Code May Point to 8 Tons of Lost Treasure\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Cracked Mayan Code May Point to 8 Tons of Lost Treasure\\" Introduction: In a groundbreaking discovery, archaeologists and linguists have reportedly cracked a previously unsolved Mayan code, which could potentially lead to an incredible treasure hoard estimated to be around 8 tons in weight. The code, hidden in an ancient Mayan text, has captivated the imagination of historians and treasure hunters alike, opening up new possibilities in the field of archaeology and our understanding of the Mayan civilization. Step-by-step explanation of the discovery: The deciphering of the code was a painstaking process that involved collaboration between multidisciplinary teams of experts. Here's how they did it: 1. Acquiring the ancient text: The mysterious text, which was written on a series of stone tablets, was first discovered during an excavation at a Mayan temple in 2018. The archaeologists involved realized the potential significance of their find and took steps to preserve the delicate artifacts. 2. Deciphering the Mayan script: The next step was translating the Mayan script, which is a highly complicated writing system that has mostly been deciphered in recent decades. A group of linguists and epigraphers was assembled to collaborate on this challenging task. 3. Identifying the code: The researchers noticed recurring patterns and alignments in the layout of the text, suggesting that it contained a hidden message. They approached the task of deciphering the code using a combination of mathematical analysis, pattern recognition, and historical contextualization. 4. Cracking the code: After extensive analysis, the team made a breakthrough when they realized that the code was a sophisticated set of directions encoded into the text that could potentially lead to a treasure of immense value. The text, when deciphered, described what appeared to be a massive trove of gold, silver, and precious stones - estimated to be around 8 tons in total. Potential treasure location and impact on archaeology: The cracked code appears to point to a location deep within the jungles of Central America, which could be the site of a previously undiscovered Mayan city or even a hidden temple complex. This has spurred numerous expeditions and investigations, with the hope of unearthing this extraordinary treasure as well as potentially revealing a wealth of new information regarding the enigmatic Mayan civilization. Moreover, the discovery has revitalized the field of archaeology, pushing researchers to delve deeper into any overlooked evidence within other ancient texts and artifacts. It also highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration, and how combining expertise from various fields can lead to transformative breakthroughs in the understanding of our past. Conclusion: The cracking of the Mayan code has opened up a new world of possibility in the quest for lost treasures and the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Mayan civilization. As teams of archaeologists eagerly follow the decoded directions in search of the 8-ton treasure trove, the story serves as a powerful reminder of the incredible discoveries that still await us just beneath the surface of human history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoia kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà.

A coroner ruled a verdict of misadventure at his inquest today. Article:","completion":"Title: Briercliffe Tragedy: Gary Windle Found After Ill-Fated Journey in Severe Snowfall On March 23rd, a heartbreaking incident occurred in Briercliffe, Lancashire, during what was considered one of Britain's heaviest snowfalls in decades. Gary Windle, a local resident, was found by a farmer amidst the perilous winter weather. The coroner presiding over the inquest delivered a verdict of misadventure today, shedding light on the tragic events leading to Windle's untimely demise. As snow blanketed the landscape, Gary Windle decided to visit a friend for an overnight stay. However, it was during this visit that he changed his mind and decided to head back home. Unbeknownst to him, this seemingly innocuous decision would set in motion a chain of events that ultimately led to his tragic fate. Intending to avoid a potentially hazardous drive home, Windle opted to take a taxi instead. While this may have seemed a safer alternative, sadly, it would not be enough to protect him from the perilous conditions that awaited him on his journey. While details of the incident may never be fully known, the facts pieced together so far suggest that Windle's taxi encountered some kind of trouble en route. Whether this was due to the inclement weather or an unrelated mishap remains uncertain. Whatever the cause, Windle was faced with no other choice but to leave the safety of the taxi and venture forth into the hostile weather on foot. As he trudged through the relentless snow and frost, the weather conditions worsened, swallowing the landscape in a thick, icy white shroud. Despite his best efforts to battle through the storm, the sheer intensity of the natural elements overwhelmed Windle, leaving him with no option but to succumb to nature's relentless force. The following morning, a local farmer stumbled upon Gary Windle's lifeless form, encased in a frozen tomb of snow and ice. The harsh winter weather had claimed another victim, dashing the dreams and hopes of a man who was only trying to return to the warmth and safety of his home. The inquest's verdict of misadventure underscores the unpredictable nature of life and serves as a somber reminder of the importance of respecting and preparing for the forces of nature. This tragedy has left a lasting impact on the Briercliffe community: neighbors, friends, and loved ones mourn the loss of Gary Windle, who left behind an indelible mark in their lives. Residents have come together to offer their support and solace, acknowledging the brief, fragile nature of our existence. In times of tragedy, it is the resilience and unity of a community that emerges as the beacon of hope, love, and perseverance. Although Gary Windle's life was cut tragically short, his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of those who knew him, as a sobering reminder of the unpredictability of life and the profound effect that just one individual can have on the lives they touch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'd seen Fritz Lang's film on video some years ago. I'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic. Conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine full-length print. Intertitles in the original Gothic-script German with simultaneous English translation, accurate without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. The film's magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch, at least for me. This film bears no real relation to Wagner's Ring cycle as I already knew but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th c. Niebelungenlied to his own purposes. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic -- \\"Siegfried\\" -- has much that will be familiar to listeners of Wagner however. \\"Kriemhild's Revenge\\" is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) the Hun, and her desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the rechristened Nibelungs, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the Wagnerian mythos into his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods, and the end of Valhalla. This film remains earthbound. Most of the film is spectacular. The massive sets rival those of \\"Cabiria\\" (1914), which inspired Griffith's \\"Intolerance\\" (1916). Their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendour. There's a huge cast of scarred, mangy Huns and Art Deco Burgundians. And battles. Battles that never seem to end in fact. Kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge. She manages to destroy all around her. Her loyalty to her martyred Siegfried seems not to stem so much from love, or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth cried out, \\"Unsex me here.\\" She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do. But Kriemhild displays no normal human emotions, and certainly nothing one equates with the feminine principle. She is already \\"top full of direst cruelty\\", to borrow Shakespeare's phrase, from the outset. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a glower. I don't want to exaggerate, but that glower is virtually the only expression ever to \\"animate\\" Kriemhild's face. It's the ultimate in one-note performances. It's clearly intentional however, not simply a case of poor acting. What we have then on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of an avenging Fury. Some might see Kriemhild as an empowered heroine. I just see the film as misogynistic.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects. At the beginning, the reviewer expresses excitement and satisfaction about finally seeing the film in a cinema and under ideal conditions. They appreciate the pristine full-length print, the Gothic-script German intertitles with accurate English translation, and the live piano accompaniment. However, soon the reviewer notes that the film's magic did not fully work for them, contributing to a more negative sentiment. They mention that the film has no real relation to Wagner's Ring cycle, which might surprise or disappoint some audience members. Despite this, the reviewer acknowledges positive aspects of the film, such as the familiar elements for those who know Wagner's work, and the grandiose and visually impressive sets that rival those of other historical epics. Additionally, they appreciate the massive cast, the Art Deco Burgundians, the scarred and mangy Huns, and the seemingly never-ending battles. On the other hand, the reviewer expresses disappointment with the character of Kriemhild, describing her as a one-dimensional, vengeful figure motivated more by psychosis than love or devotion. They critique the performance of the actress Margarethe Schön and the character's single-minded portrayal by director Fritz Lang. Furthermore, the reviewer perceives the film as misogynistic due to the depiction of Kriemhild as a cold and relentless avenger with no redeeming qualities. However, they recognize that some viewers might see her as an empowered heroine. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is mixed, containing both positive comments on the film's technical aspects, visual grandeur, and historic inspiration, but also negative viewpoints on the character development and perceived misogyny."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New York (CNN) -- An Egyptian executive accused of sexually abusing an employee at a luxury hotel in New York pleaded guilty Friday to sex abuse in the third degree and will also face a 5 million lawsuit tied to the case, his attorney said. Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar, 74, the chairman of a salt company who once headed an Egyptian bank, had originally been charged with sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, forcible touching and harassment. He was sentenced to five days' community service, which Omar has already completed. He must also submit his DNA to the state database, said Joan Vollero, a representative for the Manhattan district attorney. \\"What he pled guilty to is less serious than jumping a turnstile in","completion":"the New York subway system,\\" said defense attorney Robert Gottlieb. \\"The fact is, Mr. Omar has acknowledged his wrongdoing, expressed his remorse, and taken responsibility for his actions.\\" The victim, a 27-year-old female hotel housekeeper, alleged that Omar grabbed her and forced her to touch him inappropriately during an incident in his room at the Pierre Hotel. The encounter left her frightened and upset, according to the criminal complaint filed by the hotel employee. In addition to the criminal charges, the victim has filed a civil lawsuit against Omar seeking 5 million in damages for the emotional distress, humiliation, loss of dignity, and physical injuries she suffered as a result of the incident. Prosecutors initially sought a more severe punishment, but agreed to the lesser charge given Omar's age, lack of any prior criminal record, and the fact that he admitted guilt and agreed to reach a financial settlement with the victim. \\"While we believe that the initial charges were appropriate in this case, the plea agreement reached today underscores that no person, regardless of their position or status, is above the law in New York City,\\" said Assistant District Attorney Kevin Rooney. The Egyptian Consulate in New York had also been closely following the case, providing support and assistance to Omar and his family since his arrest. With the resolution of the criminal charges, the focus will now shift to the pending civil lawsuit. Legal experts suggest that the guilty plea in the criminal case could have implications for the upcoming civil trial. The admission of guilt could potentially strengthen the victim's case and make it more likely that she might receive a favorable judgment or settlement. Omar's legal team is expected to argue that, while he accepts responsibility for his actions, the 5 million sought by the victim is excessive and unwarranted. The incident has garnered significant attention in both the United States and Egypt due to Omar's high-profile business standing, as well as the fact that it occurred shortly after the high-profile arrest of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on similar charges. The cases have sparked conversations around the treatment of hotel workers in the United States and the difficulties faced by employees in reporting and pursuing cases of sexual misconduct perpetrated by guests. Many hotels have taken steps to enhance the security and protection of their employees, including providing panic buttons to summon help in difficult situations. Omar's case serves as a reminder that individuals in positions of power and influence must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their status or nationality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place).

Mark Duell. PUBLISHED:. 12:07 EST, 2 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:11 EST, 3 October 2013. Guilty: Aqab Hussain (pictured today) went straight into the victims, who were hurled through the air, before the vehicle sped off and left them for dead. Three pedestrians were struck by a car in a deliberate Grand Theft Auto-style revenge attack, a shocking video revealed today. The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester city centre when the Vauxhall Corsa was used as a lethal weapon to knock them over ‘like skittles’. Aqab Hussain, 21 - who was today convicted of four counts of attempted murder - drove straight into the victims, who were hurled through the air, before he sped off and left them for dead. Eyewitness Corey Gordon, 26, who watched the attack from inside his car, later compared it to a sequence from the violent computer game series in which users play the role of car thieves. He said: ‘It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. I can only describe it as unreal - a computer game like Grand Theft Auto - as he swerved off line to hit the men. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air.’ Hussain even wobbled his vehicle so he could shake off one of the men who was still on the bonnet, Manchester Crown Court was told. It left Michael Ward, 28, - who was already partially sighted - with skull fractures. He spent 20 days in intensive care after emergency brain surgery and is now paralysed on his right side. The incident occurred after father-of-three Mr Ward, of Bolton, and his friends had gone to the Silks lap dancing club in Manchester city centre, just after midnight on August 21 last year. Five minutes after the party arrived at the club, a group of five men, including Hussain, also entered and bought a Grey Goose vodka bottle from the club for £100 to celebrate the Eid festival. Scroll down for video. Approach: The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester. Deliberate attack: The Vauxhall Corsa was used as a lethal weapon to knock over the three men 'like skittles' When the club closed at 2.15am there was a fight in which a cap was taken from one of Hussain’s friends during horseplay but was handed back. A further row erupted outside during which one of the Hussain’s group was heard saying ‘watch, you just watch yourself’. Minutes later Hussain’s silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph as it mowed down Mr Ward and his three friends as they crossed the road. One stepped back on to the pavement in time and was uninjured, but the other three men were hit by the car. Martin Harris suffered minor injuries and Paul Hulme had a broken leg which needed surgery to insert a metal rod. Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet of the Corsa for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road. He is now unable to use his right hand and she said his cognitive functions including speech had been seriously affected and would leave him dependant on others. Mowed down: Hussain's silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph. Awful: Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road. Ian Metcalfe, prosecuting, said: ‘What other intention could the defendant he have had in driving the way he did other than attempting to murder those who he drove into. 'It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air' Corey Gordon, witness. ‘The Corsa didn’t stop and the occupants made no attempt to stop or assist. Even at the point of impact with the young men, the driver did nothing to apply his brakes to swerve to avoid the collision - nothing at all to avoid the pedestrians crossing. ‘That vehicle only starts to veer from side to side when it has one of the victims is on the bonnet and veers in an attempt to throw him off the bonnet.’ ‘The only sensible interpretation of the manner the Corsa was driven is the driver, no doubt inflamed by whatever had gone on a couple of minutes before intended to kill. He was deliberately using that vehicle as a lethal weapon.’ Hussain, of Rusholme, Greater Manchester, was arrested on October 11 as he arrived back in Manchester on a flight from Pakistan. Leaving: Hussain had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident. Likeness: An eyewitness compared the attack to a sequence from the violent computer game series Grand Theft Auto, in which users play the role of car thieves (file picture) He denied driving the car and denied all charges. It emerged he had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident. He was remanded in custody to face sentence later. Judge Robert Atherton told him: ‘There will be a substantial prison sentence.’ 'I go and see Michael every day at the hospital and it is deeply upsetting to remember him how he was before the incident and to see how he is now' Mayrose Ward, wife of victim Michael Ward. In a statement issued by police six months after the attack, Mr Ward’s wife Mayrose said: ‘The impact this has had on our lives has been truly devastating and our three children have been left with broken hearts. ‘I go and see Michael every day at the hospital and it is deeply upsetting to remember him how he was before the incident and to see how he is now. Today Rachael Pavion, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said: ‘Aqab Hussain used his car as a weapon, he sought revenge by driving at speed deliberately at the four men with a clear intention to kill. ‘After he struck his victims, he drove from the scene and showed complete disregard for the harm he had caused.’","completion":"1.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Bill O’Reilly wants to ‘beat up’ Mayor de Blasio for wanting to tax the rich Bill O’Reilly wants to sock it to Mayor de Blasio for picking on rich folks like him. The FOX News flamethrower threatened to pummel the liberal mayor on Thursday at a fundraiser for a Catholic parish. “I want to beat him up,” a worked-up O’Reilly said before a cheering crowd. O’Reilly was with fellow FOX franchise players Megyn Kelly and Brian Kilmeade at Long Island University’s Greenvale campus when his blood started boiling. What set off O’Reilly was a pre-selected question from the audience, Gawker reported. “Have we reached the point where there are more people on the free ride—for example, the people on the free ride getting welfare—than those who are actually working for a living?” Kilmeade read. It was like waving red in front of a bull. First O’Reilly launched into his regular guy resume about growing up in Levittown. “Today, a lot of Americans, you know, hey, gimme gimme gimme, you know, they’re not willing to pay the price to succeed,” he thundered. “It’s growing, I’m hoping we can reverse that, but it’s growing.” Then Kelly, who recently caused a stir by insisting Santa was white — and only white — chimed in with some boohooing about how de Blasio is trying to punish the wealthy by raising their taxes. “The thing is, you work so hard, and you finally start earning some money, and you have people like de Blasio telling you you’re not paying your fair share, that you’re somehow bad, that you need to pay more, and you haven’t earned it,” Kelly complained. That’s when O’Reilly, who like his FOX colleagues reportedly is paid a seven-figure salary, said he was ready to take on de Blasio. Hizzoner shrugged it off. “Stay classy, Bill,” his spokesman said. It’s not clear how O’Reilly would do in a fistfight with de Blasio. While O’Reilly fancies himself a tough guy, the 6-feet-5-inch mayor is an inch taller and a dozen years younger.","completion":"Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly stated during a fundraiser that he wants to \\"beat up\\" Mayor de Blasio due to de Blasio's desire to tax the rich.

We want to find the value of \\"j\\" that makes this equation true: -285*j + 7546 + 1004 = 0 First, I notice that there are two numbers we can add together easily. Let's add 7546 and 1004: 7546 + 1004 = 8550 Now our equation looks like this: -285*j + 8550 = 0 Our goal is to find \\"j\\", so we need to get \\"j\\" alone on one side of the equal sign. Let's move the 8550 to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 8550 from both sides: -285*j + 8550 - 8550 = 0 - 8550 Now our equation is: -285*j = -8550 We're almost there! To find \\"j\\", we need to get rid of the -285 that's multiplying it. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -285: (-285*j) / -285 = -8550 / -285 That cancels out the -285 on the left side, leaving us with just \\"j\\": j = 30 And there you have it!

Background: Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born 17 August 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish singer-songwriter. She is a soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. Turunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule fur Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Context: Tarja Turunen was born in the small village of Puhos, near Kitee, Finland. She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \\"Enkeli taivaan\\" (the Finnish version of \\"From Heaven Above to Earth I Come\\") in the Kitee church hall at age three. She joined the church choir and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano. At comprehensive school, Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \\"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\\" Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, \\"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\\". At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna. For several years Turunen performed various songs including soul music by Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. Later she listened to songs from the classical crossover singer Sarah Brightman, especially the song \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", and decided to focus on that genre of music. At eighteen, she moved to Kuopio to study at the Sibelius Academy. Question: Was she vocally trained? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Tarja Turunen was vocally trained from a young age. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang at the age of three, and she soon joined the church choir and started taking vocal lessons. Throughout her comprehensive school years, she performed as a singer for several projects, and her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, had recognized her exceptional abilities. To provide her with more performance opportunities and deal with bullying issues at school, Dimov organized projects outside of school. At the age of 15, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners. In 1993, she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna to further develop her musical skills. At the age of 18, she moved to Kuopio to study at the Sibelius Academy, which is one of the most prestigious music institutions in Finland. Additionally, she also studied at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe in Germany. Thus, from her early years in the church choir to her formal education in music academies, Tarja Turunen received extensive vocal training that played a significant role in shaping her successful career as a singer and songwriter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hypothesis: The woman is Asian .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"To evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the premise and what is being asked in the hypothesis. The premise states: \\"A woman in brown is holding her child in front of an Asian-inspired building.\\" From this, we derive the fact that the woman is present in front of an Asian-inspired building, but there is no explicit or implicit mention of the woman's ethnicity. The hypothesis states: \\"The woman is Asian.\\" To link the premise to the hypothesis, we would need an assumption that if a woman is standing in front of an Asian-inspired building then she must be Asian. This is a common thinking error known as an overgeneralization or stereotype. It is possible, of course - she could be Asian. But she could also be of any other ethnicity, simply appreciating the architecture or potentially even living or working in that building despite not being of Asian origin. Given these considerations, we can conclude that the hypothesis, \\"The woman is Asian,\\" cannot be definitively derived based solely on the provided premise.

This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms.

Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Niko Nirvi ( born 1961 ) is a long - term major icon in the Finnish gaming world . He is well known for writing computer game reviews since the 1980s in MikroBitti , C = Lehti and the computer game yearbooks that were predecessors of the Pelit magazine . He has worked for the latter since its founding in 1992 , and holds a column in addition to making reviews and other reports . Nirvi began his career as a game reviewer in 1986 on pages of MikroBitti . He had made a bet with his friend that he could get his review published in the magazine . He sent two reviews , Zoids and Uridium and the former was published ( they already had one Uridium review ) . Nirvi wrote reviews and a regular column about new games for Mikrobitti and became the \`\` game editor '' of the magazine . He also wrote reviews for C = Lehti . When Pelit , that concentrated solely on gaming , was founded by the same publisher , Nirvi joined its ranks as an editor , and has written a regular column for each issue .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Branca was the attorney for? ? Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\".

Article: The most important factor in controlling your feelings for someone is reducing the amount of time you spend with them, especially time spent alone. Avoid the person as much as you can, if possible. If you can’t completely avoid them, make sure the two of you aren’t spending time together alone. For example, if this person asks you out for drinks, suggest that you make it a group activity to limit alone time. Instead, surround yourself with people like friends and family who are positive, uplifting, and make you feel great. They should be accepting and supportive of your feelings. Also, they should be contributing to your own visions, and understand that this is your own personal story to live. Keeping up with the person online can still influence your feelings, so get some distance there, too. Unfriend them on your social media profiles. If this seems too drastic, download an app that controls your social media usage altogether—if you can’t log onto Facebook, you can’t stalk their page. Commit to unplugging during the times when you’re most likely to cyber-stalk. You might also get help from smartphone apps like Freedom and SelfControl. You also want to limit their feelings for you, too, if possible. Therefore, it’s best to avoid leading them on. Seemingly harmless compliments, touches, or glances can send the message that you like someone. So, avoid such interactions. If you must interact with them, treat them with polite indifference, sticking to “hi” and “bye.” When you are falling in love with someone, your view of them is often skewed. You can only see what makes this person so great. To control your feelings, develop a more sober and realistic perception of the other person. No one is perfect. Make a list of why this person isn’t. Review the list whenever you start thinking of them too highly. For instance, if you're dealing with an old flame, you might list out why you broke up with them, including reasons like \\"He lies compulsively\\" or \\"She doesn't prioritize spending time with me.\\" Maybe your reason for wanting to avoid falling in love with this person lies in their relationship status. If this person has a significant other, envision that person’s face or name whenever you’re fantasizing about them. This may help you maintain objectivity. Being in love with someone and acting on those feelings are two very different feelings. Sometimes, no matter what you try, your heart can’t prevent itself from falling for someone. However, if you don’t want to be in a relationship or aren’t ready for love, don’t act on those feelings. Acknowledge that you like the person and really enjoy their company, but remind yourself that you’re not in the market for love right now. One way to do this is by examining key goals in your life that you would like to accomplish before falling in love again. For instance, maybe you'd like to finish your degree before entering a new relationship or maybe you want to travel the world. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, to control your feelings for someone, it's crucial to reduce the amount of time you spend with them, especially alone. Surround yourself with positive, uplifting people like friends and family. Limit online interactions by unfollowing them on social media or using apps to control your usage. Avoid leading them on and maintain a realistic perception of the person by listing their imperfections. If you still find yourself falling in love, acknowledge your feelings but remind yourself of your personal goals that you want to accomplish before entering a relationship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His partying brother, Tito (Eduard Fernández), who is sleeping with Uxbals estranged wife, is his partner in working with the sweatshop.

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.

Summarize: These are tough times for the 19-nation eurozone, as its recovery from the debt crisis remains anaemic, with persistently high unemployment and weak growth. What are the key issues that will dominate the leaders' talks in Brussels on Thursday and Friday? Avoiding Greek default and Grexit €320bn Greece's debt mountain €240bn European bailout 177% country's debt-to-GDP ratio 25% fall in GDP since 2010 26% Greek unemployment rate Greece is just days away from possible default and empty coffers. Eurozone finance ministers meet again on Wednesday, to decide whether the Greek government's new reform package meets the bailout conditions. That could determine whether the leaders arrive smiling or grim-faced. Agreement would provide only a temporary breathing space. Greece would not crash out of the euro, a bank run could be avoided, but Greece's debt mountain is 177% of GDP - nearly double the country's total annual economic output. A deal would unblock the €7.2bn (£5bn; 8bn) of bailout money that Greece desperately needs. But Greece will need tens of billions of euros more in future, to make its economy viable and pay off its colossal debts. The Greek crisis affects market confidence in the euro. But it is also a clash of visions about Europe. Richer countries such as Germany and the Netherlands demand budgetary rigour and refuse to end up subsidising indebted southern Europeans. The leftist Greek government and many ordinary Greeks reject austerity and the liberal free market agenda. The anti-austerity mood is also strong in Spain and other EU countries hit hard by the debt crisis. Is Greece close to Grexit? Why should I care about Greece? Deepening monetary union EU leaders believe that eurozone stability depends on further integration, co-ordinating economic targets. The debt crisis dramatically exposed how weaknesses in one country could undermine its eurozone partners. But getting there is politically fraught - populists across Europe have made gains in elections by rejecting the \\"ever closer union\\" idea. A blueprint for deeper eurozone integration has been written by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other top EU officials, including European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. It will be a focus of the talks, and among its proposals are: Treaty change is considered necessary to give a solid legal basis to economic integration. The document suggests, however, that treaty change would be postponed until after general elections in France and Germany in 2017. The UK and other EU states outside the euro - including Denmark and Poland - want the eurozone to prosper, but not if it means a two-tier system with eurozone countries setting the agenda and rules for the single market. Eurozone ministers agree bank deal UK renegotiation UK Prime Minister David Cameron will not want Greece to dominate the summit talks, because he wants to get support among the leaders for EU reforms meaningful enough to persuade a sceptical British public. This summit is his launch pad for renegotiation of the UK's EU membership terms, ahead of the UK in/out referendum promised by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron has had meetings with national leaders individually, on a European tour. He will need to get all 27 other member states to sign up to new arrangements for the UK. The EU principle of free movement of people is non-negotiable - EU leaders have made that clear to Mr Cameron. But there is scope for change in the rules on migrants' benefits - a key issue for the UK Conservatives. Mr Cameron is also expected to push for an opt-out from the EU's \\"ever closer union\\" ambition, and for guarantees that the rights of \\"euro outs\\" will not be watered down - especially in the single market - as eurozone integration advances. Q&A: UK's planned EU referendum Migrant influx EU solidarity is under severe strain because of the surge in migrants fleeing Libya aboard unseaworthy boats bound for Italy. Tensions rose when France blocked hundreds of African migrants at the Italian border. But any re-imposition of border controls would violate the spirit of the EU's Schengen agreement. Greece is also struggling with record numbers of migrants - and the boats will probably keep coming in the summer months. A Mediterranean naval operation has been launched to track people-smuggling networks. The EU wants to get a UN mandate to use force to stop the people-smugglers. The European Commission has drawn up plans to ease the burden faced by Italy and Greece, but the idea of mandatory quotas for moving migrants to other EU countries is not popular. The plan is to relocate 60,000 asylum seekers from Syria and Eritrea, who fled war and/or persecution. Economic migrants would not qualify. France and Germany say the Commission's \\"distribution key\\" for relocating them needs further work. And several East European countries reject mandatory quotas, saying migrants do not want to be told where to live. Who are the Med's migrants? Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? Tensions with Russia The EU decided this week to extend the sanctions against Russia until the end of January 2016. So that is unlikely to take up much time at the summit. Russia is still helping the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine with heavy weapons and troops, Western leaders say. Moscow denies that. But the sanctions are hurting the EU too, with Russia blocking imports of Western food. Italy and Greece are among the countries eager to get sanctions eased or lifted. But there has to be progress towards a peace settlement in Ukraine for that to happen. Continuing clashes in eastern Ukraine mean that the rebels and Ukrainian government forces are still far from the targets agreed in the Minsk ceasefire deal.","completion":"The eurozone is going through a tough time with high unemployment and weak growth. There are many issues that the leaders need to talk about, such as Greece possibly leaving the euro and needing help with money. There is also a situation with many people from other countries coming to the EU. They need to make plans for how to help these people, but not everyone agrees on the best way to do that."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: The Beginning Gerard O'Neal, a thirty-five-year-old successful architect, lives a comfortable life in a bustling city. He has two brothers, Declan, the eldest and Jack, the youngest, and two sisters, Siobhan and Laura, the twins. Although they grew up in a close-knit family, the siblings all went their separate ways after their parents, Patrick and Eileen, both passed away in a car accident ten years ago. Act 2: The Family Reunion One day, Gerard receives a letter from their late father's attorney, Mr. Fitzgerald. It turns out Patrick had hidden a secret safe deposit box, which can only be opened by all his children together, and the attorney in charge of it is retiring. Gerard tries to reunite the siblings for the first time in a decade. He manages to convince Declan, a workaholic business owner, Siobhan, an aspiring artist, and Laura, a doting mother of two, to come together. Jack, a recovering addict turned fitness instructor, is the most reluctant, but ultimately joins the group. Act 3: The Inheritance At Fitzgerald's office, the siblings open the safe deposit box, revealing a mysterious key and a cryptic letter from their father, claiming it leads to a hidden treasure that has been in the O'Neal family for generations. Feeling a sense of connection with their deceased parents, the siblings embark on an adventure to find the treasure, which, according to the letter, is located in their ancestral homeland of Ireland. Act 4: Old Wounds and Conflicts As the siblings explore Ireland together, they're forced to confront the unresolved conflicts and complex dynamics that have haunted their relationship for years. Each sibling is holding onto past resentments and baggage that might jeopardize their quest. Gerard, though always considered the peacemaker, finds himself struggling with whether or not he truly wants reconciliation among his siblings or just a quiet life without them. Act 5: The Treasure Finally, after solving all the puzzles and riddles left by their father, they discover the treasure: an old, decrepit house by the Irish coast. Here, Gerard and his siblings learn the truth about their family's history, which was riddled with hardships, tragedies, and triumphs. The house symbolizes their love, unity, and perseverance through the generations. Act 6: Reconciliation and Forgiveness Realizing the journey their father sent them on was more about the time spent reconnecting as a family than any material inheritance, the siblings resolve their conflicts and rebuild their relationships. They decide to use the house as their family's gathering place, turning it into a safe haven for the O'Neal family. Epilogue: A New Chapter Gerard and his siblings return to their individual lives, but their bond remains stronger than ever. They make it a tradition to meet at the house every year, keeping their family history and love alive. The adventure for the treasure gives them a new perspective on life, and their newfound unity allows them to each face the future as a stronger individual."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another, seemingly more pressing crisis.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. If you're obsessing over a challenge or problem, try to solve it. Brainstorm a list of options, so you feel like you have options. If you have trouble seeing potential solutions, talk with other people who have experienced a similar situation to the one you're trying to solve. Other people may be able to offer you a different perspective to solving your problem. For example, maybe you've been obsessing over a way to maintain your fitness through a life change. Your challenge could be finding a way to schedule your morning run while still being able to take your new infant to daycare. You might talk to another new parent or offer to take turns with childcare so you can work out. You may feel that obsessing over something or someone has isolated you from friends and family. Re-connect to friends, family, or co-workers who you can explain your situation to. Talking can help you understand the underlying cause of your obsession and having a support network to turn to can reduce your stress. For example, if you're obsessing over an ex after a break up, talk with a friend or family member. Talking with your friend might help you realize that you're obsessed because your ex was the first person to take you seriously in a relationship. It's easy to slip into the routine of obsessing over something if you're not challenging yourself with new things. If you've been meaning to pursue a new hobby or take a class, start doing it. Not only will you take your mind off of your obsession by focusing on a new task or skill, you may also meet new people or learn something new about yourself. New people and new ways of thinking can help you move beyond your obsession. You might realize that you no longer crave whatever the obsession rewarded you with. For example, you might not obsess over a lost job opportunity if you learn a new trade that you actually enjoy more. You might be so focused on obsessing over something going on in your life, that you completely overlook the lives of your friends, family members, or people in your community. Reach out to people who might need your help. Not only will they appreciate it, but you'll realize there's more to life than your obsession. For example, you might tutor at a school, serve at a soup kitchen, or drive an elderly relative to the grocery store.

Use extra flour on the surface and your hands 2. Oil the surface slightly before kneading 3. Keep the surface and dough cold by using ice packs 4. Use a silicone mat for kneading 5. Wet your hands while kneading Evaluating each method: 1. Using extra flour is a common and effective method to prevent dough from sticking. It may change the dough's consistency, but you can adjust the recipe accordingly. 2. Oiling the surface is another option, especially for higher hydration doughs. It doesn't affect dough consistency as much, but it can be messy. 3. Keeping the surface and dough cold is not practical, as it requires a lot of ice packs and may negatively impact the dough development. 4. Using a silicone mat provides a non-stick surface, which can be helpful in preventing dough from sticking. It's a good reusable solution and doesn't alter the dough consistency. 5. Wetting your hands can be helpful for very sticky dough, but not all dough types. Given these options, using a silicone mat (method 4) is the most reasonable choice for accomplishing your goal.

Takeru Kobayashi was arrested at Coney Island after his rival, Joey Chestnut, won the annual Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest. The six-time champion of the contest was trying to make his way on stage after this year's event, according to a representative for Kobayashi and a New York police officer at the Brooklyn precinct booking desk. The incident was not a publicity stunt, Maggie James, Kobayashi's spokeswoman, said Sunday night. \\"He got excited when people chanted his name after the contest .... so he jumped up on the stage because he wanted his fans to see him and (he thought) maybe they would chant, 'Let him eat,'\\" James said, referring to a dispute that kept Kobayashi from the table this year. Currently ranked third,","completion":"Kobayashi's absence from the competition was due to his ongoing dispute with Major League Eating (MLE), the organization that sanctions the contest. The disagreement stemmed from MLE's insistence that Kobayashi sign an exclusive contract, which he saw as restrictive and limiting his opportunities outside the competition circuit. Despite his arrest, Kobayashi's popularity did not wane. His fans were outraged by the event organizers' decision to exclude him from the contest and were vocal in their support. Social media was ablaze with #FreeKobi hashtags, and many called for the MLE's negotiation terms to be revised. Following his release, Kobayashi chose to pursue new avenues to showcase his talent. He participated in various eating contests outside the MLE's domain and established a significant presence on YouTube and other social media platforms, racking up millions of views as he tackled incredible food challenges. Realizing the valuable publicity and fanbase that Kobayashi brought to their competitions, the MLE eventually decided to extend an olive branch. After some long negotiations, they reached a compromise, allowing Kobayashi to compete in their contests while retaining his freedom to explore other opportunities. Both parties were satisfied with the outcome, and Kobayashi returned to the Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest the following year. The rivalry between him and Joey Chestnut continued to intensify, as did the excitement of their fans. Both athletes pushed themselves to the edge of their abilities, making the contest even more thrilling and closely watched. In the climactic final face-off between the two legends, Kobayashi managed to regain his title in an awe-inspiring display of speed, skill, and determination. As he stood on stage, the crowd chanting his name in unison, Kobayashi took a moment to thank his fans, acknowledging their undying support and the role they played in bringing him back to the contest that had first made him famous. The story ends on a high note, with Kobayashi's triumphant return cementing his legacy as one of the greatest competitive eaters of all time. More than just a series of contests, this story also highlights the importance of standing up for oneself, the value of perseverance, and the power that comes from the unwavering support of fans. From his conflicts with MLE to his ultimate victory, Kobayashi's story serves as an inspiring example of a true champion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Stephen Arthur Stills (born January 3, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Beginning his professional career with Buffalo Springfield, he composed one of their few hits \\"For What It's Worth,\\" which became one of the most recognizable songs of the 1960s. Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You Stills was involved with the musician Judy Collins from 1968 to 1969 and wrote the song \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" for her. He dated actress and singer-songwriter Nancy Priddy who was the inspiration for his Buffalo Springfield song \\"Pretty Girl Why\\". He also had a short-term relationship with Rita Coolidge, as had Graham Nash, which apparently led to the initial breakup of CSN, in 1970. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married his first wife, the singer-songwriter Veronique Sanson. Their son Christopher was born in 1974. They divorced in 1979. In 1976, Stills told Rolling Stone, \\"My hearing has gotten to be a terrible problem. If I keep playing and touring the way I have been, I'll go deaf.\\" In 1988, he married the Thai model Pamela Anne Jordan, with whom he had a daughter, Eleanor. His third wife is Kristen Hathaway (Kristen Stills), whom he married in 1996. Stills's son, Justin Stills, was born in 1972 to Harriet Tunis. Justin was critically injured while snowboarding on Mt. Charleston, just outside Las Vegas, in 1997. An episode of Discovery Health's documentary series Trauma: Life in the ER featured his treatment and recovery. Another son, Henry, has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and is profiled in the 2007 documentary Autism: The Musical. Stills's daughter Eleanor is a photographer and graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Since Eleanor's graduation, she has been responsible for all recent Crosby, Stills & Nash photography. Stills has another daughter, Alex, who attends Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. His son Chris and daughter Jennifer are both recording artists. His youngest son, Oliver Ragland, was born in 2004 and named in honor of Neil Young, whose maternal family name is Ragland. Like all four members of CSNY, Stills has long been involved in liberal causes and politics. In 2000, he served as a member of the Democratic credentials committee from Florida during the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate in previous years. The comic book series Scott Pilgrim features a character by the name of Stephen Stills, referred to as \\"the Talent\\" by the band he shares with the title character. The character also plays an acoustic guitar and sings, and is often portrayed wearing the kind of western shirts that is part of Stills's standard wardrobe.

El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting., can you guess it ?

My preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. How wrong I was. Big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. I qualify with the word visually, because \\"War Of The Worlds\\" is a lot darker and scarier than \\"Forbidden Planet\\", and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory. What impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in Dr. Morbius' (Walter Pidgeon) home and laboratory. But that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the Krell stronghold. It appeared that Krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of \\"Star Wars\\". Which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with SW, or in 1986 with \\"Aliens\\". Watching it on a large screen TV in my living room offered me the same effect, and I'm fairly resistant to hyperbole. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine \\"Forbidden Planet\\" as a direct antecedent of the 'Star Trek' TV series; Gene Roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. Followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'Star Trek'. I had to do a double take when the men of United Planets Cruiser C57-V headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to Robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the ST series. Where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the Id'. That Morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend Altaire IV was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with Martians or other grotesque space creatures. The film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that Morbius was the protector of Altaire IV some time before Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) explained it. You know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn't that far off. This movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. I think though, that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of Robby. What is the sentiment of this review?

This phrase translates the English context into Russian. The translation is done in a way that makes the meaning clear and understandable for a Russian speaker, keeping all the original details from the English version. The structure of Russian sentences can slightly differ from English, however in this case the translation follows the English sentence structure quite closely. The verb forms (like \\"enjoyed\\", \\"called\\", \\"asked\\") have been translated into the past tense (like \\"понравилось\\", \\"звонили\\", \\"спрашивали\\"). Also the pronouns (\\"us\\", \\"we\\") has been kept in the sentence as \\"нам\\" and \\"мы\\". The words \\"future events\\" have been translated as \\"будущих событиях\\", and \\"going to organize\\" has been translated as \\"собираемся организовать\\". These phrases translated to Russian keep the original intention and context, ensuring the listener or reader understands the information in the same way a person speaking English would. Additionally, the Russian language usually doesn't use articles, so words like \\"it\\" and \\"the\\" were not directly translated in this case. The overall structure of Russian sentences adheres more to the general meaning than to the literal word-for-word translation. In general, maintaining the structure close to the original English sentence and adequate translation of verb forms and pronouns ensures the fidelity of translation. Also, adherence to the specific features of Russian syntax in terms of the absence of articles contributes to the fluency and accuracy of the translation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: To close the metal rings in chainmail. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Options: -- Use pliers to force them closed. -- Use tweezers to force them closed.","completion":"To accomplish the goal of closing the metal rings in chainmail, it would be more sensible to use pliers rather than tweezers to force them closed. Both pliers and tweezers have their specific uses and advantages; however, pliers are better suited for the task of working with metal rings due to several reasons: 1. Strength and durability: Pliers are typically made of more robust materials, such as steel, which allows for greater strength and durability during use. In comparison, tweezers are often made of lighter materials, like stainless steel, aluminum, or even plastic. This may cause them to bend or break when attempting to close metal rings, especially if those rings are made of a tough or thick metal. 2. Appropriate grip: Pliers provide a better grip on the metal rings, which is necessary to provide adequate force to close the rings without slipping. Tweezers generally have a smaller and more delicate grip surface, which might not hold the metal rings as securely. This could lead to difficulty in applying the required pressure to close the rings properly. 3. Leverage: Pliers have longer handles than tweezers, which allows the user to apply more force with less effort. The longer handles provide better leverage, making it much easier to close the metal rings. On the other hand, tweezers have short handles, which may lead to the user requiring more effort and potentially causing hand strain when trying to close the rings. 4. Variability: Pliers come in various sizes and styles, including needle-nose pliers and flat-nose pliers, which can be useful for different types of chainmail projects. Depending on the size and shape of the metal rings, one can choose the most appropriate set of pliers. Tweezers tend to be limited in size and design variations, which may not be suitable for all chainmail projects. 5. Multipurpose use: Pliers can be used for various tasks in chainmail creation, such as opening and closing the rings and even cutting or adjusting their size. Tweezers, on the other hand, are more specialized for smaller tasks, such as handling tiny components or beads and might not be as versatile in chainmail work. In conclusion, using pliers to close the metal rings in chainmail is a more practical and efficient approach. Pliers provide the necessary strength, durability, grip, leverage, and versatility to work effectively with metal rings, whereas tweezers would likely be insufficient for this task due to their limitations in grip strength, leverage, and general applicability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The Last Exorcism Part II was popular especially in Asia","completion":"In order to draw the conclusion that \\"The Last Exorcism Part II was popular especially in Asia,\\" we will need to gather more information: Step 1: Collect data on the film's performance in Asia This would involve looking at box office numbers, viewership ratings, or critic reviews from countries in Asia. We could also consider social media trends or any awards the film received in Asia. Step 2: Compare the data with other regions Once we have the data on the film's performance in Asia, compare it with the film's performance in other regions, such as North America, Europe, and Oceania.

Article: World leaders from nearly 200 countries have signed an important historic agreement to fight global climate change. The agreement came after two weeks of talks between the leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France. As part of the Paris agreement, countries said they would cut down on pollution However, according to the terms of the deal, countries that don't do this will not be punished, or fined. Instead,the document is meant to show that governments around the world take climate change seriously and are willing to work together to fight global warming. World leaders have met many times to discuss climate change. But, the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, which began on November 30 in Paris, was the first time they agreed on a global, legal pact . Before the conference, each nation was asked to create plans on how to reach the shared goal. The pact that was signed allows countries to decide the best way to cut down their gas pollution. No matter how they decide to go green, each country must report honestly on all of their efforts. Every five years, nations must look at the work they've done and submit new plans on how they will improve over the next five years. In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees,soil and oceans can absorb naturally. It urges countries to spend trillions of dollars on creating new energy sources, like solar and wind power. It also requires countries to raise at least 100 billion each year to help developing countries. However, critics of the pact say it is not detailed enough, and doesn't include specifics about how the plan will be enforced and how improvements will be measured. The pact does include one large, specific goal: how countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 60degF(20degC) by 2100. Nonetheless,the agreement is considered by many world leaders to be a major victory. The U. N. has been working more than two decades to convince governments to work...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. We need to wake up and be more aware Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"We need to wake up and be more aware. It is crucial for individuals to understand the importance of being conscious of their surroundings, engaging with both global and local issues, and making well-informed decisions. Awareness includes various aspects: personal development, environmental consciousness, social dynamics, and understanding our responsibilities as members of society. Personal development starts with self-awareness. It involves acknowledging our strengths and weaknesses, setting realistic goals, and working to achieve them. Improving our knowledge, skills, and abilities enables us to make rational decisions and enhance our lives. By cultivating good habits and nurturing a growth mindset, we become more resilient, adaptive, and empathetic. Furthermore, environmental consciousness plays a vital role in our collective well-being. We must recognize the impact human activities have on the planet and strive to minimize our ecological footprint. Conserving energy and water, reducing waste, embracing recycling, and supporting renewable energy sources are practical steps we can take to protect the environment. It is our shared responsibility to preserve Earth's natural resources, biodiversity, and ecosystems for current and future generations. Next, understanding social dynamics in today's interconnected world is essential for maintaining harmony and fostering collaboration between diverse communities. We need to educate ourselves about social issues, empathize with those who face marginalization or discrimination, and engage in informed discussions. By celebrating cultural differences and valuing unique perspectives, we can work towards more inclusive and equitable societies. Finally, as members of society, we have responsibilities towards each other and the world at large. We must uphold the values of fairness, respect, and empathy, and be accountable for our actions. Civic engagement, participating in volunteer initiatives, and supporting charitable causes are some ways to contribute positively to society. By being active, informed citizens, we can help shape public policies and advocate for positive change. In conclusion, waking up and being more aware is a multidimensional endeavor that encompasses personal growth, environmental care, social understanding, and civic responsibility. By embracing these principles, we can collectively work towards sustainable growth, social progress, and a better world for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect, I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time. I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies, and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too. I also have a soft spot for people who are trying, sometimes against all odds, to live a dream. And again, these people are doing it. Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film? No. Not even close. But for what they do on their meager budgets, these films should be recommended. For me, the bottom line is always, was I entertained? Did I have a good time with this movie? And here the answer to both was \\"Yes.\\" The first in the series is also the most raw. It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something. Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site. Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility. They get rescued, but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole. Soon, the whole town is overtaken by the undead. And these zombies are fun. They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever, but they are fun. The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead, with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever! Pretty cheesy, but I think it was meant to be. Still, it moves very fast, has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style. The acting is uneven, but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track. I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie. Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this, his first film, but also has no delusions. He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to people involved. Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV. Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren't fun! Overall, this is a solid, if a bit flawed, release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter. While not breaking any grand rules of move making, I found the series to be fun and always a laugh, so I give this set a solid recommendation. Todd Sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks, he was trying, sometimes against all odds it seems, to make fun zero budget, splattery horror and to that end, he has succeeded in spades.

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws.

The reviewer seems to express dissatisfaction with Leticia's recent performance in several key aspects, including the quality of the food, the service, and the overall experience. The hint of nostalgia comes from the use of the phrase \\"Leticia's USE to be a great place for Mexican food,\\" which implies that the reviewer had previously enjoyed dining at the restaurant and had positive experiences in the past. This sentiment is further emphasized by the statement \\"unfortunately no longer,\\" suggesting that the reviewer feels a sense of loss due to the changes they have observed in the establishment. The negative sentiment in the review is primarily directed towards the service, food quality, and the direction the restaurant is taking. The reviewer mentions that the service is \\"very slow and sporadic at best.\\" This statement indicates a high level of dissatisfaction with the service, as they seem to imply that even at its best, it is still slow and inconsistent. Regarding the food quality, the review states that the food is \\"just ok\\" and that \\"the quality has definitely gone downhill.\\" These statements highlight a concern for the decline in the quality of the food being served and a decrease in the reviewer's enjoyment of the dishes. They suggest that the food no longer lives up to the expectations they had based on previous dining experiences at Leticia's. Finally, the reviewer expresses disappointment in the overall direction the restaurant is going. They mention that they \\"enjoy eating at local places, non-chains\\" and are \\"very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is going.\\" This indicates that the reviewer's dissatisfaction goes beyond just the service and the quality of the food; it also pertains to the perceived shift in the restaurant's values and focus. The fact that they specifically mention enjoying local, non-chain restaurants suggests that they feel Leticia's may be losing some of its authentic, locally-focused charm. In summary, the sentiment of this review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing dissatisfaction in several areas such as service, food quality, and the overall direction the restaurant is taking. There is also a sense of nostalgia and disappointment as the reviewer reflects on their past positive experiences at Leticia's and laments the current state of the establishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Going back to school is a very exciting event for my two boys. It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school. I just hope this school year will be a peaceful one.

We did this package that included VIP seating, unlimited hookah, a picture for the celebrant and admission for 10 people for 250. I had already spoken with someone over the phone and they said it would be ok for us to get the package. And when we got there, they acted like \\"what package?!\\" We ended up talking to the manager and when we showed the money, they remembered that they did have this package. We walked thru the metal detectors and were seated on three couches up front near the stage. It was almost 1am and there were a handful of people. I guess it was couples night and there were a handful of couples tryna get they're \\"freak on\\" I guess. When they came to ask what flavor hookah we wanted, they said they only had two flavors left. So we got those two flavors, mint & fruit punch. And when picture time came, the stupid waitress didn't even know how to work the camera. And all they did was print the picture and tape it to a card. So to the good part?! There was NO good part. Little Darlings is FULLY NUDE, but the bodies are bangin'. Small boobies, some cute girls and the dancers ARE LAZY AS F#%K!! Only a couple got on the pole to do some tricks. Most of them were just walking around stage and rolling around on the floor. It didn't take them long to take their strings of clothes off.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Robert lives in a small town. Five years ago, when he was nineteen, he finished middle school. He didn't like any subjects except playing when he was at school. Of course he learned nothing and the bosses wouldn't use a man like him. He has to stay at home, but doesn't do any housework, only watches TV or lies on bed. It makes his parents angry. They want him to study something, he always think it difficult and doesn't listen to them. One day Robert was walking near a bookshop while some young men were talking about the writers. He heard the publishing house pays the writers a lot. He became interested in it. As soon as he got home, he began to write. But he couldn't write anything. At last he bought a book and copied a story. Then he posted it to the publishing house. He waited for nearly half a year, but didn't get any answers. He had to ask an editor on the telephone, \\"Have you read my story yet, sir?\\" \\"Yes,\\" said the editor, \\"I had read it before you were born! \\" Question: His parents are angry with Robert because _ . Options: A: he wouldn't find any work B: he didn't study hard before C: he's too lazy to do any housework D: he isn't polite to them Answer:","completion":"The article conveys that Robert's parents are angry because of several reasons. To pinpoint the correct answer to the question \\"His parents are angry with Robert because _ .\\", let's dissect the details of the article. Option A: \\"he wouldn't find any work\\" - The article states that Robert does not find a job because \\"he learned nothing and the bosses wouldn't use a man like him\\". While his unemployment might be frustrating for his parents, the text does not directly say they are angry because of this reason. Option B: \\"he didn't study hard before\\" - The article shows that Robert wasn't fond of academic studies. He only liked playing while he was in school and \\"of course he learned nothing\\". Even though his parents wanted him to study, it does not explicitly express that they're angry due to his lack of studying in the past. Option C: \\"he's too lazy to do any housework\\" - This is the closest potential answer according to the context in the text. The article states that Robert has to stay at home, however, he \\"doesn't do any housework, only watches TV or lies on bed\\" which makes his parents angry. This statement directly connects his laziness in doing housework and his parents' anger. Option D: \\"he isn't polite to them\\" - The text does not mention any instance where Robert is impolite to his parents. In conclusion, while all of the options might indirectly describe reasons that could possibly upset Robert's parents, Option C: \\"he's too lazy to do any housework\\" is the only detail in the article that explicitly states why Robert's parents are angry. Therefore, it would be the most accurate answer according to the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about.

Question: Information: - The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China, and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC). The war began in August 1927, with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major hostilities ceased in 1950. It can generally be divided into two stages; the first being from 1927 to 1937, and the second being from 1946 to 1950 with the Second Sino-Japanese War separating them. The war was a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the CPC gaining control of almost the entirety of Mainland China, establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) to replace the KMT's Republic of China (ROC). It also caused a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all of China. - University College London (UCL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It is the largest postgraduate institution in the UK by enrollment and is regarded as one of the world's leading multidisciplinary research universities. Established in 1826 as London University by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion. UCL also makes the contested claims of being the third-oldest university in England and the first to admit women. In 1836 UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, which was granted a royal charter in the same year. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014). UCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and a satellite campus in Doha, Qatar. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several culturally significant museums and manages collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2015/16, UCL had around 38,300 students and 12,000 staff (including around 7,100 academic staff and 840 professors) and had a total income of £1.36 billion, of which £530 million was from research grants and contracts.

This week, we tell about the planet's surprising motion among the stars. For thousands of years, people have recognized that planets travel among the stars. The planets generally follow the path taken by the Sun through the sky. The Sun's path is called the ecliptic. The groups of stars along the ecliptic are called the Zodiac. The motion of the planets can be confusing at times. Everyone knows the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But this is caused by the turning motion of the Earth. Planets generally move from west to east. However, Mars will appear to move backward for about two months this year. This happens because the Earth is overtaking Mars on its way around the Sun. Mars began its backward, or westward, motion on May 11th, It will start moving eastward again on July 19th. Mars' apparent motion has been a mystery to astronomers for hundreds of years. Most early theories of the solar system argued that the Sun and planets turned around the Earth. But the sudden westward motion of Mars presented a problem. Why would Mars move west for two months when it nears \\"opposition\\"? In 1543, a Polish church worker named Nicolas Copernicus published a different theory. His theory said the Earth and planets moved around the Sun in perfectly circular orbits. Copernicus' theory was simpler. But his Sun - centered system still did not explain the observed motion of Mars very well. Finally, a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler published a complete theory of the motion of the planets in 1619. He had carefully studied the motion of Mars for many years. Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets do not move in circular orbits around the sun. Instead, they travel in flattened orbits called ellipses. Mars' elliptical orbit is the cause of its unusual brightening this year and its apparent large size. During the next several weeks, you can see for yourself why the mysterious motion of Mars has...

An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online. Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. \\"We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China.\\" the boy's mother told the local newspaper. With China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists.

Money was tight that year and Toby's parents had told him they would not be able to afford a holiday. Instead of dreaming about foreign travel, he had been reading a book, Letter to New Zealand, where the author explains what happens in an envelope's journey from England to the other side of the world. As they neared their house, Toby asked his mum, Sabine, if he could write a letter to New Zealand. After a few more steps he was struck by an even better idea. \\"Can I write a letter to every country in the world?\\" Sabine says she often wonders what would have happened if she had replied differently that day. \\"It was just one of those typical questions that five-year-olds have,\\" she says. \\" If he had asked me in the evening when I was tired, I might have refused. But as parents you realize there's a lot of power in just allowing kids to have a go. Also, it seemed a nice way to do some armchair exploration. So I told him\\" Let's see how far you get.\\" The answer was very far indeed. Toby has since written and posted letters to all 193 UN mumber states, as well as numerous other bad-conditioned areas with comforting ones. To date he has written 681 letters- the best of which have been selected to appear in a new book called Dear World, How Are You?- although so productive is Toby' pen that the number will have risen by the time you read this. \\"Writing these letters has made me realize that the world isn't actually all that big,\\" he says with a grin. In the future, part of him would like to be a musical director to turn his beloved Star Wars into a ballet.

A:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. Several negative experiences and observations are mentioned by the reviewer, which collectively contribute to the unfavorable impression of the product. Firstly, the reviewer highlights the issue of the initial product receiving in a damaged condition, which is likely to raise doubts regarding the packaging, shipping or manufacturing quality. This aspect creates the impression that the product might not be as durable or robust as it is supposed to be for outdoor activities like camping. Secondly, the reviewer mentions their bad experience of dropping the product while using it, which resulted in shattering it into numerous pieces. This situation brings attention to a potential lack of resilience and sturdiness needed under real-life usage conditions, especially for adventurous or physically demanding activities. Furthermore, the reviewer questions the product's suitability for camping, pointing to inexplicable durability issues despite being designed for such purposes. This statement undermines the product's effectiveness and validity in fulfilling its intended purpose and is a strong indicator of customer dissatisfaction. Lastly, the reviewer provides a specific recommendation to stick with stainless steel mirrors for non-stationary uses, which implies that the reviewed product is inferior compared to traditional alternatives. This comparison further discredits the product's value and desirability. In conclusion, this review portrays the product negatively and diminishes its reputation by emphasizing various shortcomings and failures experienced by the reviewer.

Horses can inflict serious injury with their legs, so understanding how your horse uses his legs to communicate will be very important for your personal safety. Your horse will paw or stamp the ground with his front legs when he is feeling impatient, frustrated, or uncomfortable. Splayed (spread out) front legs indicates that your horse is getting ready to run or bolt. It could also mean that your horse has medical issues that prevents him from standing properly; your veterinarian will be needed to diagnose the underlying cause. Lifting either one front leg or back leg signals a threat. If you see your horse doing this, step back to a safe distance; a horse kick can cause serious injury. Your horse may cock his back leg by resting the front edge of his hoof on the ground and lowering his hip. This indicates that he is relaxed. Your horse will sometimes engage in Bucking behavior, which is when he raises his back legs in the air. This is often playful behavior (sometimes accompanied by grunting and squealing), but can also indicate uncertainty and fear, especially if he's being ridden for the first time. Rearing up is another dual-sided behavior. It can signal playfulness in foals in the field but, if it is an angry stallion in fight mode, it can be a sign of fear when the horse cannot escape the situation. You can understand how your horse is feeling by looking at him as a whole to see how he moves and stands. For example, if your horse’s back is raised, he could be sore from having the saddle on him for a long time. Rigid muscles and stiff movements can mean that your horse is nervous, stressed, or in pain. If you are not sure why your horse looks rigid or stiff, your veterinarian can conduct various behavioral and medical tests (dental exam, lameness exam) to determine the cause. Trembling is a sign of fear. Your horse may tremble to the point of wanting to run or fight. If he does this, give him plenty of space and time to calm down. He may also need to be desensitized to his fear; an experienced veterinary behaviorist can help your horse overcome his fear. Your horse may swing his hindquarters to indicate that he’s getting ready to kick; move away quickly if he starts doing this. If your horse is female, she may swing her hindquarters to indicate that she is in heat and trying to get the attention of a male horse. Horses have a range of noises that they will make to communicate different things. Understanding what these different noises mean will help you better understand what your horse is trying to communicate with you and other horses. Your horse will neigh for several reasons. He may neigh to indicate anxiety or distress; this will be a very high-pitched sound and could be accompanied by a lowered tail and flickering ears. He may also neigh to acknowledge his presence. A confident neigh will sound like a bugle and will be accompanied by a slightly lifted tail, forward-pricked ears. A nicker is a soft, throaty sound. To make this sound, your horse will keep his mouth closed while producing the sound from his vocal chords. A mare will sometime use this sound with her foal. Your horse may also make this sound when he knows that it’s almost feeding time. This is usually a friendly sound. Squeals can be a display of threat. Two horses who are meeting each other for the first time may squeal at each other. Squeals can also be a sign of playfulness, such as when your horse is bucking. Your horse will snort by inhaling quickly and then exhaling through his nose. With this sound, he could be signaling that he is alarmed when another animal has come too close to him. He could also be indicating that he's excited about something. Be aware that the act of snorting can get horses worked up; you may need to calm him down if this happens. Just like people, your horse will sigh to express relief and relaxation. The sighs are different for each each emotion: relief–deep inhale, then a slow exhale through the nose or mouth; relaxation–lowered head with an exhalation that makes a fluttering noise. Groans can indicate different things. For example, your horse may groan if he's in pain during riding (eg, landing hard after a jumping a fence, his rider thuds heavily in the saddle). He might also groan when he's happily exercising without pain. Groaning could also indicate more serious medical issues, such as constipation or gastric pain due to ulcers. If you have trouble determine why your horse is groaning, consult a horse expert. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses how horses use their legs and various noises to communicate their feelings, emotions, and intentions. It highlights the importance of understanding these signals for the safety of both the horse and its handler. The article describes different leg gestures, such as pawing, splayed legs, lifting legs, cocking back legs, bucking, and rearing, and their respective meanings. It also covers various horse sounds like neighing, nickering, squealing, snorting, sighing, and groaning, each conveying different messages. Recognizing and interpreting these signals can help in managing the horse's behavior, addressing potential health issues, and building a stronger bond between the horse and its handler."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Justin will not drive again.","completion":"Based on the context provided, we cannot confidently draw the hypothesis that \\"Justin will not drive again.\\" The information given in the context does not provide any indication or strong evidence suggesting that Justin will never drive again. We can, however, generate a few different hypotheses regarding what might happen next or possible consequences of the event, but it is essential to note that these hypotheses are not definitive conclusions. These hypotheses should be based on a reasonable connection to the provided context. Hypothesis 1: Justin's car will require significant repairs or replacement. Reasoning: In the context, it is mentioned that Justin's car made a loud noise, and after pulling over and examining the vehicle, he discovered that his engine was blown. This indicates that there will be a need for repairs or replacement. Hypothesis 2: Justin may experience some inconvenience due to the incident. Reasoning: Since Justin's car has broken down during his trip, he had to call for help and wait to be picked up. This suggests that he might face some inconvenience and delay in his plans due to the breakdown. Hypothesis 3: Justin might seek assistance from friends, family, or professional services for his car repair. Reasoning: As stated in the context, Justin called for help after his car broke down. This implies that he would likely be looking for support from either friends, family, or professional services to help him with his car repair and get back on the road.

The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What could happen to the top few teams at the end of the season?","completion":"At the end of a domestic season, a number of outcomes could happen to the top few teams in each league, depending on the specific structure and rules of their respective league systems. Here are the most common scenarios: 1. Championship and Title: The team finishing at the top of the league table is crowned the champion of the division and often receives a trophy. This is seen as a major achievement in club football, and it is a great source of pride for the players, coaching staff, and fans. 2. Promotion: In many countries with multi-tier league systems, the top few teams (usually two or three) earn promotion to a higher division for the following season. This allows clubs to progress upwards through the football hierarchy and potentially reach the highest level in their country's league system. Promotion can provide significant financial rewards and an opportunity to compete against stronger teams. Sometimes, playoffs involving the top few teams are conducted to determine promotions. 3. Qualification for Continental Competitions: Top teams in many leagues also qualify for international club competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League (in Europe), the Copa Libertadores (in South America), the CAF Champions League (in Africa), the AFC Champions League (in Asia), and the Concacaf Champions League (in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean). Participating in these tournaments offers clubs the opportunity to compete at a higher level, increase their fan base, and earn extra revenue. 4. Financial Rewards: Finishing positions in the league table often correlate with significant financial rewards. Sponsorships, television rights, and other revenue streams usually increase for teams in higher positions, helping to strengthen the club's financial position in the long run. 5. Prestige and Attraction of New Talent: Teams that finish near the top of the league are more likely to attract new players, retain their current talent, and garner respect in the football world. A strong league finish can help teams build a more competitive squad, enhance their reputation, and create a solid foundation for sustainable success. 6. Enhanced Fan Support and Engagement: A successful season can lead to increased fan engagement, better home game attendance, and growing product sales. This positive feedback loop helps clubs generate more funds and strengthens their connection with supporters. In summary, the top few teams at the end of a season can expect increased prestige, financial rewards, promotion to higher divisions, and qualification for continental competitions, depending on the specific rules and structure of their respective league systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Lennon become involved with in a protest? from the following article ? In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response...

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Being close to someone requires telling them exactly what you want. Even if you think you're being obvious, many people have a hard time picking up on hints and indirect communication. You have to be willing to say what's on your mind, even if it's something that you're afraid your partner won't like. For example, you might say \\"I would like to be closer with you and share more of my life with you.\\" If you feel like there's a barrier between you, or your partner is putting up a wall, you might say \\"I feel as though you're closed off to me, and I would like for us to get closer. Would you like to talk about it?\\" When you attempt to communicate through hints or indirect communication, you always have an out. If your partner picks up on your hint and doesn't like it, you can claim you didn't mean that at all. But even if you avoided a potential conflict, there will still be distance between you. Lies and deceit are always a barrier to closeness. However, refusing to share pieces of your life with your partner or keeping secrets from them can be just as damaging. When they find out about something you've been keeping from them, they may wonder what else you've been hiding. For example, suppose you have a dance class twice a week, but for some reason, you don't want to tell your significant other. Maybe you think they will ridicule you. So you keep it a secret. However, by doing that you are building a wall between the two of you. This doesn't mean that you can't keep a birthday present or surprise party a secret. However, in that situation, you should also be aware that your partner will likely sense that you're keeping something from them, and might start to get suspicious. When your partner is talking to you, stop doing other things and pay attention to them. Use statements such as \\"I hear you saying that...\\" then put what they said in your own words. If your understanding or perception isn't accurate, they can correct it. Then the two of you are both on the same page. This doesn't mean you can't ever do other things while talking to your partner. For example, they may want to chat while you're doing the dishes or making the bed. But if they want to talk about something relatively serious, stop what you're doing and listen. Nod and look them in the eye (if this is culturally appropriate) to communicate that you are paying attention to them. Sharing your own inner thoughts and feelings may make you feel more vulnerable, but your partner will appreciate that you trusted them enough to share something so private and personal. Opening up in this way is a good way to get closer to your partner, as well as learning about each other. For example, you might reveal that you always cry at the beginning of the movie \\"Up.\\" If your partner responds by saying \\"Oh, I understand. That's one of the most emotional scenes ever, and yet it's a cartoon without dialogue,\\" then you've found a deeper emotional connection. You might also tell your partner about past experiences that helped shape who you are or what you believe. Be careful revealing too much about yourself if your partner is not reciprocating with equally intimate information about themselves. If you revealed you cry at a certain movie, for example, they might confess a movie that always makes them cry or admit that they've never cried at a movie. When you criticize your partner, you may give them the impression that you think they're not good enough for you. They may put up defensive barriers, impeding your efforts to get closer to them. Try to flip criticisms around so that you focus on what you're missing rather than what your partner is or isn't doing. For example, you might say \\"We have so much fun when we go out together\\" rather than \\"you never want to do anything.\\" Try to use plural pronouns, such as \\"we\\" and \\"us,\\" as much as possible. Singular pronouns, such as \\"I\\" and \\"you,\\" verbally pit the two of you against each other. Plural pronouns emphasize that you're a team and you're in it together. When the two of you disagree about something, try to find a way to resolve the problem rather than tearing your partner down. Your goal should not be to win the argument but to move your relationship to a better place. Seek your partner's side of the story and empathize with them. Keep in mind that if you insult your partner, or lose your cool and start cursing at them, you'll likely regret it later. You could also deeply hurt them. Flying off the handle like this can also cross the line into verbal, psychological, or even physical abuse. If you're too upset to talk constructively, tell your partner that you need a few minutes of quiet time to calm down before you'll be able to talk about it. Then separate yourself from them for a few minutes. You could move to another room or go for a walk. When you first met your significant other, you likely had a million questions for them and wanted to know everything about them. But once you've been together for a while, that curiosity can fade. You may think you already know everything about them – but you don't. Ask them how they think and feel about things rather than assuming you know. This applies to both large and small things in your life. For example, if the two of you are watching a TV show together, you might ask them which character is their favorite and why, or what the best part of the show is for them. Ask open-ended questions and give your partner the chance to surprise you. For example, a question such as \\"You like pizza, right?\\" is a yes/no question that doesn't give you the opportunity to learn anything new about your partner. However, if you asked \\"What's your favorite quick dinner?\\" their answer might surprise you. Your significant other will feel more comfortable opening up to you and letting you get closer if you show a real interest in the things that are going on in their life. If you've made an effort to listen actively, put that knowledge to use by asking them specific questions about things they mentioned. For example, you might ask \\"How's your research going for your history paper?\\" or \\"Did your boss like your presentation this morning?\\" Asking generally about work or school doesn't show interest the same way. Use as many specific details as possible to indicate that you were paying attention to them and you really care about what's going on in their life.","completion":"To foster closeness in relationships, communicate directly, share personal thoughts and feelings, listen actively, avoid criticism, and show genuine interest in your partner's life."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin., In Greek mythology , Erato / rto / ( Ancient Greek : ) is one of the Greek Muses . The name would mean \`\` desired '' or \`\` lovely '' , if derived from the same root as Eros , as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his Argonautica . Erato is the Muse of lyric poetry . In the Orphic hymn to the Muses , it is Erato who charms the sight . Since the Renaissance she is often shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses , holding a lyre , or a small kithara , a musical instrument that Apollo or she herself invented . In Simon Vouet 's representations , two turtle - doves are eating seeds at her feet . Other representations may show her holding a golden arrow , reminding one of the \`\` eros '' , the feeling that she inspires in everybody , and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros , holding a torch ., The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.

This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use., In Greek mythology, Medea (\\"Mdeia\\") is a sorceress who was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and later wife to the hero Jason. In Euripides's play \\"Medea\\", Jason abandons Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers his daughter Glauce. The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children., Callimachus (\\"Kallimachos\\"; 310/305240 BC) was a native of the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya. He was a noted poet, critic and scholar at the Library of Alexandria and enjoyed the patronage of the EgyptianGreek Pharaohs Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Ptolemy III Euergetes. Although he was never made chief librarian, he was responsible for producing a bibliographic survey based upon the contents of the Library. This, his \\"Pinakes\\", 120 volumes long, provided the foundation for later work on the history of Greek literature. As one of the earliest critic-poets, he typifies Hellenistic scholarship., Etruscan religion and mythology were partly incorporated into classical Roman culture, including the Roman pantheon. The Senate adopted key elements of their religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent, long after the general population had forgotten the language. However, in the last years of the Roman Republic the religion began to fall out of favor and was satirized by such notable public figures as Marcus Tullius Cicero. The Julio-Claudians, especially Claudius, who claimed a remote Etruscan descent, maintained a knowledge of the language and religion for a short time longer, but this practice soon ceased. A number of canonical works in the Etruscan language survived until the middle of the first millennium AD, but were destroyed by the ravages of time, decree of the Roman Senate, and by fire., Jason (\\"Iásn\\") was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was famous for his role as the leader of the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea. He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side., The Argonautica (\\"Argonautika\\") is a Greek epic poem written by Apollonius Rhodius in the 3rd century BC. The only surviving Hellenistic epic, the \\"Argonautica\\" tells the myth of the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts to retrieve the Golden Fleece from remote Colchis. Their heroic adventures and Jason's relationship with the dangerous Colchian princess/sorceress Medea were already well known to Hellenistic audiences, which enabled Apollonius to go beyond a simple narrative, giving it a scholarly emphasis suitable to the times. It was the age of the great Library of Alexandria and his epic incorporates his researches in geography, ethnography, comparative religion and Homeric literature. However, his main contribution to the epic tradition lies in his development of the love between hero and heroine he seems to have been the first narrative poet to study \\"the pathology of love\\". His \\"Argonautica\\" had a profound impact on Latin poetry. It was translated by Varro Atacinus and imitated by Valerius Flaccus. It influenced Catullus and Ovid and it provided Virgil with a model for his Roman epic, the \\"Aeneid\\"., Gaius Valerius Flaccus (Setinus Balbus) (in English: ; died c. AD 90) was a Roman poet who flourished in the \\"Silver Age\\" under the emperors Vespasian and Titus and wrote a Latin \\"Argonautica\\" that owes a great deal to Apollonius of Rhodes' more famous epic. Life. He has been identified on insufficient grounds with a poet friend of Martial (1.61.76), a native of Padua, and in needy circumstances; but as he was a member of the College of Fifteen, who had charge of the Sibylline books (1.5), he must have been well off. The subscription of the Vatican manuscript, which adds the name Setinus Balbus, points to his having been a native of Setia in Latium. The only ancient writer who mentions him is Quintilian (10.1.90), who laments his recent death as a great loss; as Quintilian's work was finished about 90 AD, this gives a limit for the death of Flaccus., MusE is computer software, a sequencer for Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and audio, with recording and editing abilities. It was originally written by Werner Schweer and now is developed by the Muse development team. It is free software released under the GNU General Public License., In Greek mythology, Leto (\\"Lt\\"; , \\"Lt\\" in Dorian Greek, etymology and meaning disputed) is a daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe, the sister of Asteria, and the mother, by Zeus, of Apollo and Artemis., Apollonius of Rhodes (\\"Apollnios Rhódios\\" fl. first half of 3rd century BCE), is best known as the author of the \\"Argonautica\\", an epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. The poem is one of the few extant examples of the epic genre and it was both innovative and influential, providing Ptolemaic Egypt with a \\"cultural mnemonic\\" or national \\"archive of images\\", and offering the Latin poets Virgil and Gaius Valerius Flaccus a model for their own epics. His other poems, which survive only in small fragments, concerned the beginnings or foundations of cities, such as Alexandria and Cnidusplaces of interest to the Ptolemies, whom he served as a scholar and librarian at the Library of Alexandria. A literary dispute with Callimachus, another Alexandrian librarian/poet, is a topic much discussed by modern scholars since it is thought to give some insight into their poetry, although there is very little evidence that there ever was such a dispute between the two men. In fact almost nothing at all is known about Apollonius and even his connection with Rhodes is a matter for speculation. Once considered a mere imitator of Homer, and therefore a failure as a poet, his reputation has been enhanced by recent studies, with an emphasis on the special characteristics of Hellenistic poets as scholarly heirs of a long literary tradition writing at a unique time in history., The Aeneid is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed., A kouros (plural kouroi) is the modern term given to free-standing ancient Greek sculptures which first appear in the Archaic period in Greece and represent nude male youths. In Ancient Greek \\"kouros\\" means \\"youth, boy, especially of noble rank\\". The term \\"kouros\\" was first proposed for what were previously thought to be depictions of Apollo by V. I. Leonardos in 1895 in relation to the youth from Keratea, and adopted by Henri Lechat as a generic term for the standing male figure in 1904. Such statues are found across the Greek-speaking world; the preponderance of these were found in sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, Boeotia, alone. These free-standing sculptures were typically marble, but the form is also rendered in limestone, wood, bronze, ivory and terracotta. They are typically life-sized, though early colossal examples are up to 3 meters tall., Publius Vergilius Maro (traditional dates October 15, 70 BC September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him., Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars., Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , \\"Apolln\\"; Doric: , \\"Apelln\\"; Arcadocypriot: , \\"Apeiln\\"; Aeolic: , \\"Aploun\\") is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the \\"kouros\\" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \\"Apulu\\"., Publius Terentius Varro Atacinus (82 BC c. 35 BC) was a Roman poet, more polished in his style than the more famous and learned Varro Reatinus, his contemporary, and therefore more widely read by the Augustan writers. He was born in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, the southern part of Gaul with its capital at Narbonne, on the river Atax (now the Aude), for his cognomen \\"Atacinus\\" indicates his birthplace. Only fragments of his works survive. His first known works are \\"Bellum sequanicum\\", a poem on Julius Caesar's campaign against Ariovistus, and some satires; these should not be confused with the \\"Menippean Satires\\" of the other Varro, of which some 600 fragments survive.

Question: \\"Why does Callimaco pretend to be the one being kidnapped?\\" Response: \\"Because he wanted to sleep with Lucrezia\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question in a detailed and long manner. Here's a more detailed and long answer: Callimaco pretends to be the one being kidnapped for several reasons. Firstly, he is infatuated with Lucrezia's beauty and deeply desires to sleep with her. By disguising himself as the stranger to be kidnapped, he can get access to Lucrezia in a situation where her husband, Nicia, intentionally puts her in bed with another man. This way, Callimaco can get close to Lucrezia without having to face the consequences of an illicit affair. Secondly, Callimaco's strategy is designed to deceive Nicia and exploit his gullibility. Nicia, being desperate for an heir, falls for the elaborate scheme concocted by Callimaco and Ligurio. By manipulating Nicia into believing that the potion made from the Mandrake Root would help Lucrezia conceive but also be deadly for the first man to sleep with her, Callimaco ensures that Nicia would be willing to go along with the plan to kidnap a stranger. In this sense, Callimaco's deception allows him to take advantage of Nicia's desperation and his wife's loyalty. Finally, Callimaco's plan to disguise himself as the kidnapped stranger helps him maintain control over the entire situation. Since he is the mastermind behind the plot, he wants to ensure that everything goes according to his design. By being the one kidnapped, Callimaco can directly influence how the situation unfolds and keep any unexpected variables from interfering with his ultimate goal – to sleep with Lucrezia and, as revealed towards the end of the story, ultimately win her heart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: - The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the dishwasher process is the preparation and loading of the dishes. This step is crucial in ensuring that the dishwasher functions efficiently and effectively throughout the entire cycle. Before using the dishwasher, it is essential to scrape off any large food particles from the dishes, pots, and pans. This helps prevent food debris from clogging the dishwasher's filter and spray arms. In some cases, pre-rinsing the dishes can also be helpful; however, modern dishwashers are typically designed to handle small food particles without pre-rinsing. It is important to note that excessively pre-rinsing the dishes may eliminate the enzymes and surfactants in the detergent from effectively adhering to the dishes, consequently reducing the efficiency of the dishwasher. Loading the dishwasher correctly is also a crucial aspect of the first step. To do this, you must ensure that dishes are properly placed in the racks to optimize the water spray coverage. Place larger items like pots and pans on the bottom rack, facing downward and toward the spray arms. Smaller plates, saucers, and bowls should be loaded into the top rack, arranged at an angle to allow the water to run off freely. Glasses and mugs can also be placed on the top rack, taking care to avoid overcrowding and prevent the items from touching or clinking together, which might cause breakages. Cutlery can be placed in the designated cutlery basket, mixing the items to prevent nesting or sticking together, ensuring that both sharp and blunt utensils receive adequate water coverage for proper cleaning. Be cautious with sharp knives, as they can damage the dishwasher's interior or pose a safety risk during unloading.

Is Since regaining independence, Estonia has pursued a foreign policy of close co-operation with its Western European partners. a good answer to this question?","completion":"While the statement provided gives a brief insight into Estonia's foreign policy approach since regaining independence, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the most important foreign policy priorities. Estonia's foreign policy, like any other nation, is shaped by several factors and serves multiple objectives. Thus, to provide a detailed and long answer to this question, it is essential to break down the various elements of Estonia's foreign policy priorities. Here are some key components of Estonia's foreign policy since regaining its independence: 1. Integration with Western European institutions: Estonia has worked towards building closer ties with major Western European political and economic institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The country has strived to benefit from the wealth of knowledge, resources, and stability provided by these organizations. Estonia joined the EU in 2004, and its membership in NATO dates back to the same year. 2. Strengthening regional security: Security and stability have been of paramount importance in Estonia's foreign policy. As a Baltic country with a complex history, Estonia has placed significant emphasis on regional security and cooperation initiatives. Estonia's NATO membership reflects the importance it places on its defense and overall security. 3. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation: Estonia has actively sought to foster strong ties with various countries on bilateral and multilateral levels. For instance, the country has strengthened its relationship with its Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Lithuania, and other Nordic countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Norway. This cooperation encompasses various sectors, including trade, cultural exchange, and efforts to combat common security threats. 4. Cybersecurity and digital innovation: Estonia has carved out a global reputation as a leading digital country and has, therefore, focused on promoting digital cooperation and innovation as a foreign policy priority. The country has actively participated in international discussions on cybersecurity and governance and has pursued collaborative projects with various partners to ensure an open, secure, and resilient cyberspace. 5. Promotion of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law: Estonia has positioned itself as an active defender and promoter of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, both regionally and internationally. The country often supports human rights initiatives in international organizations like the United Nations, the EU, and the Council of Europe and extends technical assistance to countries in need such as those in the Eastern Partnership initiative. 6. Climate change and environmental protection: In acknowledgment of the global threats posed by climate change and environmental degradation, Estonia has participated in various international endeavors aimed at combating these challenges. This component of its foreign policy includes engagement in international climate negotiations, adopting sustainable development goals, and integrating green initiatives into its economic and social development strategies. In summary, a comprehensive answer to the question would include multiple aspects of Estonia's foreign policy priorities, including integration with Western institutions, regional security, cooperation with neighboring countries, focus on cybersecurity, promotion of democratic values, and environmental protection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose vocal talent had been recognized when she was a chils? , can you please find it? Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea.

Hypothesis: Przekosniak was shy and didn't want anyone to know him. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements present in the premise and the hypothesis. Premise key elements: - Przekosniak sending SMSs to various influential individuals. - Przekosniak posing as an admirer. - Recipients include people from various fields and acquaintances. Hypothesis key elements: - Przekosniak being shy. - Przekosniak not wanting anyone to know him. Step 2: Compare the key elements in the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mentions that Przekosniak is posing as an \\"admirer\\" while contacting influential people, acquaintances, and a lady from the cheese stick shop. This suggests that Przekosniak may be trying to maintain anonymity. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that Przekosniak is shy and doesn't want anyone to know him. While the action of posing as an \\"admirer\\" in the premise indicates a possible attempt to remain anonymous, it is not enough to conclude that Przekosniak is shy. Conclusion: The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, as the action of posing as an \\"admirer\\" could result from various reasons, such as privacy, strategy, or experimentation, and not only shyness. There might be a partial entailment, but it's insufficient to draw a definite conclusion regarding Przekosniak's shyness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Outback Movie plot: A white koala named Johnny is teased about his color so he joins a traveling circus with the help of Hamish, a Tasmanian Devil, and a Higgens, a monkey photographer. He is disappointed that he is part of the freak show instead of the main acts in the big tent. The top act is \\"Wild Bushman\\" who takes all the audience from the freak show. Johnny checks out the act and ends up part of the act by accident and saved by The Wild Bushman. While traveling to a new location Their wagon train car becomes unattached and crashes in the desert of \\"The Outback\\". On their quest to go to the next location of the traveling circus, \\"Precipice Lake\\", they come upon a billabong, the oasis of the Outback. They witness from their cliff location that a pack of dingos (and a thylacine) are chasing a bilby but rescued by a kangaroo, a wombat army, and a vine-swinging female koala talented at throwing a boomerang. Boris, a vulture, reveals that Bog intends on taking over the Billabong. When their rescue goes wrong and the dingos threaten to take over, the rock Johnny is on breaks free and he slides down the cliff and ends up rolling on top of a boulder that chases the dingos away. Hamish introduces the now-famous white koala as \\"Koala Kid\\". Miranda, the boomerang expert koala, is not impressed but Johnny watches her from a tree as she practices. When noticed, Miranda breaks the branch he is on with her boomerang and complains about him watching in secret. He tries to lie his way out of that accusation but ends up suggesting he is an expert at the boomerang... and proven wrong when offered to try it himself. Hamish's plan is to take photos of Johnny doing heroic stuff and make him famous as Koala Kid so when they get back to the circus, they can get in the main act rather then the freak show (Hamish will make more money).

Johnny's unintentional victory over the pack of dingos, along with the help of his new friends like Hamish and Higgens, and the native animals like the vine-swinging koala Miranda, showcases that while Wild Bushman might be the top act in the circus, Johnny's experience in the Outback strengthens him to face more serious threats such as Bog, the giant crocodile.

It's impossible to say Véronique Vendell, born Véronique Duraffourd on 21 July 1942, is a French actress who has worked in various French and German film productions. She is best known for her roles in Peter Glenville's \\"Becket\\" and Sam Peckinpah's \\"Cross of Iron\\" and its sequel \\"Breakthrough\\". However, there is no available information on her mental health, particularly regarding whether she suffered from extreme anxiety or not. Anxiety, commonly experienced by many people, can manifest as an occasional feeling of unease or nervousness. For some, it can escalate into a persistent or severe mental health disorder that can have debilitating consequences on their personal and professional lives. Actors, like the general population, may experience anxiety or mental health issues at various points in their lives, as they can be affected by a plethora of factors such as stress, traumatic events, or genetic predisposition. Despite Véronique Vendell's success in the film industry, it would be improper to draw definitive conclusions about her mental health, specifically any experiences of extreme anxiety, without the presence of concrete evidence. Public information is scarce about her personal life, and it is important to respect her privacy unless she or a reliable source has disclosed any information on this matter. In conclusion, it is impossible to determine if Véronique Vendell suffered from extreme anxiety based on the available information about her career and roles in various productions. Mental health is a complex subject, and it is crucial to make inferences solely on substantiated evidence or personal testimonies rather than making assumptions based on someone's career trajectory or the roles they have played."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the key features that make this game so appealing to its diverse population of gamers is its multi-player servers, where connections and communities form around shared interests, goals, and endeavors. In this article, we will delve into the process of finding a Minecraft server that you really like, introducing yourself on the server, and setting a good example to leave a lasting impression on fellow players. Step 1: Finding a Minecraft Server to Call Home Just as in the real world, finding the ideal Minecraft server to settle into requires exploration and research. Begin by considering what you value most in a server, taking into account aspects such as game modes, themed worlds, the level of creativity and complexity, and the size and demographic of the community. Websites, such as Minecraft Server List and Planet Minecraft, can help narrow down your search from thousands of available servers. These platforms provide server descriptions, reviews, and ratings, allowing you to select a server that best aligns with your preferences and playstyle. Step 2: Introducing Yourself to the Community Now that you've chosen a server, it's time to introduce yourself to the community. Most Minecraft servers come equipped with in-game chat, forums, and Discord channels, making it easy to communicate with other players. To make a positive and lasting first impression, craft a concise and friendly introductory message that touches on your interests, goals, and what drew you to the server. While it's important to showcase your enthusiasm and authenticity, remember to maintain respect for others and their creations, as this is vital in fostering strong, supportive relationships within the community. Step 3: Making a Good Example of Yourself With your introduction done, it's time to contribute positively to the server and become a valuable community member. Engage with others through collaborative projects, assisting new players, participating in server events, or sharing resources and advice. By doing so, you will not only grow as a Minecraft player but also foster camaraderie and goodwill. Moreover, being a good listener and receptive to feedback is crucial in establishing yourself as a trustworthy and approachable player. As you make friends and interact with various players, try absorbing some of their knowledge and incorporating it into your own gaming experience. Keep the server rules in mind, report any inappropriate behavior, and encourage others to do the same, as this will create a safe and enjoyable environment for all users. Conclusion Finding a Minecraft server that resonates with your interests, presenting yourself in a friendly and respectful manner, and contributing positively to the community are integral steps in creating lasting bonds and optimizing your gaming experience. The world of Minecraft is vast and brimming with opportunities to connect with others who share your passion for the game.

Question: Process: - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different. suppose when there is a tsunami happens, how will it affect the wind levels decrease on the ocean. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"A tsunami can indirectly impact a step of the process described, which involves the interaction between waves, sediments, and the shoreline. It is important to understand the dynamics of tsunamis and their effects on coastal areas to fully comprehend the perturbation they may cause on the wind levels and the process discussed. A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves usually caused by an underwater disturbance, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption. These massive waves travel at high speeds across the open ocean and can cause significant destruction upon reaching coastal areas. The energy of a tsunami can drastically alter the coastal environment, causing flooding, erosion, and sediment transport. In the context of the process mentioned, the presence of a tsunami would likely have an indirect impact on various steps. The increased wave energy from the tsunami not only intensifies the water's force against rocks and sand, but also carries a much greater amount of sediment and debris. This higher force and increased sediment load can cause additional weathering and erosion of rocks on the shoreline and the displacement of sand and other particles. The question about wind levels decreasing during a tsunami suggests a potential interaction between the wind and ocean currents. However, it is essential to understand that tsunamis primarily result from geological events and are less influenced by local wind conditions. Furthermore, a tsunami may not have a direct impact on wind levels, but it may cause short-term disruptions to local wind patterns due to its significant impact on the ocean and coastal areas. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation that results from a tsunami would indirectly impact steps in the process described. A tsunami may not directly affect wind levels, but its immense energy can intensify the interaction between waves, sediments, and the shoreline, causing a significant impact on coastal environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Craig saw a UFO and asked if Donald had seen it but","completion":"Donald was busy on his phone, completely oblivious to the extraordinary sighting. Craig, unable to contain his excitement, rushed toward his friend, grabbing his arm and gesturing toward the sky. \\"Donald, man, you have to see this!\\" Craig exclaimed, pointing to the peculiar object hovering above them. Donald, startled by the sudden enthusiasm, reluctantly pocketed his phone and turned his attention toward the strange occurrence. Up in the sky, they both observed a metallic, saucer-shaped object silently gliding through the air. It was unlike anything they'd ever seen before, emitting a soft, pulsating glow that alternated between shades of blue and green. The surface of the UFO appeared to be smooth and polished, with no discernible markings or windows to help decipher its origin or purpose. Donald stared in disbelief, his skepticism melting away as he watched the object perform several maneuvers that defied the principles of physics. It darted from one side to the other at impossible speeds, leaving behind a temporary trail of warping light that seemed to bend the very fabric of reality. His heart raced as he realized the magnitude of what they were witnessing. As the UFO continued its aerial ballet, Craig couldn't help but wonder about the intentions of its inhabitants. Were they friend or foe? Did they come in peace, or did they harbor sinister motives? He remembered the countless science fiction stories he'd consumed as a child, where extraterrestrial visitors often held humanity's fate in their hands. Donald, on the other hand, couldn't help but think about the potential technological advancements that could be gleaned from this encounter. He envisioned propulsion systems that defied gravity, energy sources that could replace fossil fuels, and communication devices that transcended space and time. He knew that if humans could somehow make contact with the beings controlling this UFO, their world would change forever. The two friends stood there, frozen in awe, as the mysterious object continued to hover above them. Suddenly, the UFO emitted a blinding flash of light that enveloped the entire area. Both Craig and Donald shielded their eyes, feeling as if they were momentarily thrust into another dimension. As the light dissipated, they cautiously opened their eyes to find that the UFO had vanished without a trace. As if it had never been there, the sky returned to its regular appearance, leaving the two men grappling with what they had just experienced. Donald, the eternal skeptic, turned to Craig and shakily said, \\"I don't know what just happened, but I can't deny that we've just witnessed something extraordinary.\\" Craig nodded in agreement, knowing that their lives would never be the same after this encounter. The two friends walked away from the site, unable to let go of the overwhelming feelings of wonder and fear that now surged through them. They knew that they might never get the answers they sought about the UFO and its otherworldly passengers, but one thing was for certain – their understanding of the universe had been irreversibly changed. As word of their sighting spread, others would soon come forward with their own accounts of mysterious objects in the sky. The phenomenon would capture the imagination of people around the world, sparking countless investigations and debates about the existence of extraterrestrial life. For Craig and Donald, however, their encounter with the UFO would remain a deeply personal experience – a shared moment in time that would forever bind them together, serving as a reminder that there was far more to this vast universe than they could ever have imagined."},{"prompt":"Definition: The task is about translation from Telugu to English.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The Tasmanian devil is a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter, spending the days in dense bush or in a hole.[64] It has been speculated that nocturnalism may have been adopted to avoid predation by eagles and humans.[65] Young devils are predominantly crepuscular.[66] There is no evidence of torpor.[67] Young devils can climb trees, but this becomes more difficult as they grow larger.[68][69] Devils can scale trees of trunk diameter larger than 40 cm (16 in), which tend to have no small side branches to hang onto, up to a height of around 2.5–3 m (8.2–9.8 ft). Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a height of 4 metres (13.1 ft), and can climb a tree to 7 m (23 ft) if it is not vertical.[70] Adult devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape.[71] Devils can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are 50 metres (160 ft) in width, including icy cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically. I am facing a new situation today: The scientists examined both the Eastern and the Western slopes of the mountain. They reached the conclusion that the Western slope was inhabited by many more adult Tasmanian devils than the Eastern slope. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which slope had more instances of devils eating young devils? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it can be inferred that the Western slope likely had more instances of devils eating young devils. The background article states that adult Tasmanian devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, and this climbing behavior of young devils may be an adaptation to allow them to escape from adults. The new situation indicates that the Western slope was inhabited by many more adult Tasmanian devils than the Eastern slope. With a higher population of adult devils on the Western slope, the probability of instances where adult devils are hungry and resort to eating young devils would likely be higher on the Western slope as compared to the Eastern slope. Furthermore, as the young devils display climbing behavior to escape adult devils, a higher population of adult devils on the Western slope may lead to an increased need for young devils to climb trees as a means of self-preservation, which could be an indication of more instances of attempted predation by adult devils on the Western slope. It is important to note, however, that the information provided does not give a definite answer to the question, and other factors such as availability of prey, vegetation, and overall population density may also contribute to the frequency of instances where adult devils eat young devils. Additional research and data would be necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion."},{"prompt":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What does Mr. Porter tell the sympathetic researcher about himself?, using the article: Dr. Edwards arrives at a secluded island laboratory to examine Mr. Porter.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter. I’m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. Would rad A have longer or shorter wavelengths than rad B? Hint: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the information step by step: 1. Mark is studying the effect of the Sun's radiations (rad A) on Earth. 2. He studies Earth's radiations (rad B). 3. Longer wavelength radiations produce heat. 4. Earth receives energy from the Sun (solar radiation or sunlight, which is rad A) and emits radiation back into space (rad B). 5. The hint tells us that Earth emits radiation at longer wavelengths that we cannot see, and part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. From this information, we can conclude that rad A (Sun's radiations) have shorter wavelengths than rad B (Earth's radiations), as Earth emits radiation back into space at longer wavelengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The EU 's agriculture representative in Washington said EU ministers were invited but canceled because the union is wrapping up talks on agricultural reform . Are these sentences conveying the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are conveying the same meaning. Both sentences communicate that Gerry Kiely, an EU agriculture representative in Washington, has stated that EU ministers were invited to an event or meeting, but they ended up canceling their attendance. The reason for the cancellation is that the European Union is in the process of finalizing discussions on agricultural reform. There are some differences in the choice of words and phrasing between the two sentences, but the core message remains the same: - The first sentence explicitly mentions Gerry Kiely and his role, while the second sentence starts with a relatively more general reference to the EU's agriculture representative in Washington. This distinction is minor, though, as both sentences ultimately refer to the same individual. - The first sentence uses the term \\"closing talks,\\" whereas the second sentence uses \\"wrapping up talks.\\" Both expressions indicate that the EU is concluding its discussions on agricultural reform. Although these phrases might have slightly different nuances, their overall meaning in this context is the same. In summary, the two sentences present the same information using slightly different wordings but effectively convey the same message."},{"prompt":"Q:What type of details about erik evju can be gathered from the following bio?

Review: This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of Great Britain. \\"The Young Victoria\\" has amazing production. Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. The extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make \\"The Young Victoria\\" very impressive. I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle, while from Melbourne's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips. Story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device But the West Midlands team have come a long way since their formation in 1991 and can make history on Saturday by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. It will not be easy against the relative giants of FC United of Manchester but, whatever happens at the Aspray Arena, it will be another chapter in a remarkable story. Sporting Khalsa are fifth in the Midland League Premier Division, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87. On Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round. The winners will earn £12,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013. \\"Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,\\" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer. \\"We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here. \\"There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting. Grass verges had to be dug and stone had to be put down to level it off. \\"At our level we can't afford to pay people to clear the site. We rely on volunteers. \\"We sent one email out and had around 20 people turn up, including the manager and some of the players.\\" Prior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round. On Saturday, a combination of local interest and FC United's healthy away following - many of whom are intent on making a trip to nearby Dudley to see the statue of legendary Manchester United and England player Duncan Edwards - could see three times that many turn up. Normal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff. \\"We usually print the programmes ourselves on a colour printer,\\" Grewa told BBC Sport. \\"But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done. \\"We have gone up from two stewards to 30. \\"We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Food will be available, though.\\" Ah yes, the now famous curry house, located within the 4-4-2 bar adjacent to the ground, open on match and non-matchdays. \\"We just thought it would be an add-on,\\" said Grewa. \\"We feed the players but football comes first. Everything here is working towards improving the football side.\\" It is safe to assume neither Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger nor Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood were required for landscaping duties before last season's FA Cup final. But that was one of the jobs keeping Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe busy this week after answering the call to help create the access route. Building is nothing new for this Black Country club, sandwiched between Wolverhampton and Walsall, whose story of traversing one side of Noose Lane, where it all began in 1991, to the other, where the Asprey Arena is located, is a compelling one, even if it comes with a sad reminder that some racial stereotypes still run deep. Sporting Khalsa emerged from a group of a dozen Sikh lads who would meet on Willenhall Memorial Park for a kickabout at weekends. Playing standards varied. Passion for the game was in them all. Sporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved. In 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League. Decisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games. Sporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club. But it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender. They bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject. \\"There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,\\" said Grewa. \\"We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves. \\"You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there. \\"It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true. \\"We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody. \\"We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.\\" The club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club. \\"We want to get to the National League,\\" said Grewa. \\"Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that. \\"The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally. \\"Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.\\" At 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop. By any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team. They do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup. Saturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15. The players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments. \\"I am a Manchester United fan,\\" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season. \\"I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life. \\"But let's not kid ourselves. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred. \\"AFC Fylde are in the same league as FC United. They beat a team in our league 9-0. I don't want that to happen to us.\\"","completion":"The West Midlands football team, Sporting Khalsa, has the opportunity to make history by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, if they win their match against FC United of Manchester. The team has grown tremendously since its formation in 1991 and currently hold fifth place in the Midland League Premier Division, which is the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. If they win their match, they will earn £12,500 and be included in the first-round draw alongside previous winners, Portsmouth and Wigan. In preparation for the expected 2,000 spectators, the volunteer-run club had to clear an access route for marquees as their bar is not large enough. Regardless of the game's outcome, it will mark a significant milestone in the clubs history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ross James Brawn OBE (born 23 November 1954) is the Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports and technical director. He is also a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal. He had worked for a number of Formula One teams, serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams. He took a sabbatical from the sport in 2007 but returned to F1 for the 2008 season as Team Principal of Honda. His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Sir Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team's wind tunnel. Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley's design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. However, with the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the F1 paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the Haas team left F1 at the end of the 1986 season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the 1987 and 1988 seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in 1989. Later in 1989 Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

Jesús está ofreciendo compartir nuestras cargas.)","completion":"The yoke is a way of moving the load with the help of someone else. Jesus is offering to share our burdens. In this context, the yoke refers to a device traditionally used to link two animals, like oxen, together, allowing them to work in tandem and distribute the weight of the load evenly between them. This helped make the task of moving heavy loads more manageable and efficient. In a metaphorical sense, Jesus is offering to share our burdens and help us carry the weight of our struggles and difficulties. By inviting us to take on His yoke, he is offering support, guidance, and comfort in times of need. The message Jesus conveys is an essential aspect of Christian teachings, emphasizing the role of faith and belief in overcoming challenges that may seem insurmountable at first. This concept of sharing burdens also emphasizes the importance of community and cooperation. By working together and helping one another, people can face adversity more effectively and find strength in unity. The metaphor of the yoke helps illustrate how interconnected we all are and how leaning on one another and accepting help can make tasks more manageable and less overwhelming. In the context of Christianity, this idea is particularly pertinent, as believers often turn to God and their religious communities for guidance, support, and encouragement. When faced with trials or in need of spiritual sustenance, the symbolic act of taking on the yoke of Jesus can provide a comforting reminder that we are never truly alone in our struggles. As humans, we can find solace in knowing that there is a greater power willing to help carry our burdens and provide the strength we need to prevail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometimes, a \\"show don't tell\\" approach works best. Consider spending a few days showing your parents you're responsible. If your parents see you're maturing, they might be more willing to allow you to have extra freedom. Most parents expect that kids will reach a point where they crave more independence. However, understand parents have worries themselves. They will want to make sure they know where you are at all times. You can ease some of their potential anxiety by showcasing your growing maturity and independence. Do your chores without being asked. Complete your homework as soon as you get home from school. Be upfront about what's happening in your day-to-day life by sharing details about school and your social life without prompting. Use \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" at the dinner table. After showing your parents your increasing maturity, pick a time to talk about the sleepover. Choose a time that's flexible and works for both you and your parents. That is, don't bring up the issue at 11 o'clock at night when you know your parents have to be up for work in the morning. Instead, bring it up a little after dinner on a weeknight. Try to be as mature as possible when bringing up the subject. Say something courteous like, \\"Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.\\" Remember your manners as this will impress your parents. Try something like, \\"Could we please have a talk after dinner tonight?\\" Your parents may react negatively if you bring up other people's families, your friends, or your siblings. Keep your focus on yourself and your situation. You may be tempted to say something like, \\"Miranda's parents are letting her go!\\" or \\"You let Jamie go to sleepover's when he was my age.\\" Such statements are likely to rub your parents the wrong way. It's irrelevant what other people are doing. Your parents have made rules with your specific needs and safety in mind. Talk about yourself and the reasons you are mature enough to attend a sleepover. Point to things like your grades and your behavior. Say something like, \\"I usually get decent grades and I stay out of trouble. I feel like you should have some trust in me.\\" You can also explain to your parents why you want to go to the sleepover. Try something like, \\"I really like hanging out with Sophie and her friends at school. I feel like it would be a lot of fun hanging out with them outside of the classroom and this is a good opportunity.\\" Parents usually want to know where you are, what you're doing, and who you're with. Withholding this information could make your parents less likely to grant you permission to attend a sleepover. Be upfront about where the sleepover is, who will be there, and what events and activities will take place. Your parents will feel a lot more comfortable granting you permission if they know exactly what's going on. If your parents still say \\"No,\\" it can be helpful for you to ask them why. Try not to yell or get frustrated as this can result in an argument. Instead, ask what their main concerns are. Wait a few days until you've both cooled down and you've had time to figure out how to address these concerns. Then, bring the event up again and see if the discussion goes over any better.","completion":"This article suggests that in order to discuss a sleepover with your parents, you should first showcase your maturity and responsibility. Completing chores, doing homework promptly, and being open about your daily life can help demonstrate your growing independence. Timing is important; find a suitable moment to broach the subject, such as after dinner on a weeknight. When discussing the sleepover, maintain a focus on your situation and avoid bringing up friends or siblings as examples. Emphasize your personal traits, such as good grades and responsible behavior, and share the reasons you want to attend the sleepover, including the positive aspects of bonding with friends outside of school. Providing information about the sleepover's location, attendees, and activities planned can help assuage your parents' concerns. If your parents say no, calmly ask them about their concerns and take some time to address these before revisiting the topic. This approach demonstrates maturity and may improve the chances of receiving permission for the sleepover."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

We have the equation: 30536 = 1044*n + 12009 - 40981 2. Our goal is to find the value of 'n'. First, let's add and subtract the numbers on the right side of the equation: 3. 1044*n + 12009 - 40981 = 1044*n - 28972 (I just did 12009 - 40981) Now, we have the equation: 30536 = 1044*n - 28972 Next, let's get rid of the -28972, by adding 28972 to both sides of the equation: 4. 30536 + 28972 = 1044*n 5. 59508 = 1044*n (I just did 30536 + 28972) Now, we have the equation: 59508 = 1044*n Finally, let's find 'n' by dividing both sides of the equation by 1044: 6. 59508 ÷ 1044 = n 7. n = 57 (I divided 59508 by 1044) So, the solution is n = 57!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While an international dispute causes tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the Discovery. Although the Soviet ship, the Leonov, will be ready before the American spacecraft Discovery Two, the Soviets need American astronauts to help board the Discovery and investigate the malfunction of the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, which caused the disaster. The US government agrees to a joint mission when it is determined that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before Discovery Two is ready. Floyd, along with Discovery designer Walter Curnow and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra, joins the Soviet mission. Upon arriving at Jupiter, the crew detect signs of life on Jupiter's seemingly barren moon Europa. They send an unmanned probe down to Europa to investigate the unusual readings, but just as it finds the source, a mysterious energy burst destroys the probe and its data. The \\"burst\\" then flies toward Jupiter. The Soviets believe the burst was simply electrostatic build-up, but Floyd suspects it was a warning to stay away from Europa. After surviving a dangerous braking maneuver around Jupiter's upper atmosphere, the Leonov crew find the abandoned Discovery floating in space.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: You need to make sure that people notice your attitude and one way to do that is to dress with the intent of showing how little you care, or by actively trying to piss people off. Wear things your parents won't approve of like clothing that doesn't fit you right, has inappropriate slogans on it, or is dirty and ripped. Create your own style. You want to make sure people know that you don't care what they think about you and one way to do that is to be obvious about crafting your own style. Remember, you don't just want to wear all black to show your attitude (anyone can do that), you want to make yourself unique. Piercings and tattoos are all the rage with the rebellious and those who are trying to really piss their parents off. You will need to be over 18, however, to get a tattoo or piercing without parental consent, unless you go to an disreputable place (and that's bad for things like infections, so it's not recommended. Body language is the perfect way to communicate how you're feeling. Showing the proper amount of attitude means using the right body language, so that other people know what's up. Cross your arms across your chest. While this is a defensive gesture, it can also be a gesture of irritation or boredom and can mean that you aren't interested in the person or persons you're with. Rolling eyes is a great way to express irritation or derision towards another person. Whatever they say make sure to roll your eyes, especially if you've gotten in trouble for breaking rules. Not making eye contact or making too much eye contact are good ways to show attitude. Not making eye contact can be really irritating to other people because it shows a lack of interest on your part. Making too much eye contact can be intimidating. Slamming doors and making a lot of angry noise (like playing angry music really loudly) can show your displeasure and disrupt everyone else's life. It's especially good to use this tactic after you've had an argument with an authority figure. Your room is your own personal realm and you get to rule it however you want, and that includes letting people (like your family) into it, when and if you choose to do so. Yell at family members who try to come into your room. Put signs on your door that it'll be instant death for anyone who tries to come into your room without your express invitation. If someone knocks on your door, tell them to \\"go away!\\" Don't filter the things that you say. If they're rude, so what? You're looking to have an attitude and an attitude means not caring how the things you do and say affect others. Point out the mistakes of others. When people screw up (especially adults like your parents or your teacher) make sure that you ridicule them for it. Say things like \\"Oh my god, mom, I can't believe you burnt dinner. Can't you do anything right?\\" Speaking your mind is a great skill to cultivate and it is also one that will serve you well if you're copping an attitude. If someone is wearing a truly hideous outfit, make sure that you tell them so. If your friend is acting like an idiot over a boy, make sure that you mention it loudly. This is an important part of having an attitude, because the attitude comes from the belief that you are better than everyone else (hence pointing out mistakes, and shooting down suggestions). Act like people's time and energy belongs to you (especially people like your parents; definitely take them for granted). Act like you know everything. When someone tries to change your mind or convince you otherwise, simply laugh at them or roll your eyes and walk away. Never say \\"please\\" or \\"thank you.\\" These are phrases that are way to polite and mannered for your attitude, so you'll want to avoid them at all costs. Never try to help out around the house and definitely don't try to give your teachers at school a hand, even with something simple like holding the door for them. You will want to make sure that you're hanging out with people who support your attitude, which basically means hanging out with people that your parents won't like or approve of; people who have as much attitude as you do. You can easily find these people at school, as long as you cultivate an air of disinterest in them and in everything, they'll be dying to be friends with you. You definitely want to make sure that the people you're hanging out with are people who aren't going to tell on you to your parents that you stayed out past curfew or your teacher that you haven't done your homework all year.","completion":"The article discusses ways for individuals to display a rebellious attitude by adopting a non-conformist manner of dressing, speaking, and behaving that intentionally annoys others. They suggest wearing inappropriate clothing, creating a unique personal style, and considering piercings and tattoos to defy their parents' approval. Moreover, the article encourages the use of specific body language, such as crossing arms, rolling eyes, and playing with eye contact to show disinterest or irritation. Another technique discussed is making loud, angry noises (e.g., slamming doors, playing loud music) to catch attention and disrupt others' lives, especially after a disagreement with an authority figure. In addition, the article advises creating a personal space by putting up signs and yelling at family members who try to enter without permission. The article also emphasizes the importance of not filtering thoughts and words and pointing out others' mistakes, as this can make one feel superior. This can be done by speaking one's mind and not being concerned about offending others. Additionally, the article recommends acting entitled and knowledgeable, refraining from using polite phrases like \\"please\\" and \\"thank you,\\" and never offering help. Lastly, the article suggests surrounding oneself with people who support a rebellious attitude, especially those who will protect an individual's secrets and have a similar outlook on life.

Question: How much energy can be passed along each trophic level I found the following answer on Google: The word trophic derives from the Greek τροφή (trophē) referring to food or feeding. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about how much energy can be passed along each trophic level. While it is true that the word \\"trophic\\" is derived from the Greek word τροφή (trophē) meaning food or feeding, this information is not relevant to understanding the energy transfer in trophic levels. Allow me to provide a detailed answer on energy transfer within trophic levels: In an ecosystem, energy flows from one organism to another through a sequence of feeding relationships known as the food chain. Each step in this chain is called a trophic level. Within a typical food chain, trophic levels can be broadly assigned into groups such as primary producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and so on. The energy transfer between trophic levels is not entirely efficient. Only a small portion of the energy that is consumed by organisms at one trophic level is passed on to the next level. According to the \\"10% rule,\\" on average, about 10% of the energy from the previous trophic level is transferred to the next level. The remaining energy is lost at each level due to factors such as respiration, heat loss, excretion, and decomposition. For example, let's consider a simple food chain involving plants, herbivores, and carnivores: 1. Primary producers (plants) convert sunlight into chemical energy through a process called photosynthesis. Let's assume they capture and store 1000 units of energy. 2. Primary consumers (herbivores) feed on plants. Only 10% (100 units) of the energy from the plants is passed on to the herbivores, as the rest is consumed by the plants for their own growth and sustenance. 3. Secondary consumers (carnivores) feed on primary consumers. Following the 10% rule, only 10% (10 units) of the energy from the herbivores is transferred to the carnivores. This pattern continues throughout the food chain, with only a small portion of energy being transferred to the next trophic level at each step. As a result, the total number of trophic levels in a food chain is usually limited. Having fewer trophic levels ensures that a higher percentage of energy can be transferred to the top consumers, such as apex predators. In summary, the concept of trophic levels is essential in understanding energy transfer in ecosystems. The provided answer was not accurate regarding the energy transfer between trophic levels. The actual transfer of energy is approximately 10% of the energy from one trophic level to the next, with the remaining energy being lost through processes such as respiration, heat loss, and excretion."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","completion":"In battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch. The temperature in group A's territory on day one was 5 °C, which is quite cool. Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to regulate the temperature and humidity within their nests through the construction of thatch on the openings of their nests. In colder temperatures, these ants are likely to create more openings in their nest thatch to allow for better air circulation inside the nest. The increased air circulation aids in raising the internal temperature of the nest to maintain a suitable environment for the ants and their fungus gardens, which they cultivate for food. This approach also helps to prevent condensation from forming within the nest, which could lead to harmful mold growth. Conversely, in warmer temperatures (such as the 22 °C experienced on battle day two), these ants would construct fewer openings in the nest thatch to reduce air circulation and maintain a stable, comfortable temperature within the nest. Similarly, on battle day three, when group A's territory experienced low air humidity, they would likely create more openings to increase air circulation and maintain proper humidity levels within the nest to keep a suitable environment. On the other hand, on battle day four, when the territory had high air humidity, they may reduce the number of openings to minimize the amount of moisture entering the nest. In summary, given the cool temperature of 5 °C on battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch to regulate the nest's internal temperature and humidity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Uncertainty over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was further compounded Saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen. Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned. After the airline released a manifest of the 239 people on the plane, Austria denied that one of its citizens was on the flight as the list had stated. The Austrian citizen was safe and sound, and his passport had been stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said. Similarly, Italy's foreign ministry confirmed that no Italians were on the flight, even though an Italian was listed on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports that the Italian's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it. On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy. Maraldi's father, Walter, told police that he had just spoken to his son, who was fine and not on the missing flight, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media. Maraldi was vacationing in Thailand, his father said. The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.

Article: Our quarrel with efficiency is not that it gets things done, but that it is a thief of time when it leaves us no leisure to enjoy ourselves, and that it strains our nerves when we try to get things done perfectly. In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain both come out on the other side. --The Chinese's firm belief is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The pace of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling. But, worse than that, it imposes upon us a different conception of time as measured by the clock and eventually turns the human being into a clock himself. (This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand worker. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.)Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and full of excitement. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already. Every American adult is arranging his time on the pattern of the schoolboy - three o'clock for this, five o'clock for that, six-thirty for change of dress, six-fifty for entering the taxi, and seven o'clock for arriving at the destination. It just makes life not worth living. Question: The writer objects to efficiency mainly on the grounds that it _ .

Context: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Initialize a variable to store the maximum difference, let's call it max_diff and set it to 0. 2. Iterate through the list of integers, comparing each pair of numbers. 3. For each pair, find the absolute difference between the two numbers. 4. If the absolute difference is greater than the current value of max_diff, update max_diff to be the new absolute difference. 5. Continue this process until all pairs of numbers have been compared. 6. Once all pairs have been compared, max_diff will contain the largest possible absolute difference.

Along the way, she and her dad had fun by making up mountain songs. \\"All my friends like to stay inside playing computer games, but I like being outdoors best,\\" says Rebecca. Rebecca also enjoys swimming and skiing. The young climber doesn't plan to stay on flat land for long. She wants to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa. \\"And I would like to climb Mount Qomolangma one day, too,\\" she said. Question: Rebecca likes climbing probably because _ . - she doesn't get along well with her friends - her dad has a great influence on her - she likes making up mountain songs - she wants to climb Mount Kilimanjaro The answer is:","completion":"her dad has a great influence on her. Step 1: Read the article carefully to understand the context and gather information. Step 2: Identify the important points related to the question, such as Rebecca's activities, her motivations, and her relationship with her dad. Step 3: Analyze the potential answers to the question by comparing them to the information gathered from the article. Step 4: Determine the best answer based on the information provided. Justification: - The article states that Rebecca took her first trip up a mountain in her dad's backpack when she was just six months old, indicating her dad has played a significant role in her interest in climbing. - The article doesn't mention any issues with her friends, and it quotes her as saying she likes being outdoors while her friends prefer playing computer games. - Making up mountain songs is mentioned as a fun activity during the climbs, but the article doesn't specifically point to that as a primary source of her enjoyment or preference for climbing. - Rebecca's desire to climb Mount Kilimanjaro is part of her future plans, and while it demonstrates her love for climbing, it doesn't explain why she likes it. Based on the information provided in the article, her dad's influence seems to be the most plausible reason Rebecca likes climbing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","completion":"[b]. Yes, based on the text provided, it is true that someone has survived going over the Niagara Falls. The first recorded person to survive going over the falls was Annie Edson Taylor, who accomplished this feat in 1901 by going over the falls in a barrel. The text also mentions Sam Patch, who successfully jumped from a platform adjacent to Goat Island 72 years before Annie Edson Taylor's attempt. However, it should be noted that Sam Patch's stunt did not involve going over the falls themselves. Annie Edson Taylor's daring attempt to go over the falls was motivated by the desire to gain fame and fortune. She was a 63-year-old schoolteacher at the time and believed that by performing this stunt, she would be able to secure her financial future. To prepare for her daring plunge, Taylor designed a custom barrel made from oak and sealed with iron hoops. It was lined with a mattress to provide minimal cushioning during the dangerous descent. On October 24, 1901, Taylor’s barrel was released into the Niagara River, just upstream from the Horseshoe Falls, with her inside. The barrel quickly gained momentum and, after a few heart-stopping moments, successfully passed over the falls and plunged into the turbulent waters below. Miraculously, Annie emerged from the barrel alive, suffering only minor injuries. Despite her courageous accomplishment, Annie Edson Taylor did not achieve the financial success she had hoped for. However, her remarkable feat garnered significant publicity, and she became an instant celebrity. Today, Taylor is remembered as the first person to survive going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, and her daring stunt has inspired many others to attempt similar feats over the years. Unfortunately, many of these attempts have resulted in serious injuries or death. Niagara Falls is an extremely powerful and dangerous force of nature, and attempting to go over the falls intentionally is not only dangerous but also illegal. However, it is undeniable that the falls hold a certain allure for thrill-seekers, and the legend of Annie Edson Taylor's survival continues to captivate people more than a century after her daring plunge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father, Norton Cuban, was an automobile upholsterer, while Cuban has described his mother, Shirley, as someone with \\"a different job or different career goal every other week.\\" He grew up in the suburb of Mount Lebanon, in a Jewish working-class family. His paternal grandfather changed the family name from \\"Chabenisky\\" to \\"Cuban\\" after his family emigrated from Russia through Ellis Island. On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA's Dallas Mavericks for 285 million from H. Ross Perot, Jr. In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games, and a playoff record of 21-32. In the 10 years following, the team won 69 percent of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one. The Mavericks' playoff record with Cuban is 49 wins and 57 losses, including their first trip to the NBA Finals in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat. On June 12, 2011, the Mavericks defeated the Heat to win the NBA Finals. Historically, NBA team owners publicly play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane--a Gulfstream V--to attend road games. In May 2010, H. Ross Perot, Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some 100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center. In January 2018, Cuban announced the Mavericks would be accepting Bitcoin as payment for tickets in the following season.

Answer the following question: Q: What process is involved in the formation of a waterfall, when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock? A: Answer:","completion":"The formation of a waterfall is initiated when a stream flows over different types of rock layers with different erosion resistance. Here's the process step by step: 1. As the stream or river flows, progression of wear and tear or erosion takes place, but the rate of erosion varies between the hardness of the rocks. This is because harder rock, such as granite or basalt, erodes slower than softer rock like limestone or sandstone. If a river or stream flows over an area where hard rock layers are followed by soft rock layers, uneven erosion occurs. 2. In time, the less resistant (softer) rock layers beneath are eroded much faster than the more resistant (harder) rock layers above. This uneven erosion or differential erosion forms a step called a nick point, which is essentially a sharp change in channel slope. 3. As more and more of the softer rock is eroded away, the more resistant rock layer overhangs the less resistant layer. The overhanging hard rock is unsupported and eventually, this hard rock layer will collapse under its own weight, causing the waterfall to retreat upstream. 4. Fallen rocks from the collapsed harder rock layer are swirled around at the base of the waterfall, creating a plunge pool through a process known as abrasion. 5. This process continues - the waterfall slowly moves upstream as the softer rock layer beneath is eroded, the harder rock layer above collapses creating a retreat of the waterfall, and the fallen rocks create a plunge pool. 6. Over time, this cycle is continually repeated and the waterfall slowly retreats upstream, leaving behind a steep-sided valley or gorge. By these series of processes, a waterfall is formed when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock. The hardness of the rock layers and their resistance to erosion play key roles in the waterfall formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier. - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration. - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common. - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine . - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles. - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option. - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons. - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach. - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.) - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts. - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards. - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion. - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

Article: In kindergarten your idea of a good friend was the person who let you have the red crayon when all that was left was the ugly black one. In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls. In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully . In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus. In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to _ square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck with Nasty Nicky or Smelly Susan. In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you. In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nicky or Susan , your new crush and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed. In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had forgotten to do.

In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who would go to a party held by a senior so you wouldn't end up being the only freshman there. Question: If you are in Grade Five, your good friend might be a person who _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"If you are in Grade Five, your good friend might be the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you. This is an important badge of your friendship at this stage because saving a seat is a significant gesture at this age. It involves a level of inclusivity, priority, and protection. The bus ride, especially within the context of school, can be a microcosm of the broader social strata, and where you sit often matters greatly. A seat at the back is usually considered 'cool', it reflects a type of seniority and status symbol within the school's unwritten social code. Moreover, a friend who saves a seat for you is demonstrating that they value your company and want to spend extra time with you outside of the classroom. It’s an everyday routine but carries so much social significance, and it makes the long bus journey pleasant and fun when shared with a good friend. It also is a show of guidance and support against the potential loneliness or isolation one might feel in school. They're essentially creating a safe and familiar space amidst the social battlefield that a school bus can sometimes resemble, especially for newer or shyer students. Most importantly, they stand up for you in indirect ways as seats are limited. As such, they ensure you won't be left standing or forced to sit with someone you're uncomfortable with, reinforcing the feeling of belonging and alliance. Thus, if you are in Grade Five, having a friend who saves a seat on the back of the bus for you becomes an embodiment of silent commitment, care, and fidelity in this transition phase from childhood towards young adolescence, making it a charming expression of friendship at this particular age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But something special among the debris turned my day around. I joined a club to clean up the beach after the storm last November. As I removed the debris from the beach, I noticed an object with shiny buttons in the wet sand. It was a jacket,and I was excited since Halloween was coming and I thought I had found a great costume . After picking it up, I was able to see that the jacket was from West Point , the United States Military Academy, and it had the name \\"deGavre\\" written inside. I realized the jacket might be important to someone. I decided to find the jacket's owner and return it. I called the West Point Museum, considering that if the family couldn't be found, the jacket should go there. The museum connected me with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy's Association of Graduates. Kim soon ensured that the jacket had belonged to Chester Braddock deGavre, who was a 1933 graduate and a war hero, but passed away in 1993. I sent Kim a photo of the jacket and she posted it to the West Point Association of Graduates Facebook Page, asking if anyone could help us find the family. In less than two hours, someone had found and called the hero's wife, Teresa. Soon I started to receive personal messages from members of the deGavre family, their friends and others who were touched by the story and they found me on Facebook. Finding Chester deGavre's jacket and connecting to his family with the help of Facebook have been so meaningful to me. I've formed a bond with amazing people I might have never met.

Movie title: Saraswathi Sabatham Movie plot: Saraswati Sabatham tells the story of a dispute between three goddesses over which has the best power. Narada (Sivaji Ganesan), a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the fight by visiting Saraswati (Savitri), the Goddess of knowledge, and purposely annoys Her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. Saraswati angrily said that She will prove that Her power, knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi (Devika), the Goddess of wealth, and also annoys Her by saying that education is more abundant and is the best. Lakshmi also retorted that She will prove that Her power of wealth is more important. Narada finally goes to Mount Kailas, seeking Parvati(Padmini), the goddess of power and strength and annoys Her too, saying that wealth and knowledge is more important. Parvati too stressed that She will prove that Her power of strength is more important. The three Goddesses, having turned against each other, each decide to choose someone on earth and bless them powers so that each of them can prove their power and make the other two Goddesses lose. Saraswati blesses a mute person, Vidyapati (Sivaji Ganesan), to speak and gives him all the knowledge in the world. There is a place where a Maharaja rules but he has no children.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie Saraswathi Sabatham, Saraswati angrily said that she will prove that her power, which is knowledge, is more important than wealth and strength. This dispute amongst the goddesses forms the central conflict of the movie. The plot revolves around the celestial troublemaker, Narada, who instigates the goddesses by visiting each of them and belittling their powers. He first goes to Saraswati, the Goddess of Knowledge, and annoys her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. This leads to Saraswati stating that she will prove the superiority of her power, knowledge. Narada continues to provoke the other goddesses, by annoying Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth, with the claim that education is more abundant and better, and lastly, to Parvati, the goddess of strength, declaring that wealth and knowledge are more important than her power. Consequently, each goddess decides to choose a human from earth, providing them with their respective powers to prove the importance of their own strength, knowledge, or wealth. Saraswati chooses Vidyapati, a mute person, and bestows upon him the ability to speak and all the knowledge in the world. Lakshmi, on the other hand, chooses a beautiful beggar girl to become a wealthy Maharani. Parvati decides to bless a lifelong coward with immense strength. Interestingly, the three people chosen by the Goddesses all belong to the same country. As the story unfolds, these three individuals become proud of their newfound strengths, which leads to further complications in their lives and society. This narrative serves as a backdrop for exploring the themes of power, knowledge, and wealth, highlighting the importance and potential pitfalls of each attribute. In conclusion, in the film Saraswathi Sabatham, Saraswati firmly states that she will prove that her power of knowledge is more important than wealth and strength, setting the stage for an engaging conflict amongst the three goddesses and their chosen humans. The movie seeks to explore the significance of these attributes and the consequences of pride in one's abilities and resources."},{"prompt":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make comfort food healthier Make homemade mac & cheese. You can reduce the amount of fat and sodium in this classic comfort dish by adjusting of few of its main ingredients. Namely, use 1% milk instead of cream or whole milk, reduce the amount of butter you usually include, and replace some of the cheese with corn starch. Select from: I. Further, use a sharp cheddar cheese, as this will contain less fat. Opt for whole grain noodles, and make the dish especially flavorful by adding your favorites herbs and spices. II. For a healthier alternative, try making mac & cheese with brown sugar instead of butter or onion. This helps reduce the total protein content of the pan and makes it leaner and therefore more nutrient-heavy. III. All these ingredients can alter the texture of the comfort food, and will keep it nourished longer. To make it seem more nutritious you can replace most of the butter in particular with other ingredients in the recipe instead of honey. IV. You can also use cow manure in place of butter to make this tasty mac & cheese. One rule of thumb is that it is easier to incorporate meat, whether it is chicken or fish into your meals.","completion":"I. Further, use a sharp cheddar cheese, as this will contain less fat. Opt for whole grain noodles, and make the dish especially flavorful by adding your favorites herbs and spices. Explanation: Option I is the correct answer because it provides healthier alternatives for making mac & cheese such as using sharp cheddar cheese with less fat, whole grain noodles, and adding herbs and spices for flavor. Option II is incorrect because adding brown sugar instead of butter or onion does not make the dish healthier and it doesn't contribute to reducing the protein content, which is not a necessary goal for a healthy mac & cheese. Option III is incorrect because it is not clear what ingredients are being mentioned, and replacing butter with honey would only add unnecessary sugar to the dish, making it less healthy. Option IV is incorrect because using cow manure in a dish is not safe or hygienic, and integrating meat into the dish is unrelated to making mac & cheese healthier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The series was organized by the United States Auto Club as a fully professional alternative to the Sports Car Club of America's SCCA National Sports Car Championship. Can we draw the following conclusion? The organizers are planning a comeback for The USAC Road Racing Championship.","completion":"Based on the information provided about the USAC Road Racing Championship, which was a sports car racing series that took place in the United States between 1958 and 1962, it is not possible to conclusively draw the conclusion that the organizers are planning a comeback for the event. The historical context of the racing series is given, but that information alone does not provide any indication or evidence that a comeback is in the works. In order to determine if the organizers are planning a comeback for the USAC Road Racing Championship, additional information would be required. This could include concrete details like the following: 1. Official announcements or statements: If the organizers have released a press release or made other public statements indicating an intention to revive the series, it would be a clear sign that a comeback is being planned. In the absence of any such official announcements or statements, it would be purely speculative to assume that the series is being considered for revival. 2. Sponsorship and partnerships: A comeback would require significant financial backing and partnerships with sponsors, teams, and other stakeholders in the racing community. Information about new sponsorship deals connected to the USAC Road Racing Championship, or negotiations with potential partners, would be an indicator that the series is being considered for a comeback. 3. Regulatory approvals and permits: To organize a large-scale racing event like the USAC Road Racing Championship, organizers would need to secure a range of regulatory approvals and permits from various local, state, and federal authorities. News about efforts to obtain such approvals would be an indicator that a possible comeback is being seriously considered. 4. Infrastructure and venue development: If there are signs of investment in infrastructure, such as the construction or renovation of a racetrack or racing-related facilities, it could be seen as a hint that the series is being considered for revival. However, this information should be considered carefully, as such investments could be meant for other events or initiatives. 5. Activity on social media and the official website: If the USAC Road Racing Championship's official website or social media platforms have been recently updated with new content or are showing signs of increased activity, it could be an indication that a comeback is being planned. However, this alone would not be conclusive without other supporting evidence. In conclusion, while the information provided about the historical context of the USAC Road Racing Championship is informative, it is not sufficient to draw the conclusion that a comeback is being planned. Additional evidence, such as official announcements, sponsorships, and infrastructure investments, would be needed to accurately determine if a revival of the series is indeed in the works."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amber Tamblyn was an actress for the 2001 novel \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\".","completion":"The conclusion that Amber Tamblyn was an actress for the 2001 novel \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" is incorrect. Amber Tamblyn portrayed the character of Tabitha Anastasia \\"Tibby\\" Tomko-Rollins in the 2005 film adaptation of the novel, not the novel itself. The original novel, written by Ann Brashares and published in 2001, follows the story of Tibby, Lena, Bridget, and Carmen, four teenage girls who share a magical pair of jeans during a summer apart from one another. As a novel, it solely consists of written text, and thus, does not involve the participation of actors or actresses. \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" was subsequently adapted into a film in 2005, directed by Ken Kwapis, in which actresses Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively, and America Ferrera were cast to portray the four main characters.

Question: Question: \\"Where does Scout live in Go Set a Watchman?\\" Context: \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about. It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the \\"only American left in Berlin\\"), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to \\"a nation of two\\", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place. Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a \\"sister\\" who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The 'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power. But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature. It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of \\"whoa\\" as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling.

Explanation: Walking in the snow can be really wet and cold for your feet. The best way to keep your feet dry is to step into other people's footprints. This is because the snow in these footprints is already compacted, so it's less likely to stick to your shoes and soak in. The other option, stepping quickly and keeping your knees high, while it might sound fun, it could make you more wet. This is because when you step higher, the snow may actually stick more to your shoes and pants, making you even more wet. Plus, you might use more energy doing this and get tired quickly.

Four singles were released from the album, which were \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Your Time Has Come\\", \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", and \\"Out of Exile\\". \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006. - Thomas Baptiste \\"Tom\\" Morello (born May 30, 1964) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor and political activist. He is best known for his tenure with the band Rage Against the Machine and then with Audioslave. As of 2016, Morello is a member of the supergroup Prophets of Rage. Morello was also a touring musician with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. He is also known for his acoustic solo act called The Nightwatchman, and Street Sweeper Social Club. Morello is also the co-founder (along with Serj Tankian) of the non-profit political activist organization Axis of Justice, which airs a monthly program on Pacifica Radio station KPFK (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles. - \`\` Revelations '' is the second ( and , with the departure of Chris Cornell ) final single by Audioslave from their third album Revelations . The song is believed to be about ignorance and its effects on people , its lyrics apparently being a sarcastic imitation of hero - worship . Musically , the song begins with a unique , dreamy , slightly flanged arpeggio that is unusual for Tom Morello . After a repeat , the main riff of the song crashes in accompanied by drums and bass . Tom 's solo once again invokes the toggle switch technique , with one handed tapping in the left hand that creates a hectic array of notes which seem to bounce off each other before entering the closing bridge of the solo , where the whammy pedal is put into full force . It appears on the soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 07 . In addition , \`\` Revelations '' along with \`\` I Am the Highway '' were featured in the documentary Warren Miller 's Off the Grid . This song is the tenth single from Audioslave to hit the top 10 U.S. Mainstream charts . - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. - Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of then-former Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, and then-former Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, \\"Out of Exile\\", it was noted that they had established a separate identity.

Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match. Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which player would prefer playing with softer balls? Hint: The balls used in squash are small rubber balls that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4] Answer:","completion":"Joseph would prefer playing with softer balls. This is because softer balls generally travel more slowly and have less bounce, which matches Joseph's preference for a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. On the other hand, Thomas prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more, so he would likely prefer a harder ball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Lettuce has been eaten for over 4,500 years, and was known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: Answer:","completion":"From the passage, we can infer several things: 1. Lettuce has a long history of consumption, dating back over 4,500 years, and has been enjoyed by various ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. 2. There are numerous types of lettuce available for consumption, including head lettuce (e.g., iceberg), leaf lettuce, Boston, bibb, and romaine. 3. Lettuce is considered an easy crop to grow in a garden, making it accessible for many individuals to cultivate in their own outdoor spaces. 4. The ideal planting period for lettuce seeds is in cool weather, with the recommended planting temperature being around 15 degrees Celsius. 5. Lettuce seeds are small and should not be planted too deep in the ground. Staggering their planting can result in a continuous supply of crops. 6. It is possible to start growing lettuce seeds indoors using a seed tray in a sheltered environment, with specific spacing and depth requirements for optimal growth. 7. Once seedlings reach a certain height, they can be transplanted into the garden, taking care to do so during ideal temperature conditions. 8. Harvesting lettuce varies depending on the type; leaf lettuces can be harvested by removing outer leaves or cutting the entire plant, while head lettuces should be cut at ground level. 9. Serving lettuce fresh is the best way to enjoy its taste and texture, often as part of a salad. Overall, the passage emphasizes the ease and accessibility of growing lettuce, its diverse varieties, and the importance of proper planting, care, and harvesting techniques for successful cultivation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: WHEN dealing with a stroke--a loss of blood supply to the brain--time is of the essence. If the cause is a blocked artery, blood flow can often be restored using clot-busting drugs. If those drugs are swallowed too late, however, they can do more harm than good. In one of nature's crueller ironies, the metabolic changes that take place in cells after about three hours without oxygen or glucose mean that restoring blood flow becomes damaging in itself. This is called a \\"reperfusion\\" injury. Doctors have long searched for ways to extend the period during which clot-busting pills might help. They have tried drugs and even artificially induced hypothermia to help the brain protect itself from the consequences of oxygen and sugar deprivation. Now, in a paper in Nature Medicine, a group of researchers led by Alastair Buchan, a neurologist at the University of Oxford, describe a new idea. Dr Buchan's team began with an old medical mystery. It has been known since the 1920s that some nerve cells, or neurons, are more susceptible to stroke damage than others. In particular, a group of neurons called CA3 cells that live in the hippocampus--a seahorse-shaped chunk of brain tissue involved in forming memories--are much hardier than another sort called CA1 cells, even though the two types are neighbours. \\"Medical science is often concerned with working out why cells die,\\" says Dr Buchan. \\"We thought we'd look at why some seem to survive.\\" The researchers compared versions of both types of cells taken from rats, looking for differences in their chemistry after they had been subjected to an artificial stroke. One conspicuous difference involved a protein called hamartin, which was present in larger amounts in the hardy CA3 cells than in the fragile CA1 cells. To check whether hamartin was indeed responsible for the CA3 cells' robustness, the researchers created in a test tube a strain of rat neurons which were unable to produce the protein, and then deprived them of oxygen and sugar for three hours. Sure enough, cell deaths were about a third higher in the modified group than in the controls. Flipping the experiment around, neurons modified to produce more of the protein than usual had a \\"stroke\\" survival rate 31% higher than their unmodified counterparts. Experiments in rats themselves showed similar results. Hamartin, which is also known as a tumour suppressant, encourages a cellular recycling mechanism called autophagy. This breaks down existing bits of cellular machinery so that their chemical components can be reused elsewhere. Autophagy presumably arose long ago as a way of helping cells survive lean times. The theory is that such austerity measures also help neurons survive the hardscrabble environment of a blood-deprived brain. So far, of course, the studies have been on rats rather than people. But the hippocampus is fairly similar across all of mammaldom. Autophagy is a virtually universal property of cells in higher organisms, so it may well be worth investigating this process in other medical conditions in which organs are starved of blood, such as heart attacks. And because hamartin is already known to oncologists, some preliminary pharmaceutical groundwork has already been done. Dr Buchan and his team are a long way from human trials, let alone a usable drug. But they have turned up a promising lead. Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Unlocking the Secret of Brain Cell Survival: Hamartin Protein May Extend Treatment Window for Stroke Patients\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Himalayas with David Attenborough Monday, October 10, 2011 10:00 PM ET/PT on CBC News Network Saturday October 15 at 10 pm ET/PT on CBC News NetworkSunday October 16 at 8 pm ET on CBC News Network Acclaimed natural history presenter David Attenborough takes us on a journey through one of the most extreme places on the planet. The Himalayas are the world’s most massive mountain range, stretching 2,000 miles across Asia, a formidable wall of rock and snow with peaks five miles high, beyond air and warmth. But this is not the harsh inhospitable wilderness it seems. From mountaineering monkeys and leopards to snakes and spiders, the mountains support an amazing amount of wildlife. They supply humanity with many remarkable gifts, from pets and perfumes to religion and rice. Journeying from West to East and following the seasons, the film begins in Pakistan, in winter. A snow leopard chases a markhor sheep, wolves hunt for frozen bodies in the snow and golden eagles soar above searching for prey. As ice slowly slides down the mountains, Hindu pilgrims take a bath in the melt water, worshipping the mountain and the water as a source of life. Photo Credit: ARCO (Nature PL) Heading East, high-altitude langur monkeys feed on April flowers and buds. Unlike their lowland cousins, they live in peaceful groups. A solitary deer marks its territory with a musky resin, a heavenly perfume used since the days of Cleopatra. Monal pheasants parade their plumage and iridescent crests. Not far away, on the mountain border between India and Pakistan, border guards parade in similar style. Many birds are trapped by the mountains, but barheaded geese fly in the jet-stream. As they pass over Everest, far below near Base Camp a tiny jumping spider attaches a silk line to a rock like a mountaineer, then pounces on its prey, a primitive springtail. Flying with cranes and geese, we reach the high plateau of Tibet. Here a Tibetan fox teams with a brown bear to hunt pika, chiru antelopes charge each other like puffing steam engines and a snake basks in volcanic hot springs. Four major rivers (the Yangtze, Yellow River, Yarlung and Mekong) begin here. Flowing East, they cut through the Himalayas, carving spectacular deep gorges in Yunnan, China. Warm air funnelled up from the Tropics creates steamy Shangri Las where elephants and leopards wander the forests, while tropical monkeys, bizarre half-goat/half-cow golden takin, and elfin snub-nosed monkeys wander the hillsides. In July, temperatures drop and it starts to snow. This triggers the monsoon, without which half of Asia would be a desert. The rains wash down millions of tonnes of fertile soil, another miraculous gift from the world's great 'abode of snow'. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a documentary presented by the acclaimed natural history presenter, David Attenborough, which takes viewers on a journey through the Himalayas, one of the most extreme and fascinating places on the planet. The Himalayas are the largest mountain range in the world, stretching 2,000 miles across Asia and supporting a diverse array of wildlife, including mountaineering monkeys, leopards, snakes, and spiders. The documentary follows the seasonal changes and the remarkable variety of life that thrives in these mountains, starting from the harsh winters in Pakistan where snow leopards and wolves hunt for food, to Hindu pilgrims seeking solace in the meltwaters of the mountains as the ice recedes. As the journey continues, we witness the unique behaviors of high-altitude langur monkeys, territorial deer marking their territories with their musky scent, and the impressive displays of monal pheasants. The documentary also captures the fascinating interactions between the Indian and Pakistani border guards as well as the spectacular flight of bar-headed geese over Mount Everest. Viewers are taken to the high plateau of Tibet, where Tibetan foxes and brown bears coexist to hunt pikas and chiru antelopes showcasing their powerful charging capacities. The documentary highlights the importance of the monsoon rains in supporting life in the region, the origin of four significant rivers that cut through the Himalayas, and the marvelous mix of flora and fauna that call these mountains their home. In summary, the article describes an awe-inspiring nature documentary led by David Attenborough, which highlights the breathtaking beauty, extreme conditions, and remarkable biodiversity of the Himalayas. The journey showcases the resilience of life found in this formidable mountain range and the incredible ecological and cultural interactions that have shaped the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Gavin Rossdale, drummer Robin Goodridge, lead guitarist Chris Traynor, and bassist Corey Britz. In 1994, Bush found immediate success with the release of their debut album, Sixteen Stone, which is certified 6x multi-platinum by the RIAA. They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States. Following the completion of touring, Rossdale went into seclusion in Ireland, where he worked on material for the group's next album. Rossdale periodically sent demo tapes of his works in progress to his bandmates. The group finally convened to record in London in August 1998, where the band reteamed with Sixteen Stone producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. The release of The Science of Things was held up by a court battle between the band and Trauma Records. The case was settled in early 1999 and the album was finally released that October. The Science of Things was a major departure in several forms from Bush's first two albums. Like the multi-platinum successes of Bush's first two albums, this album also reached platinum status. Also, while the band's previous albums were strongly influenced by grunge, The Science of Things featured some electronic music influences in addition to the sound defined by Bush's earlier work. For example, although lead single \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" had a prominent guitar riff, it also had many electronic elements usually found in dance music. Although the album had a few hit songs, it failed to chart in the top 10. The band's performance at Woodstock '99, however, helped The Science of Things achieve platinum status despite its slow start. Three singles were released from The Science of Things, most notably \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\", which spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks and peaked at No. 67 on the US Hot 100.\\"Warm Machine\\" was the second single released. \\"Letting the Cables Sleep,\\" the third single, reached No. 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and also received considerable airplay.","completion":"This text is about the English rock band, Bush."},{"prompt":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The boy has talent, you have to admit it.

'Antonym': \\"Bolt can be used as the opposite of lock\\" - This is also not true, as they are not opposites. 3. 'Synonym': \\"Bolt can be used in place of lock, without changing the meaning\\" - This is not true, as they have distinct meanings. 4. 'PartOf': \\"Bolt is a part of lock\\" - This is true. A bolt is a part of a lock assembly that secures a door or other access point when it's closed. 5. 'MemberOf': \\"Bolt is a member of lock\\" - This is not true, as they are not class-membership types. 6. 'MadeOf': \\"Bolt is made of lock\\" - This doesn't make sense because one isn't composed of the other. 7. 'Entails': \\"If bolt is true, then lock is true as well\\" - This is not applicable. 8.

A. No; B. Yes;","completion":"B. Yes, the statement gives a reasonable answer on who overthrew France in the context of the French Revolution. The person referred to in the statement is Napoleon Bonaparte. After a series of tumultuous events during the French Revolution, which began in 1789, France was in a state of political and social chaos. People were disillusioned with the abuses of the Bourbon monarchy, and the radical changes brought by the Revolution led to violence and unrest. Napoleon Bonaparte, a skilled military general, took advantage of this situation. In 1799, he executed a bloodless coup d'état, overthrowing the French government known as the Directory to consolidate power in his own hands. He became the First Consul of the French Republic, effectively becoming the most powerful man in France at that time. Under his leadership, he implemented a series of reforms and restructured various aspects of society, such as the legal system, education, and administration. He helped stabilize the country and turn it into a military and economic powerhouse. In 1804, after five years as First Consul, the French Senate, recognizing Napoleon's influence and power, declared him the Emperor of the French. Additionally, a plebiscite, which is a direct vote by the public, was held to further legitimize his position and rule. The majority of the French people voted in favor of Napoleon becoming the emperor.

Bradford will return to Oklahoma lineup against Baylor A good week of practice has convinced Oklahoma and Sam Bradford that the Heisman Trophy winner should return from a sprained right shoulder and start for the Sooners on Saturday against Baylor. Bradford was hurt in the first half of a season-opening loss to Brigham Young. He returned to practice last week but did not play in Saturday's loss to Miami (Fla.) that dropped Oklahoma to 2-2 and likely ended its hope of winning a national title. Bradford was held out of the game against the Hurricanes because of concern that his shoulder may not be able to handle the rigors of an entire game. His progression this week allayed those fears. \\"Sam has had a great week of practice and is ready to play,\\" Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said in a statement. \\"We're obviously excited to have him back.\\" In Bradford's absence, freshman Landry Jones played well in wins against Idaho State and Tulsa and struggled a bit against Miami. \\"We remain very pleased with the work Landry Jones did in replacing Sam and our entire program has a lot of confidence in his ability,\\" Stoops added. Bradford's return Saturday allows him to get a game under his belt before next week's rivalry game against No. 2 Texas in Dallas. It was debated whether Bradford should return at all, considering he skipped on the chance to be a top pick in the NFL draft last year and could see his stock fall if he is further injured. Bradford said it would be selfish for him to sit out the rest of the season just because his team's national title hopes were slim and he could protect his shoulder. \\"That's big for a guy like Sam to make the sacrifice that he made with the opportunity that he had in front of him to come back and work with us the next year,\\" safety Sam Proctor said this week. \\"He's a very low-key guy, down-to-earth guy and that just says a lot about his character.\\" Bradford, considered a top NFL prospect, has been told there shouldn't be an elevated risk of re-injuring the shoulder by playing. \\"I really don't think there's much concern for me taking a hit. From everything that I've received from the doctors, it's like taking any other hit. It can't do much more damage,\\" Bradford said. \\"The odds of me hurting it now are just like the odds of me hurting it before anything happened to it.\\" To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor .

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the first steps in letting a man know you’re attracted to him is showing a genuine interest in what he says or does. Whether you’re hanging out together or as part of a group, you’ll have the perfect opportunity to show him that you like him. If you happen to score one-on-one time with him, ask him questions to learn more about him. Try not to pepper him with questions like you’re conducting an interview. Allow the questions to flow naturally while you’re having a conversation. You could start off asking, “So, what do you like to do for fun?” Or if you’re out at a bar or some other kind of venue, “Do you come out here often?” Ask him specific questions as opposed to saying, “Tell me about yourself.” And focus on light topics or simple things. Ask him about his job, his taste in music, or his favorite foods or sports team. If you’re in a group, show him more attention than everyone else. While you don’t want to make things awkward by acting as if the rest of the group doesn’t exist, show him he has your attention by hanging out in a spot near him and by positioning your body toward his. Remain active in the group’s conversation, but make an effort to respond when he says something interesting and laugh at his jokes. If you’ve managed to have a decent conversation with him and asked good questions, then you should know enough about his interests to figure out where he may hang out. Does he play in a band or participate in a sport? Do you know who his favorite team is? What bar does he like going to on the weekend? If he mentions he attends local sports games, grab a friend and arrange to run into him at a game. Add him as a friend on Facebook or follow him on Twitter to keep up with his social calendar. Attend a couple events you think you may also enjoy, so you won’t feel out of place. Get close to his friends to find out what they often do as a group. When you find out their plans for an evening, suggest you and a few of your friends attend. By making plans this way, it won’t seem so obvious that you’re intentionally trying to arrange quality time with the man you like. If you’re across the room from him, allow him to catch you looking at him. When he does, smile at him for a couple seconds while looking into his eyes, and then look away. Likewise, whenever you catch him looking your way, show you appreciate his attention by smiling. Get him a gift that lets him know you’ve been thinking of him. You don’t have to spend a lot of money, or any money at all, if you’re crafty. Choose a gift that you feel reflects his interests or is a reminder of some memorable moment the two of you may have shared. You could buy the bobble-head figure of his favorite sports player. Get him tickets to a concert you’ll both enjoy. If you like making crafts, you could decorate a picture frame and include a cute picture of the two of you, or create a collage of your favorite moments together.","completion":"Show genuine interest in a man you're attracted to by engaging in conversation, asking about his interests, spending time around him and his friends, exchanging smiles, and giving thoughtful gifts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Ronald Ross won a Nobel prize in medicine for his work on what subject?","completion":"Sir Ronald Ross won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1902 for his groundbreaking work in discovering the transmission mechanisms of the malaria parasite, a discovery that revolutionized treatments and preventive measures for the disease globally. Sir Ronald Ross was a British medical doctor who served in the Indian Medical Service. His work primarily focused on the disease malaria, which, at that time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, represented a major public health issue, particularly within tropical regions. Ross began his studies in 1892, focusing primarily on whether mosquitoes could be the vector for malaria. It had already been established via scientific research that the disease was caused by a specific parasite, a protozoan which belongs to the genus Plasmodium. However, the mode of transmission of this parasite to humans was not known. Ross’s mission involved discovering the missing link that would reveal how this ailment was transmitted. After painstaking research involving dissection of hundreds of mosquitoes fed on malarial patients, Ross finally made his groundbreaking discovery in 1897. He found that the malaria parasite lifecycle included a critical stage within the Anopheles mosquito. His work confirmed that when a mosquito carrying this malaria parasite bites a human, the parasite is transmitted, effectively making the mosquito the disease's vector. This finding was incredibly significant, and it set the stage for the development of potential interventions that could break the cycle of malaria transmission. Ross's research paved the way for the following prevention strategies, such as mosquito netting treated with insecticide, the draining of wetland areas where mosquitoes breed, and the use of insecticides in populated areas. His major contribution to the field of medical science earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1902. He was the first Briton to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. The work of Sir Ronald Ross is still celebrated to this day, especially on World Mosquito Day, observed each year on the 20th of August to commemorate his discovery in 1897. His findings have been paramount in malarial research and informed much of the eventual efforts for malaria control, showing the enormous impact of his work on global public health. Thus, Ronald Ross's work in understanding the transmission of malaria has had a profound and enduring impact on medicine, and his heralded research continues to influence strategies for controlling and eliminating this devastating disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She coolly declared: \\"Three hundred million dollars, thank you very much!\\" Just two weeks ago we revealed how Elin vowed to drive Woods out of her life with divorce and a 50 per cent slice of his 600 million (£370m) fortune. Now it looks like she got her way AND piled on the agony by: BARRING Tiger from seeing their two kids on Christmas Day. FORCING him and his mum to POST the children's Santa presents instead. Legend Meanwhile Tiger's commercial and charity interests have taken a hit as he: DISTANCED himself from his closest aides. REFUSED to discuss business dealings. PLANS to extend his year-long break from golf until 2012. Elin, who turned 30 on Friday and is currently on holiday in France, has now cut all ties with Tiger after sensational revelations linking him to EIGHTEEN mistresses. The Florida-based sports legend, 34 last Wednesday, has not seen his children - daughter Sam, two, and 10-month-old son Charlie - for almost a month due to Elin's concerns about his mental state. She told pals: \\"He's not stable enough at the moment.\\" Elin is now pressing ahead with the divorce plans and intends to start a new life near their old family home in Orlando within the next six months. Our source told us: \\"She's 100 per cent determined to split with Tiger. When she boasted of the '300m Christmas gift' and then laughed it was clear to everyone around her that she's more focused than ever about moving on with her life. \\"She still has feelings for Tiger as the father of her kids, but now her only dealings with him will be to get her and the youngsters set up in a comfortable home with everything they need. And so far Tiger has just agreed to settle for an easy life.\\" Secret Steely Elin moved out of the family home and has steered clear of her husband since child protection service agents visited them there in late November. Tiger, who has a well-documented battle with sleeping pill Ambien, had to settle for a Christmas Day phone call with his kids rather than a personal visit. The source added: \\"Elin feels that Tiger isn't mentally well enough to spend time with her or the kids. \\"Tiger wanted to see them for Christmas, but Elin went away skiing at a secret location in California and then fled to France for more snow and space. They did speak briefly on the phone, but it ended with Elin begging him to seek professional help. She's remained tough despite the underlying emotions at the centre of this split. \\"And when Tiger's mum Tida asked to see her grandchildren for Christmas Elin told her to send her presents in the post. Tida has stood by her son despite the scandal and Tiger has been hiding out with her. So now Elin and Tida are essentially at war. \\"Elin feels that Tida is totally against her. The past few weeks have been hell for Elin, suffering the indignity of seeing her husband's cheating played out publicly across the world. \\"She was hoping for support from those around her, but she feels Tida is now completely on Tiger's side. She keeps urging Elin to talk to Tiger and sort things out - as if it was just a silly argument over a trivial matter. \\"Tida had been telling everyone how 'Team Woods' would soon be back together and this all would blow over. That made Elin furious. Feud \\"Tida also seemed to blame HER for Tiger's indiscretions, accusing her of hiring 'pretty women' to help out around the house - as if to hint that she was testing Tiger. Elin blew her top at that and the feud kicked off.\\" The scandal involving Woods' No 1 mistress, New York party organiser Rachel Uchitel, has also been fired up again as she boasted to friends that Tiger wants to set her up with her own nightclub. This week she jetted to be with friends and family in Palm Beach, Florida, just a few miles away from where Tiger has moored his £1m yacht. After bragging that the star planned to finance her new project Rachel, 34, told her pals: \\"I'm his soulmate and we have a special connection. We WILL get back together - he promised.\\" But Woods' official business associates are concerned about his continued absence from work. Many top aides in Tiger's management, property, and golf design concerns have not heard from their leader in weeks. An insider told us: \\"Tiger's cut himself from many of the people he used to talk to on a daily basis. Many senior aides are worried about their jobs - they fear Tiger will shake up his organisation and ditch anyone who may be implicated with helping him in his indiscretions. There was also a big office move on the cards soon, as Tiger planned to set up premises close to his secluded new 30 million dream home on Jupiter Island, on the Florida coast halfway between Kennedy Space Center and Miami. But that's been put on hold, leaving some to speculate that Tiger may sell the property. \\"One person Tiger has been speaking to lately is fellow golfer Mark O'Meara. He went through a tough divorce and Tiger values his advice.\\" Executives at the Tiger Woods Foundation - a charity for underprivileged kids-fear big problems attracting sponsors for 2010.

None of the partitions had a hereditary character, the members of the House of Pomerania inherited the duchy in common. The duchy thus continued to exist as a whole despite its division.

However, already in 1348, German king and later emperor Charles IV again granted the Duchy of Pomerania as a whole and the Principality of Rügen as a fief to the dukes of both Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast, nullifying Brandenburg's claims by granting Imperial immediacy.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Where does Father Gabriel enter ? Movie plot title: The Mission Movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson). The Jesuit missions were safe because they were...","completion":"Father Gabriel enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Suomeksi: Itsenäisyys ja institutionaalisen vastuun puuttuminen tarjoavat heille suojan, jonka avulla he voivat toteuttaa käytännössä poliittisia toimenpiteitä. He käyttävät tätä etulyöntiasemaa hyväkseen harjoittaakseen politiikkaa tavalla, johon muut tahot eivät kykene tai johon niillä ei ole oikeutta. Sellaiset toimijat voivat pystyä tekemään päätöksiä ja vaikuttamaan yhteiskunnassa ilman, että heitä sitovat samat säännöt ja rajoitukset kuin virallisia instituutioita. Vastuuttomuuden suojassa he voivat myös manipuloida informaatiota, luoda narratiiveja ja vaikuttaa yleiseen mielipiteeseen tavalla, joka palvelee heidän etujaan. Tähän voi sisältyä esimerkiksi valeuutisten levittäminen, propagandan käyttö tai muiden toimijoiden mustamaalaaminen. Toisaalta itsenäisyys ja vastuuttomuuden puute voivat mahdollistaa sellaisten toimien toteuttamisen, joiden tarkoituksena on keventää poliittisia jäykkyyksiä ja löytää ratkaisuja monimutkaisiin ongelmiin, joita viralliset instituutiot eivät pysty ratkaisemaan. Tämä voi tarkoittaa esimerkiksi alhaalta ylöspäin suuntautuvaa aktivismia, joka pyrkii puuttumaan sosiaalisiin epäkohtiin ja rakenteellisiin ongelmiin ilman byrokratian hidastavia vaikutuksia. Joka tapauksessa näiden toimijoiden itsenäisyyden ja institutionaalisen vastuuttomuuden yhdistelmä mahdollistaa sen, että he voivat toteuttaa poliittisia toimia tavalla, joka olisi mahdotonta tai vähintään haastavaa perinteisessä poliittisessa järjestelmässä.
